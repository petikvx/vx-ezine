Well, I know we've only done it once, but we are throwing out the old newsletter format and getting a new one. I don't have to time nor the patience to edit the articles and then place them in one .txt file and try to do ascii art. So now the new format will just be article by article. You just find the one you want and read it. Tell me what you think.
