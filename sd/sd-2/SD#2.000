[English Part]
     Welcome to the official Shadow Dancer e-zine, an e-zine which  contains 
viral materials for all  of us,  from beginner  to advance  (depends on  the 
writer  of  article/virii).  Thiz  is our  second zine  after 5  months doin 
nothing  except  gatherin articles  & viriis  from members  and contributor. 
Hmm.. talking bout members..., yeah we got several new members. But we  lost 
our contact with M0RPH3R, maybe he has finished his study.  But at  least he 
has wrote two articles bout macro viriis. zer0_cod3, he's from hacking scene 
but interested in macro virii. I met him in IRC.  He wrote  nothin for  thiz 
zine coz his monitor out of order. AsmHead, a well known virii writer in the 
virii scene, he was part of NoMercy Virus Team and Kefrens. Now..  he's join 
us to share his knowledge. And the last one, FoV DJ, another macro coder, he 
wrote a macro virii for this zine. Yeah... that's all bout our  new members. 
But... we got a contributor, Syvatex/NumLocK, that wrote two viriis for this 
zine.
     Our first  zine didnt  spread widely.   But with  the help  of serveral 
friends, SD zine #1 was anounced  on serveral  underground IRC  channels. In 
our last zine, I (Ding Lik) promised to include DLCVG  pakage in  the second 
zine. But I think it's not important, u can dl it directly  to our  official 
site. And other promises, sorry cant keep my promises :(. But we glad to get 
respons from several Indonesian virii writers (who became our members  now). 
Keep going Indonesian virii writers!

     Selamat datang di Shadow Dancer e-zine, sebuah e-zine yg berisi  materi 
tetang  virus  untk  kita  semua,  dari  pemula sampai  lanjutan (tergantung 
penulis virus/artikel). Ini adl zine ke-2 setelah 5 bulan ngga ngapa-ngpain, 
kecuali ngumpulin artikel dan virus dari para anggota dan kontributor.  Hm.. 
ngomong2  soal  anggota,  SDT  mendapat  beberapa  anggota  baru.   Tapi SDT 
kehilangan  kontak  dgn  M0RPH3R,  mungkin  dia  udah  nyelesaiin  studinya. 
Setidaknya dia udah nulis dua artikel ttg virus  makro. zer0_cod3,  dia dari 
dunia hacking, tapi tertarik dg virus makro. Gue ketemu dia di IRC. Saat ini 
dia ngga nulis apa2,  soalnya monitornya  rusak. AsmHead,  cukup dikenal  di 
dunia virus,  dulu dia  anggota NoMercy  Virus Team  dan Kefrens.   Skrg dia 
bergabung dg SDT untk membagi pengetahuannya.  Dan yg terakir, FoV DJ, koder 
makro lainnya, dia menulis virus makro buat zine  ini. Yeah....   segitu ttg 
anggota  baru  SDT.   Tapi  SDT  mendapatkan   kontribusi  dua   virus  dari 
Syvatex/NumLocK.
