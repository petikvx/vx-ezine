From  Wladimir van der Laan  -   Anti-Debugging Tricks.

1) Push a routine on the stack (Decoded offcourse)
1.5) It could be aligned to an segment.
2) CLI
3) Set the SP so a possible interrupt will overwrite the end of the pushed
routine (SP=SP+DECODED_ROUTINE_LENGTH)
4) Initialize some variables like SI,DI,CX. Of course it must be hidden
perfectly ;-)
5) Jump to the routine.

The routine:
6) Decode a byte/word of the program \
7) Set SP=SP-DECODED_ROUTINE_LENGTH  / THIS SECTION MUST BE NOT TOO LONG (CLI)

8) STI
9) CMP CX,0 (Or whatever)
10) JE @END_OF_DECODE
11) CLI
12) SP=SP+DECODED_ROUTINE_LENGTH (Will be overwitten again ;-)
13) JMP @6
14) @END_OF_DECODE: JMP PROG_SEG:0100h (Or whatever)

Make this as complex as possible. This will stop TD AND TD386 AND SOFTICE,
because they use the stack. (INT 3/1) And don't forget some hardware int's, they
will be enabled in the debugger.. (Even with CLI)

For a working implementation, see TBAV..
