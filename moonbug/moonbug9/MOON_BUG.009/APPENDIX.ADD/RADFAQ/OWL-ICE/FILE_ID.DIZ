NO MORE annoying anti SOFT-ICE tricks!

These MSUB scripts will let you change
the magic values of the INT3 interface
of SOFT-ICE to anything you want!

(MSUB.EXE is a universal search&replace
utility, able to work in binary mode)

Don't forget to change LDR.EXE as well!

This patch was tested with version 2.80
but should work (perhaps with a few
modifications) for other versions, too.
