TDIE V1.0 by Flitnic and me

After my first Virus(Gipsy) I tried to make a Virus, wich isn't visble
in ToolsMacros and wich has no macro name or external Subs. So I tried
to Infect by ThisDocument.Document_Open. In the first time I've got
many problems, but then it worked and worked better. The last bugs 
were smashed by Flitnic. Flitnic brought out IIS wich works much 
better, but also very slow. So came TDIE V2.0
