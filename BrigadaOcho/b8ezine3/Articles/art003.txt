One good thing about twitter is I can say "What's up?" to @BillGates and I'm rest assured
that he gets to read it. If he's on the mood, he may reply but for sure he'll just ignore it.
But my objective is met, that is establishing an initial connection to a famous person.

Which was not possible in the age of snail mail..
