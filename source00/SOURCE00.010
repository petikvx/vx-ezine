                 Hacking Into Meridian Voice Mail Systems!
                 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


      Meridian is one of  the easiest  voice mail systems to hack into.  You
   can typically get a unused box in a matter  of minutes. If you don't know
   what a  meridian system  sounds like,  dial (800)765-9898, and press one.
   This will send you to the extension called 'Express Messaging, Mailbox?'.
   If you hear that, then  chances are, is it's a meridian system.  Also try
   pressing two, and you'll  be connected to  'Meridian Mail, Mailbox?'.  If
   you hear that,  Bingo,  it's  definatly  a Meridian  system, as  the name
   implies.

      Basically,  what  Meridian is, is  a PBX  service (thus  the outdials)
   which many companies use, because they have alot of  extensions.  It also
   has a voice mail box feature,  which is what we want to be checking into.

      From Express Messaging, try  dialing a four digit  mailbox number, and
   then press pound.  If it's a  valid box,  you'll be  transfered to it, if
   not, then  enter another one.  Once you have a box number, press pound to
   quit the message.  Press  7681 to  delete the  message, and login.  Enter
   the  box number,  pound, and  the box  number and  pound  again  for  the
   password.  That's the default password of meridian systems.  If you don't
   get in, keep  trying  until you  get into  a box.  It will give you three
   tries, before hanging up.

      Ok, so your in, now what?  Try to  determine whether or not the box is
   being used.  It has a pretty good help menu there, press 'star' to access
   it. If  there aren't  any messages, don't assume it's open. If there is a
   message,  listen to  it by  pressing two.   Check the  date, if  it's the
   latest message,  and it's old,  then you got  yourself a box, but if it's
   new, and of some  importance then  just write  the number  down for later
   use.  It  can be  of assistance  for getting  new mailboxes.  Back to the
   thing  about no  messages.  Press  89, 8212, or  8222  to  check  for the
   greetings.  If there is one, try leaving a blank message in it, to see if
   someone  will  listen to  it.  If so,  then (obviously) it's  being used,
   otherwise, it's yours.

      Say  you don't  have your  own box yet,  but you  have a used box.  To
   easily scan out the  system, press 75.  This is the easiest way to do it.
   It will  ask you for the  mailbox(es) to  send a message  to, and it will
   display the greeting if it has one.  Keep on going, until you  get enough
   box numbers,  then press  #5#76 to  delete the message.  Then try hacking
   into those boxes.  If the box doesn't  have the default password, just go
   on, as it's not worth it, there are plenty of boxes on the system.

      Ok, so now you have a box, what do I do now?  Try personalizing it, by
   pressing 8215.  Record  your greeting, and when you're done, press pound,
   and four to exit back to the main  menu.  To  change your password, press
   84. If you change your password, you can't change it back to the original
   one for a while (Meridian  Anti-Hacker precaution, well, one of them), so
   keep that in mind before you change the password.

      Cool,  I have  a box,  what can  I do  with it?   You can  start up  a
   codeline, but if your  reading this text file,  then you probably  aren't
   good enough to get enough NEW info to start one up.  Anyone can just call
   other codelines, leech their  codes, and post them on your box, but don't
   be a lamer and do that.  It just kills  the info faster.  Dialout did you
   say?  try pressing 0, 9 (to get an outside line),  then the number.  Some
   systems  I ran  into only  can dial  800 numbers, but  then again alot of
   people post 800 codes,  so it's an  ideal way to use  that code,  besides
   from a  payphone.  If that  doesn't work,  try pressing 801 to change the
   'operator number'.  You always  have to dial 9  before the number, if you
   don't, you'll just be calling other boxes.  The  09ACN feature works even
   if you don't have a box,  such as when you find a box that you don't have
   a password to, and you press #09ACN.

      Another thing that you can do, is start scanning 0(Box Number)#, as on
   one system,  I found  a Meridian  Menu  Maintaince,  which allowed  me to
   change ANY of the menus around. Just look around the system, I found mine
   at box 7250, but I doubt it's the default.

      This  should be  enough information  for you to begin hacking meridian
   systems, and dialout through them.  What are you doing still reading this
   text  file, as  I have stressed before,  GET OUT THERE AND HACK!  You can
   read all you want, but get out there and do it!
