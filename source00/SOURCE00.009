Hacking Calling Cards

Yo Folks.

     Here's a little file on how to hack a persons calling card number. Anyone
can do it. It just takes a little practice. Here's what ya need.

    1: A phone.
    2: A phone book (preferably out-of-state, but any will do).

Recommended:

    1: A computer nearby (for those nice typing effects).
    2: Something that makes a 'beep' sound.

It also helps to do this on a conference, but it can be done anywhere.

Step One: Choosing a Victim
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Pick a name out of the phone book.  Choose one that has only 10-15 entries.
Don't bother with Jones or Smith.  This is also a great way to get back at
enemies.  You can get their calling card # and rack up a huge bill on it.

Now that you have a victim, we may proceed to the next step.

Step Two: Obtaining the card
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Step By Step, Here we go.

        -1- Dial Victim

        -2- 'Beep' Party into conference (if possible)

        -3- Go into script


Heres a sample conversation:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


Hacker: Hello Ma'am this is (Fake Name Here) from AT&T.

Victim: Yes?

Hacker: I have a collect call from a Mrs. Bonehead, will you accept the charges?

Victim: Yes, I will.

        (Now here is where they start to ask questions. Expect to hear 'What's
        the first name' or 'Where are they calling from'. Don't panic, just
        relax and say...

    'I'm sorry, I don't have that information on my screen right now.'
 or 'I cant disclose that information until you pay for the call.'

        To comfort them, say that all you can pinpoint is that the call is
        coming from the area that they are living in. This will make them more
        willing to accept the charges.)


If all goes well they will agree to accept the call.

Hacker: One moment Ma'am while I connect your call.

        (Make typing noises to make it sound realistic)

Hacker (after 4 or 5 seconds): I am having a trouble connecting this call.  It
       seems you have a tollblock intalled on your line which is not allowing
       me to connect this call.

        (Now is where the most questions occur. Just explain that for some
        reason you can't connect the call in the standard manner. Remain calm
        and sound annoyed and uninterested, just like the real operator would.)

Hacker: Would you still like to accept the charges using an alternative
        billing method?

Victim: Well, how else can I pay for the call?

        (BINGO! You're almost home. Now calmly say..)

Hacker: You may use your AT&T calling card.

Victim: Hold on, Let me get it out of my purse... Here it is.

Hacker: The number please, Ma'am?

Victim: 203 297 2300 2453

Hacker: Thank you Ma'am. One moment please.

        (Here is where the conference comes in handy. Have the conference
        controller beep out of the conference for 10 seconds, then beep back
        in. Have the controller (or someone else) say:

Controller: Hello, Jane?

Victim: No, this is Marsha.

Controller: May I speak to Jane Bonehead?

Victim: This is MARSHA Bonehead.

Controller: I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

Victim: Well you just cost me a collect call, buster!

Controller: I'm sorry Ma'am.

        (This is important to make sure the lady won't be calling AT&T in the
        morning to report you. If you don't have a conference or two people
        working, just say..)

Hacker: I'm sorry, the calling party has hung up. We can only hope they'll call
        back.

Victim: Ok.

Hacker: Have a nice night, Ma'am.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

        And there you have it, a virgin AT&T.  With practice, you will be able
to get more cards than you possibly could use. Just remain calm and sound as
much like an AT&T operator as possible.


Happy Hacking,
Morrissey/Trinity!
