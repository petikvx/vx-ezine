      Since  Dark  Angel  has made his PHUNKY virus writting guides, but has
   yet to  include boot sector viruses, I decided to  take his lead.  If you
   don't know assembly well, or have never written a virus, don't start with
   boot sector viruses, as you might just confuse yourself.  I would suggest
   taking a  serious look at Dark  Angel's virus writting guides, as I could
   not do a  better job explaining them.  If you already know COM, EXE, SYS,
   and/or TSR viruses, then welcome to the next step of virus writing.

        The basic overview is:

             1>  Load new INT 13h handler into memory.
             2>  Load Partition Table for reading.
             3>  Copy it to high memory and transfer control to there.
             4>  Check to see if the HD is infected,  If so, read old
                 partition table and exit.
             5>  If it's clean, then read old boot block.
             6>  Write partition table to sector seven.
             7>  Write virus to sector one.
             8>  Return control to original boot block.


        The INT 13h Handler overview is:

             1>  Check for default drive.  If so, exit.
             2>  Check to see if it's drive A, if no disk is drive A,
                 then exit.
             3>  Call interrupt 13h.
             4>  Read partition table into boot block, after virus.
             5>  If it's not infected, infect it:
                  a> Write old boot block to head 1, sector 3.
                  b> If it's not a 360k disk, then load Eh into the CL
                     register.
                  c> Load value of CX firstsector.
                  d> Copy partition table to the end of the virus.
                  e> Write the virus to sector one.


      Boot sector viruses, like EXE files, start at origin 0. A jump is made
   to then entrance of the virus, bypassing data, and your interrupt 13  TSR
   code.  First, I shall explain the virus, then give the sample source code
   to the Sample MBR (Main Boot sectoR) Virus.

      Upon entrance, you have to load the virus just  below the stack point,
   at offset:segment  0000:7C00h.  You  have to xor a register, to clear the
   Data, and Stack  Segments. *NOTE: You  can't move segments to each other,
   so you  have to do this via registers. *  Xor (eXclusive OR), when called
   to the same  register will  clear the register. MOV AX,0 will do the same
   thing. Before you clear the Stack Segment, ALL interrupts MUST be stopped
   via the CLI command.  After which, you  restore them via STI.  Before you
   restore the interrupts, load the stack pointer  with the address that you
   need (7C00h), as the loading  point is  contained in SS:SP.  Then you may
   want to save 0000:7C00h (Again,  you can't push SS/SP up on to the stack,
   as they ARE the stack).

      Next, you have to install the new interrupt 13h code into memory. This
   will allow the virus to  infect the floppy drives.  The code that we will
   use, will overide the current interrupt 13h, but will decrease the memory
   size by  about 2k.  There  are other ways  around this, but alas, this is
   the code I  chose, as I  think  this is the  best way to  accomplish this
   task.  After this code is in place, you can simply call INT 13h normally,
   as INT 13h will  check to see  if it's called by certain  criteria (which
   will be  explained  shortly),  so just  call it like  you would any other
   program.

      To check to see if the virus has already  infected the hard drive, you
   just check 'FIRSTSECTOR', a variable I  defined which you can change, for
   the  number 7.  The  designates  that  the  partition  table is in sector
   seven, and that the hard drive has been  infected.  If not, 'FIRSTSECTOR'
   will have  the value of 3,  which means  that it is in sector 3, and is a
   floppy disk.

      Now  let's assume  that you're on a floppy drive.  What you to is read
   the old boot block, and place it into sector 3 on the floppy drive. After
   which, you  will  procede  to read the boot block on the hard disk. As to
   why  you want  to do this, it  may be  confusing.  It is  the only way to
   infect other disks, and get the hard drive  infected.  Just infecting one
   floppy  disk  isn't any  big  deal,  as they  will  only damage that disk
   (assuming that you've  added code  to wreak  havoc on their computer - By
   this  time in  your virus writting career, you  should be  an experienced
   programmer,  so I  won't get  into any  coding on  damage, or  any ideas,
   because the more original you are, the more popular  your virus is.)  But
   if you infect their HD, then any  disk that they insert will be infected,
   and you have more of a  chance to  spread your  virus to all parts of the
   world.  You  have to  first check  to see  if it is infected,  before you
   infect it.  If your not sure on how to do this,  consult the source code,
   as I commented  it so that  anyone  can  understand it.  Then after it is
   infected, return control to the original boot block at s:o 0000:7C00h.

      If your already at the HD (FIRSTSECTOR contains a 7), then you have to
   write the partition table to sector 7, (obviously you always JC to ERROR_
   HANDLER if their  may be an error), copy the  partition table information
   to  the end  of the  virus  (you have  to define  an area for it, which I
   called partitioninfo.)  Then write it to sector 8, and write the virus to
   sector 1.

      When you  originally jumped  past some coding, I told you not to worry
   about it for now.  Well, now, that's all that's left to do.  First, there
   are  three  data  definitions,  FIRSTSECTOR,  the  address  for  the  old
   interrupt 13h, and the destination for the high memory jump.  Take a look
   at the source for more details about it.

      Next, we have the interrupt 13h handler.  What that should  do, in out
   case, if  it's not  the  default  drive,  then exit.  Then,  you  have to
   determine whether or not there's a disk in drive A:.  If  there  is, then
   infect  the disk,  if not  then exit.  Assuming  there  is a  disk in the
   drive, you should call the old interrupt 13h, then infect the disk.  This
   is  called  post-execution  chaining,  as  your  code  executes after the
   original interrupt is called. Another way that you  could do it, is  pre-
   execution  chaining.  Which  would  do  it's  duty  first,  then call the
   interrupt.


      Next,  we need  to code the  infection  area of the interrupt.  First,
   clear out all of the registers, and stacks.  Redirect  the Data and Extra
   segment to the code segment, as all the data is in the coding.  Read into
   the  boot  block  after the  virus, and  continue if there is no error to
   checking the  infection.  If  there is  an error, reset the disk, and try
   again.  If there happen to be alot of errors, then just quit.

      After you determine  that the disk is  not infected, then infect it by
   the following  means (I would suggest  using  sector 3  for the partition
   table, but it isn't nessesary.  If  you do change it, however, be sure to
   change it for the WHOLE virus, otherwise you'll just get alot of  errors,
   as shown:)

     1> Write the old boot block to head 1, sector 3.
     2> Determine if it's a 360k disk, if not, move Eh into the CL
        register.
     3> Load the value of 3 into firstsector to signify a floppy disk.
     4> Copy the partition table to the end of the virus, in the des.
        area.
     5> Write the virus to sector 1.

      After that, restore the registers that you originally  pushed onto the
   stack, and return  via 'RETN'.  That's  it!  That's  all that there is to
   infecting boot  sectors.  After  the initial coding is done, you can make
   your new virus interesting by having some side effects, like displaying a
   message every so often,  or not working on  certain days.  The quality of
   your  virus is  only limited  to your  imagination!  Now, for  the source
   code:

      So now you have it.  You should be able  to go and  write  boot sector
   viruses,  without  fucking  up THAT  much.  It  does  take  practice, but
   practice makes perfect (well, sort of).  Go  now, you can't just sit here
   and read  everything  you  find, you  have  to  actually DO it, to become
   successfull.  This  virus is based on the  Michaelangelo virus, with some
   modifications such as I ripped out the bomb, slightly modified it for the
   mag, and added comments to it.
