                             Trinity Gets Busted!
                             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


      The first 'bust'  happened with 2 members, and a wanna-be hacker.  The
   situation took  place sometime in January of 1993.  This wanna-be hacker,
   which I'll call 'Jeremy', asked another hacker for a code to use, to dial
   an alliance.  That  hacker decided to  give  Jeremy a code to use (Why? I
   don't know, probably because they're friends).  So, he decides to call up
   the alliance, and dial the home numbers of Misguided Youth and Flatliner.

      As a general  rule, we always had  thought that  alliances are safe to
   have  someone call your number, because  your only picking  up the phone,
   and could just say  that you did not  know that the  call was an  illegal
   call. I might add that Flatliner had Jeremy call some of his out-of-state
   friends  through the alliance.  I was  away on  vacation when  this whole
   thing took place, so I had nothing to do with it.

      After about a few months, Flatliner  recieved a call on his line, with
   some guy trying to get  his name, and address.  When he told me about it,
   and about  the alliance, I  thought nothing of it,  that it's just merely
   some lamer trying  to pull something, but  when this guy called back with
   all of Flatliners info, he got a little worried.  The same thing happened
   to Misguided Youth.

      In both cases, the caller  said he was an  owner of the  alliance, and
   that someone illegally used a code to call it, so  that they wouldn't get
   billed, and they (FL & MY) were among the list of people the 'hacker' had
   called  through a  telephone  service (code).   Then, a bill was  sent to
   Misguided  Youth for $20, and to Flatliner for $150 (For his calls to his
   friends).  (* HTC's Note: At this point, when they both tell me this, I'm
   on the floor laughing my ass off! They weren't so - enthused *) Flatliner
   showed it to his  mom, and she was  kinda, shall we say - pissed off - at
   him for being apart of  this whole disarray  of events.  Needless to say,
   neither one of  them (FL & MY) ever even  thought of paying for the bill,
   and nothing else happened about that incident.

Tragic Flaw: None, except ever doing ANYTHING with 'Jeremy'.

Ending Point: Laughter (FL Lightened up, after a while) and experience.

Result: Nothing COULD happend to them, here's why:

      What did they do that was illegal, answer the phone? If that is wrong,
   then we all have something to worry about.  Just a word of caution;  Some
   alliances do tape all  conversations, so be careful about what you say on
   there.  You never know who's listening.

      The second bust was  actually a real bust, and it did  NOT turn out so
   hillarious.  Terminal Silicosis was  scanning one day (a part of our 6 or
   so  recent scans of the area) and when  he  was done  commenting them, he
   dialed up a DEC Server that he found.  It was un-passworded, and even had
   dialout  capabilities!  He  dialed a local number,  and found out that it
   worked. After this, he gave it to the other members.  Luckily for me, the
   number was  long distance, and so I never called  it.  It  was fine for a
   while, except  for the 20,000 lamers  asking  about it, so  we gave it to
   them.  Little did we know, because of all the lamers sitting on there for
   four hours  straight  while  connected to  Florida, it alerted the admin-
   istrator, and s/he had a trace put on the line.  Terminal Silicosis still
   was  using this  number,  while the rest of us, for  some reason, had not
   called it back.  I  must mention that TS was a month away from turning 18
   when the  trace was put on.   When we all  got pissed  off at  the lamers
   leaving 10+  messages a day on  our voice mail's, we made up a story that
   the  DEC Server  had a trace on it, and TS was in  deep trouble.  Nothing
   like foreshadowing, eh?   When the administrator called up TS, and he was
   brought  down to the local  police  station, After being interregated for
   many hours he said that he gave the number out to the lamers, AND some of
   the group members.  I have to mention here, that we all made an agreement
   that if either one of us got in trouble with the law, we'd keep the blame
   on ourselves, and save the group.  Terminal Siliconvict came up with that
   one. But why did he tell them that he gave it to some of us, and not just
   the lamers? I don't have a definate answer to that one.

Tragic Flaw: Giving the number to the lamers, and for TS - telling the cops
             that he gave the number to some of us.

Ending Point: A trial yet to be had, and TS leaving Trinity (Group decision)

Result: TS is fucked, and some of us are laying low for a while.

      The third incident happened just to me, and I don't think anything big
   will  happen to me, if  anything  at all.  I'm  changing  the name of the
   company, and  other related info, because they're still investigating the
   issue, and if they know  I'm a hacker, they'll try to bust me, instead of
   dropping the case because I DIDN'T FUCKING DO IT!

      One day, when I came home from school,  my brother confronted me about
   something  that I might  have done.  I  told him I  didn't  do it, and he
   showed me the  number of the accusee.  I called this loser up, to get the
   company name, and  when she/he/it (I couldn't tell) answered, I just hung
   up.  My dad came home a  little while later, and I told him about it.  He
   called him up, and the dork explained it to him. What was the accusation?
   He said that I  called up his - 800 - number, and  hacked  into it, while
   deleting  his hard  drive on some  Saturday  morning. (He did give me the
   date, but ...)

      When my dad  got off the phone, I was kinda worried, because I thought
   the guy was refering to my 800 voice mail that I 'borrowed', oh ok, fine,
   so I stole the fucking thing, ok? I then did a DA on the company, and the
   number was NOT a  number that I ever called before (I have a photographic
   memory, so I KNOW I didn't call the bastard).

      This would be  impossible  for me to  hack  into it anyway, because my
   parents  took my computer away, and the have theirs in their room, and if
   I even open  up the door, my mom would awake (she's a LIGHT sleeper).  It
   also  would be very  stupid, as all 800  numbers have  your number on the
   bill, so if he had the time (which he did) he would know who called. This
   case is still pending further investigation, so I will keep you updated.

Tragic Flaw: None, I DIDN'T DO IT!

Ending Point: Hasn't happened yet.

Result: N/A

        Lamer report!   During  the last  few  weeks,  some  lamer  has been
    scanning an exchange in  Wethersfield Conneticut, and came across a Sign
    Control  Station.  He 'hacked' into it via the help command, and changed
    the highway signs to Anti-Weicker (Our  governor) sayings. It would have
    been ok, but when the local boys found out, they put a trace on the line
    hoping that the guy would call back.  He did, thus being busted.

        Another person,  thinking he could get away with it, pulled the same
    stunt, and HE got busted too.  IF YOU HACK INTO A COMPUTER, AND THERE IS
    THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE  OF BEING BUSTED, DON'T CALL BACK!!!  The lamers at
    the (govmt) computer couldn't even figure out how to fix the signs (They
    checked the manual, and eventually they fixed it).

Tragic Flaw: Calling Back!

Ending Point: 2 Dorks in Jail

Result: This article, and a few good laughs (Not worth the trouble)
