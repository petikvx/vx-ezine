                    The Ten Commandments of The Trinity

1.)  THOU SHALT WRITE THINE OWN CODE.
        There is no art in copying.  Learn from others, but be 
        original.

2.)  THOU SHALT NOT WRITE DESTRUCTIVE CODE. 
        Create Art, Not Weaponry.

3.)  THOU SHALT NOT PROGRAM OVERWRITING VIRUSES.
        Virons suck.  Write real code.

4.)  THOU SHALT WRITE TIGHT CODE.
        Sloppy programming makes me PuKE.  Programming is an art,
        treat it as such.

5.)  THOU SHALT BE CREATIVE AT ALL TIMES.
        Writing useless code that looks like it was mass generated 
        is boring and stupid.  Either write something interesting, or
        don't write.

6.)  THOU SHALT NOT RELEASE VIRUSES ON THE PUBLIC.
        What's the point?  Code for the challenge and the skill,
        not to screw with ignorant users.

7.)  THOU SHALT NOT DEAL WITH ARiSToTLe.
        Some things are just better left undone.

8.)  THOU SHALT FIGHT FOR THINE RIGHTS.
        Freedom is important.  Information is important.  Fight to
        keep information, and yourself, free.

9.)  THOU SHALT ENCOURAGE THE LEARNING OF THINE ART.
        Be free with information, and teach those that desire to learn.

10.) THOU SHALT CONTINUE EXPLORING AND LEARNING UNTIL THE END OF THINE TIME.
       If you aren't learning something, and you aren't doing something
       new, don't bother.
