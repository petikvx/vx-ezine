"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
								Genesis 1:1

					   An Introduction to The Trinity

		Well, I guess it's always good to start at the beginning.  
In the beginning....  hmmmm. Where was the beginning of this whole mess?  
A telephone call.  A Sunday night.  An angry parent.  My friend got a call 
from his roommate's mother yelling about what a bad influence he was on her 
son and how conceited he was and how my friend thought himself a math god.  
Well, this last quote slowly transformed into just "god".  So since this 
guy's mother had to be right (not) my friend became God, as a fun in-joke.  
Well, it came around that there were three people who wanted to start a virus 
writing group, and since one person was already "God" (in joke only, not as 
a handle) they decided on The Trinity as a label.  Thus were born God, Jesus, 
and the Holy Spirit.  Not too long after, two people who were knowledgeable 
on how the computer underground worked, besides being friends of the original 
three, joined on.  These two, keeping with the theme, became Moses and Noah.  
About a week ago, we had our first group meeting.  The three coders each had 
something in the works already, so we decided that a joint release along with 
an introduction to the members could be released in one magazine and give us 
a starting point, along with a common goal.  Well, we decided on a deadline 
and, of course, we're all working on it the night before said deadline.  
This tells you a little about the group, I might be able to pull off profiles 
of the members, but it _is_ 1:40 in the morning, so I'm only doing my best.


Let's see :

God : I've known this guy for about 5 years, and I've seen him go all the 
way from pascal to cutting-edge assembly code.  His first virus for the group 
was designed for my roommate, a guy with close to 200 megs of gifs on his 
hard drive.  God is one of the coders for the group, and is well versed in 
assembly, C, and pascal. although he rarely goes for high-level stuff 
anymore.  He is a Math major, enjoys Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd (yes, he has 
a ticket to the concert), and has decided that having a generous girlfriend 
with a car is much better than having a car yourself.

Jesus : I don't know much about him, except he's a really good assembly
programmer.  He plays the Bass Guitar, has exceptionally long hair (thus
the handle he chose), and is the only person I've seen recently pay for a
pizza, eat a quarter, give half away, then throw away a quarter.

Holy Spirit : Due to this lengthy handle, he has chosen the truncated
H_Spirit.  H_Spirit is a very likable guy, even though he claims to hold
95% of the world in contempt.  He just learned assembly 3 months ago, and
already has a nice virus.  Not bad.  He is now proficient in C and
assembly, and also has tickets to see Pink Floyd (don't you hate these
people!).

Moses : The first of two non-programmers in the group.  He does a lot of
the graphics and music for the group.  He was one of the people on the
original InterChat, and plans to eventually learn assembly.

Noah : I am the second of the non-programmers.  I do whatever is left over
that doesn't require any assembly knowledge, like writing introduction
profiles.  Eventually, I plan to learn assembly as well.
