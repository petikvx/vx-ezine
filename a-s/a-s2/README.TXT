"I just downloaded Issue 2 <or later> but all I get is a .DAT file, why?"
          
	Very simply, Anti-Social is in .EXE format but the magazine is all
in the .DAT file.   As a result the 2 .EXE files used to view the magazine
can be separated and re-used with any issue so you need only get them once, 
this is in order to reduce peoples download times of future issues once they 
have the .EXE files.  The 2 .EXE files are available in Issue 1 of the 
magazine, or separately in a .ZIP file, both of which can be found at 
Anti-Social's web site:

if you still have problems getting the .EXE files (A-S.exe, Register.exe)
then simply email me ARMAGEDDON at:  Khorne@compuserve.com

Any other questions or comments should also be sent to the above address.
