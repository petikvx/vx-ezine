			Infection INF file part II
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This continuation of articles published in MATRiX E-ZiNE #1. After release of 
a ezine  to  me very  many  letters(mail) in which have come were  source INF 
of viruses of ideas on infection etc.. I have decided to continue this  theme 
to tell on more detailed the theory of infection...


 % Introduction %
 ****************

 Many likely know that such INF files if is not present, look e-zine MATRiX#1 
 or open the  catalogue  windows\inf,  you will  see many  these filez. I can 
 shortly tell that it script files which are very necessary to system windoze.

 In May of this year I have decided (solved) again to engage INF in files and 
 to write parasite inf  infector and in some hours I has  understood as it to 
 write. Infection INF easily to write for this purpose it is necessary to use 
 Debug Script.

 Method of  infection which I shall describe in this articles approaches both 
 for DOS and for Windows of viruses it(he) is universal...

 
 % Infection %
 *************

 þ For Dos of viruses we will need to search for section [DefaultInstall]  if 
   her(it) is not present that  to create and to write down there  parameter:
   UpdateAutoBat =  Patch.It ÄÄÄÄ  This  parameter  writes  down  teams  in 
   autoexec.bat which the user in INF a file has specified...
   After that we create below section [Patch.it] and we write down parameters
   which should write down in autoexec.bat. 
    
   Exemple 

   [DefaultInstall] 
   UpdateAutoBat = Patch.It ; record in autoexec.bat in section Patch.it 

   [Patch.it]             ; patch autoexec.bat 
    
   CmdAdd = "@ctty", "nul" 
   CmdAdd = "echo", "here u virus debug script "
   CmdAdd = "echo", "here u virus debug script " 
   Ä Here there should be teams which will transform debug 
       script in EXE/COM file
   CmdAdd = "ctty", "con"

    
   All the algorithm of infection is very simple.. Most important: the teams 
   which enter the name in autoexec.bat should go through a point exemple :
  "echo", "Matrix kewl"

   Then if you want to write stealth that to you it is required to register 
   once  again virus only  to  replace  CmdAdd on CmdDelete. What  for it is 
   necessary?  It  is  necessary  that  after  performance  of  a  code  in 
   autoexec.bat it(he) automatically left..

 þ Windoze

   To us for infection under Windoze it to be necessary API: 
   WritePrivateProfileStringA - For record in INF files 
   WinExec or CreateProcessA - For exec of a file Autoexec.bat 

   Under Windows we not need search of section in INF files we can them to 
   write down or if they are to add virus parameters it simplifies infection.

   After we have infected INF a file to us it will be necessary to check on
   presence  dropperz  in  autoexec.bat if it(he)  there is  that  to  start 
   drooperz... 


 % Last Word %
 ************* 

  The infection  INF of files will be  depends on your  ideas as you want to 
  write it... In this clause I simply have described the theory of infection 
  and you  already think as you  it to  make if you  want can look at mine a 
  virus INFerno  published in a e-zine  Top Device,  there will see detailed 
  infection INF of files under DOS.

  Good luck in a spelling of new technological viruses... 

  HeNKy: script & asm = kewl...
