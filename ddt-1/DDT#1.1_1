 At last you can read  this magazine, the  first one that  the spanish  virus
 writers  group DDT ViRUS STUDiOS (shortened to DDT) publishes. Well,  we can
 say you  that our lifes, when making  stuff for this magazine  were a fucked
 living hell. DDT is  formed by very young  virus coders, working for get our
 own place in the scene. Btw, we are living at this moment a crisis in the VX
 scene: authors leaving, web sites  are getting down, FBI is catching some of
 our partners and  making publicity of it, the "freedom of speech" concept is
 being erased from the internet, AV  companies are earning tons of money with
 all those scandals, i have been personally defamated publically...

 Formed in late 1997, DDT is  here and ready to rock. The first step was made
 by the publication of this magazine, but we won't stop here :) Our group has
 a defined  hierarchy, where the main  redactor is myself, Billy Belceb£, and
 followed by zAxOn as my right hand, all the  another DDT members. Anyway all
 our decisions are made voting... ;) We are members of the Feathered Serpents
 Alliance (FSA). If  you want  more  information  about  that  just go to the
 Feathered Serpents' home  page, in http://fly.to/serpents.org , or read  the
 information about what the Alliance means in this same magazine.

 It's time  to take a look to the future... Well, maybe you're surprised that
 in this zine will be  DOS viruses... Yep, but  note that  some of  them were
 written  some  time ago, but  we're now  working for make  some more Windows
 viruses, that seem  to be the  future of virus writing. Since 1995, the time
 were VLAD were  rocking around and  surprising the  whole world with Bizatch
 (look Bontchy! B I Z A T C H !!!), a new breath  passed through the, at that
 time, obsolete virus scene, with a new platform for  infect, and then making
 the people to have a second chance in  the past-frustrated tries to innovate
 in something... New  unexplored lands, a new realm for discover... And wait-
 ing for all us. So let's join together to that party :)

 And please, forgive us for all the misspells that we could make through this
 magazine, coz our mother tongue ain't english. And when reading this magazi-
 ne, you must think  that this  is our  first step in the scene (we hope that
 it won't be the last :P). And remember... The higher you are, the harder you
 fall. 

 Btw, as  i heard  a lot of times the same thing "What the fuck DDT handles?"
 and such like, i realized  that i have  to teach  all  you some chemistry :)                       
           CCl^3        This is  the  Dichlore Diphenyl  Trichloretane (well,
 /----\    |     /----\ i'm not 100% sure  that it's the right translation to
 | Cl |--- CH ---| Cl | english), and i  think that you know what that was...
 \----/          \----/ No? DDT was an pesticide highly  used in  the 50-60's
                        At that time, the DDT was legal, and besides, the ppl
 thought that it hasn't bad effects for humans, only for insects and plagues.
 But after that they  found that it had  several consequences to  the nature,
 mostly because some plagues  developed a way to  defend theirselves againist
 DDT, meanwhile their natural  predators didn't, so  the plagues could grow a
 lot. Then, the DDT lost  its usage, except  in  the cases of extreme need to
 kill a  determinated  plague in  a determinated country. But this is another
 history. The DDT saved MILLIONS of people, for example, in the India, almost
 exterminating the malaria disease.                .___________.
                                                 .:|VIVA EL CHE|:.
 For  what things we fight? Yep, as you $$$$$$$$$&""""~        ~"?&$$$$$$$$$$
 can think reading this magazine, we go $$$$$$$"'   ___,,,,,,___   "$$$$$$$$$
 againist all kinds of fascisms, and da $$$$$$$     """""$$&&&&&&  ,$$$$$$$$$
 hipocrisy... But  it's  hard  to fight $$$$&"~    +&&$$_&$&$&&$$   ""$$$$$$$
 with the system, so we only contribute $$$$&        }&-.&&&$$$$'     &$$$$$$
 with the thing we know to do: make vi- $$$$$&,        ,$$$&&&&^    + $$$$$$$
 ruses. We (all the VXers) are ussually $$$$$$\&_`      ~^^^_/   __ _$$$$$$$$
 labeled  as  data killers, terrorists, """"""""""                 """"""""""
 and some more things like that, but it's only because their lack of knowled-
 ge of what a virus is, because  their ignorance. At Friday 13 or 5th January
 we must  hear always  the same shit... "All  the computers will be infected,
 and all the data will be destroyed" or "Don't turn on the computer until to-
 morrow"... But  there's always, after this shit, an AVer saying that all the
 problems gone  with the  product he's  trying to  sell  us... "This software
 detects  100% of old and new viruses". Of course all the lamers go fastly to
 a shop for buy the shit... Almost  all times that AV is a shit, and the user
 lives happily without knowing da truth. That is our society too, but this is
 another history. The lameness arrives some times until places that you can't
 think... Like the  day Friday 13, November 1998, when  Billy had to hear the
 comment of the guy that it's at his rigth, in his attempt to demonstrate his
 intelligence, said that viruses  travelled by the electric net (hey! explain
 me how to do that! :''''''DDDDDDDD ), and when he saw  me laughing a lot, he
 tried to  explain me that viruses could  appear "magically" in the computer,
 and after they go away... :') Well, see what ignorance does (and what a good
 marketing of an AV enterprise do).

 We sincerely  hope that you will enjoy  this e-zine at  least as we  enjoyed
 when writing it. As you can see, we orienter many information to educational
 purposes in the research fields  related to the "new" (relatively new) plat-
 forms, as Win32. We won't tolerate anymore that excuses, such "Windows codin
 is too difficult for me", because it  is not. In this magazine we  wanted to
 have many little and easily understandable tutorials  about some matters re-
 lated to virus  coding under Win32, but without forget  the content targeted
 to people that is  beginning to be interested in  virus coding. So, this mag
 is for all the family. Hrmm, sure? No... PARENTAL ADVISORY: EXPLICIT CONTENT

 Here in DDT we support all the freedom of speech campaigns over the net (you
 have an example in the Blue Ribbon's one), and of course, the freedom at all
 without  forget that we  accept critics to our job. Of course, if the critic
 you have is something like "You are a motherfucker", "That is shit" or some-
 thing alike, you'll probably have  a reply in form of a mail bombin or some-
 thing  cruel... We expect  the "Constructive Criticism" of  all you, doesn't
 matter what you think, if it's good or bad, about us.

 This is the first  thing of DDT being a  group you can have. We worked a lot
 since October/November 1998, when zAxOn and me decided that the next step to
 do in the group was to make  a magazine. Since then, we have been contacting
 with many  people for contributions, some  members joined  us, some left, we
 appeared in  the media, and, of  course, we have  written  viruses. This is,
 nowadays, our  humble contribution to the virus scene. Many things have cha-
 nged in the  virus scene  since Phalcon/Skism  times, many legendary  groups
 born, many died, but the  scene had been always growing. The virus scene is,
 as Winter said, much more  compact that the other ones  in the  underground,
 the dark side  of the computing. Things change  in the  scene, but  what the
 people think about us  outside is much more  different. They generally think
 that we are kids with needs of fame, with the only target to destroy other's
 data, and the AV  scene is  the  savior. Same lies  than  always, the fierce
 capitalism strikes  again, the  marketing of AV companies, as i said before.
 Create life, as  we do, must be seen as an art, as an expression of what can
 do a clever mind. What's the difference  between create  a  virus and create
 a human life? While creating a  virus we can experiment many different feel-
 ings: happyness when  something works, impotence and  madness when something
 doesn't... Create a human  life is  matter of 2 seconds of absolute pleasure
 followed by many headaches, nights without sleep, many things you should pay
 and such like. Resuming, virus writing  must not be seen as a terrorist act,
 it must be see as an  expresion of what human intelligence could do, and not
 as a "natural-thing-that-could-occur-with-luck".

 Btw, we have our sentence (Copyright by zAxOn/DDT) : "Think, Act, Innovate".
 Well, for close this article i must comment that you have entered in a world
 in that  escape is almost impossible. You have  just fallen in  the net that
 virus  writing is. You social life (?) and the rest of things of your "real"
 life will go hell. But you'll  feel the power  of control the OS, this thing
 that  Micro$oft wants to use for  control us... Remember what i am saying...

 Hrm... Now i'm gonna tell  you a little  story. In this  magazine we had for
 many  months the best Win95  virus ever, the  best Ring-0  virus  ever (guys
 involved know of what virus i am talking about), and fuck, we haven't publi-
 shed it. Pfffff, ain't  the author copyright the  reason. Is the  friendship
 with another guy that received directly from the author that virus. I'm per-
 sonally very angry with the world, with my luck, and with all with two legs,
 two arms  and a head. We were  going to publish that  jewel, and finally  we
 couldn't. I feel impotent. Bah. This is  the second time that this passes in
 this  magazine. The first time, we had  a very very cool  virus, and another
 famous magazine  published it before. Ok, i accepted it. We received another
 jewel, even more  good, and happened again, another magazine is going to pu-
 blish  it, with  author's  permission. What should i do?  What should we do?
 This situation is making me go crazy. I'd like to scream  to the world a big
 'FUCK YOU ALL', but i know i can't do it. Shit...

 Heh, the worldz situation  now is crazy: in the  scene and  outside  it. For
 example, i have  been (and i am) away from  the scene, but i heard about the
 departure  of some  of  the best coders of our group-brother 29A, Vecna  and
 Z0MBiE, TI released their  first e-zine, FSA continues growing, iKX and SLAM
 are working hard  in their respectives next  issues, and some viruses are in
 the media  almost every time like  Melissa, Happy99  and  the  classic  CIH.
 And now some  questions can be  raised... Who  is WM.Melissa author? Why the
 United States  are so fascist? Why a  silly macro virus  can spread as fast?
 About the world, as most  of you know there is a  war between Serbia and the
 members of the NATO, and btw, i hate wars. But this is a virus magazine, not
 a political one (this suckers shouldn't exist).

 After my words about almost all the  themes i am able to think about, i will
 let you  enjoy of  one of  the best e-zines you have  ever read (heh... just
 kidding!), ehrm... almost ;) No, no, i think it  has some interesting things
 for all people, beginners, advanced and  gurus in  the  VX  world. I have to
 thank (again) to all  the people that made  this e-zine to be a reality, and
 make our dream reality: to have an e-zine with some quality. (Heh, no, no...
 I'm not under the influence of any drug! I'm still modest ;) )
