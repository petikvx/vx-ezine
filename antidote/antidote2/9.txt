0.01 --=\\What?\\=--

     What is 'Antidote'? Well, we wouldn't say that Antidote is a hacking magazine, cause
     that would be wrong. We don't claim to be a hacking magazine. All Antidote is, is
     basically current news and happenings in the underground world. We aren't going to
     teach you how to hack or anything, but we will supply you with the current information
     and exploits. Mainly Antidote is just a magazine for people to read if they have some
     extra time on there hands and are bored with nothing to do. If you want to read a maga-
     zine that teaches you how to hack etc, then you might want to go to your local book-
     store and see if they carry '2600'.

   ------------------------------


0.02 --=\\FAQ\\=--

     Here are a lot of questions that we seem to recieve a lot, or our "Frequently Asked
     Questions". Please read this before e-mailing us with questions and if the question
     isn't on here or doesn't make sense, then you can e-mail us with your question.
 
     > What exactly is "Antidote"?
       See section 0.01 for a complete description.	
	
     > I find Antidote to not be shot for the beginner or does not teach you the basics,
       why is that?
       Antidote is for everyone, all we are basically is a news ezine that comes out once
       a week with the current news, exploits, flaws and even programming. All of the
       articles that are in here are recieved second hand (sent to us) and we very rarely
       edit anyone's articles.

     > I just found Antidote issues on your webpage, is there anyway I can get them sent
       to me through e-mail?
       Yes, if you go to www.thepoison.org/antidote there should be a text box where you can
       input your e-mail address. You will recieve a link to the current Antidote (where you
       can view it).

     > If I want to submit something, are there any 'rules'?
       Please see section 0.03 for a complete description.
	
     > If I submitted something, can I remain anonymous?
       Yes. Just make sure that you specify what information about yourself you would like
       to be published above your article (when sending it to us) and we will do what you
       say.

     > I submitted something and I didn't see it in the current/last issue, why is that?
       It could be that someone else wrote something similar to what you wrote and they sent
       it to us first. If you sent us something and we didn't e-mail you back, then you
       might want to send it again because we probably didn't get it (we respond to all e-
       mails no matter what). We might use your article in future issues off Antidote.

     > Can I submit something that I didn't "discover" or "write"?
       Yes you can, we take information that is written by anyone regardless if you wrote it
       or not.

     Well thats it for our FAQ. If you have a question that is not on here or the question
     is on here and you had trouble understanding it, then please feel free to e-mail
     lordoak@thepoison.org and he will answer your question. This FAQ will probably be
     updated every month.

   ------------------------------


0.04 --=\\Writing\\=--

     As many of you know, we are always open to articles/submittings. We will take almost
     anything that has to do with computer security. This leaves you open for:

         -Protecting the system (security/securing)
         -Attacking the system (hacking, exploits, flaws, etc....)
         -UNIX (really anything to do with it...)
         -News that has to do with any of the above....

     The only thing that we really don't take is webpage hacks, like e-mailing us and saying
     "www.xxx.com" was hacked... But if you have an opinion about the hacks that is fine. If
     you have any questions about what is "acceptable" and not, please feel free to e-mail
     Lord Oak [lordoak@thepoison.org] with your question and he will answer it. Also, please
     note that if we recieve two e-mails with the same topic/idea then we will use the one
     that we recieved first. So it might be a good idea to e-mail one of us and ask us if
     someone has written about/on this topic so that way you don't waste your time on
     writing something that won't be published. An example of this would be:

	If Joe sends me an e-mail with the topic being on hacking hotmail accounts on
	thursday.
	And then Bill sends us an e-mail on hacking hotmail accounts on sunday, we will
	take Joe's article because he sent it in first.

     But keep in mind, we might use your article for the next issue! If you have something
     that you would like to submit to Antidote, please e-mail lordoak@thepoison.org or
     duece@thepoison.org  and one of us will review the article and put it in Antidote (if
     we like it).

1.01 --=\\AntiOnline Under Investigation\\=--

     June 10, 1999
     Brian Martin - Founder of ATTRITION

     Today, Attrition staff learned that the FBI have opened investigations into
     John Vranesevich and AntiOnline. Trusted sources close to the investigation
     would not comment on the depth or details, but one agent would state "it
     has been going on longer than you think".

     When asked if Vranesevich's recent "change of mission" was in any way related
     to the investigation, the agent only replied "no comment at this time." 

     The timing of this investigation coincides with AntiOnline's change of heart
     regarding hacker activity and law enforcement. After a shocking change of
     mission statement in which Vranesevich practically admits to crime, he pledges 
     to help law enforcement by "helping to serve, even if in some very small way."

     Vranesevich goes on to say "I have been watching you these past 5 years. I 
     know how you do the things you do, why you do the things you do, and I know 
     who you are." This ominous threat was not received well by the hacker 
     community. A hacker called "h4r1k1r1" said "JP's 'contribution' to the
     hacker community has been little more than creating FUD, and promoting 
     the puerile ideals of script kiddies worldwide."

     One staff member from Attrition going by Punkis reminded us of the now
     prophetic words from Vranesevich, who said "I could make just as much, if 
     not more money, by hunting down hackers and turning them in." These words
     were said by Vranesevich on April 5th of this year.

1.02 --=\\Hacking No longer a Prank\\=--

     [www.msnbc.com]

     IN THIS DIGITAL AGE, your company whether it be an Amazon, E-Trade or some idea still
     forming is built on a brand, a process and an information infrastructure. The way your
     site appears on the Web; the process by which a Web visitor can maneuver and buy pro-
     ducts; and the ability of your site to scale, connect to suppliers and customers, and
     securely maintain a digital relation will determine your success.

     Sites that scale and allow you to shop comfortably in a digital store can quickly
     extend their brands from books to auctions to pet foods and beyond.

     Sites that crumble while you and the rest of the panicked investment community try to
     bail out on a stock will find themselves abandoned and facing a new realm of legal
     liabilities. Hacked sites visibly and fundamentally shake the faith in the brand and
     the products being offered at the digital storefront.

     This loss of faith in the brand carries over to and is magnified in the government
     realm. Internet access is on the verge of becoming sufficiently ubiquitous to allow
     organizational functions to move to the Web.

     If the first big thing the Web allowed was personal access and community building from
     the ground up, the next big thing is allowing existing organizations to use the Web to
     assume previously cumbersome functions. Vote on the Web? Sure. Register your car via
     the Web. File your taxes. Get your refund. All these functions are certainly possible.

     What is missing is trust. Trust is a difficult dimension to describe, but it most
     clearly is apparent in its absence. Don’t ask a citizenry to register to vote via the
     Web if the government’s top legal agencies can’t keep their home pages free from
     graffiti.

     And it is the trust that is shaken when the White House site is hacked. Or the FBI site
     Or the Senate site. Hacking is more than breaking a few minor laws. Hacking is certain-
     ly not just being a good digital citizen by showing the security gaps that now exist to
     prevent more serious transgressions in the future.

     Hacking is neither clever nor funny, nor something to be tossed off as adolescent humor
     from sci-fi-addled minds. Hacking retards the growth of a Web-accessible government and
     should hold penalties proportional to the crime.

1.03 --=\\Deadly Worm on the Run\\=--

     [www.abcnews.go.com]

     A new and very destructive computer worm, distributed much the same way as the Melissa
     virus, is quickly spreading throughout computers in the United States. Hundreds, if not
     thousands, of machines have already been infected.

     According to anti-virus experts, the Worm.Explorer.Zip virus first started in Israel on
     or about Sunday, spreading quickly to Europe. It was first reported in the United
     States on Tuesday, with the bulk of reports coming in today.

     If you see this window, you may already have the new worm virus. The worm then proceeds
     to copy itself to the system directory with the filename Explore.exe and begins to
     harvest e-mail addresses in order to propagate itself. (ABCNEWS.com)
 
     This worm is designed to spread from network to network very quickly, says Carey
     Nachenberg, chief researcher at Symantec Corp.’s Anti-Virus Research Center. This has
     already affected thousands of machines overseas.

     How It Works
     The virus primarily affects users of Microsoft’s Outlook e-mail program, though any e-
     mail user who receives a tainted message could be in trouble. The worm enters a target
     computer through an e-mail that appears to have come from someone the user e-mailed
     before. It comes with a file attachment called zipped_files.exe. The text of the e-mail
     customarily reads:

     Hi [Recipient Name]! I received your email and I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till
     then, take a look at the attached zipped docs. Bye

     If a user then clicks to open that file, the worm is activated. It proceeds to randomly
     destroy certain files on the target computer, then replicates itself through the e-mail
     addresses in the in box.

     This doesn’t work through Microsoft Word like Melissa did, and it has the potential to
     spread far more rapidly, Nachenberg says.

     Officials with the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) at Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
     sity in Pittsburgh have yet to figure out whether the lost data can be recovered. 

     Reports Continue to Come In
     At least six different major corporations in the United States have reported the virus
     to Symantec. CERT technical staffer Mark Zajicek says at least 20 first-hand reports
     have been logged by his team, along with many second-hand reports of even more damage. 
     We have no idea when this will drop off, Zajicek says. It’s safe to say that thousands
     of users have been affected.

     A spokeswoman for Microsoft Corp. confirmed that the company shut down its outside e-
     mail this morning in order to update anti-virus and contain any outbreaks on its
     Redmond, Wash., campus. The company is also planning to post letters to its Outlook
     customers on how to combat the virus. 

     How to Stop It
     The easiest thing to do to stop the worm is for computer users to be aware of it so
     that they won’t click on the zipped_files.exe icon to activate it. Nachenberg says that
     although corporate users are far more likely to become infected by the worm, Outlook
     users have learned safe computing practices from the Melissa scare, and may halt the
     spread of the worm before it causes major damage.

     I think many corporations did a good job of educating their users about safe computing,
     Nachenberg says. Hopefully this won’t spread as far as the Melissa virus. 
     Users who see the virus in their in boxes should leave the attachment alone, delete the
     e-mail, and let their system administrators know about the infection immediately. Anti-
     virus software should also be used. Symantec Corp. and other anti-virus software
     vendors already have patches on their Web sites.

1.04 --=\\US Sentate Cracked AGAIN\\=--

    [www.wired.com]

     For the second time in two weeks, crackers on Friday defaced the Web page of the US
     Senate.

     The official Senate Web site was down as of Friday afternoon while administrators
     repaired and restored the network. A cracker replaced the official page with one that
     said "free Kevin Mitnick, free Zyklon." 

     An employee of US Senate Technical Operations said the site went down around 4 p.m. EST
     but couldn't say when the site might come back up. 

     "Those of us who haven't been hacked yet are just trying to lay low and beef up secur-
     ity as we can," said Sean Donelan, a network engineer for Data Research Associates, a
     nationwide Internet service provider that works with state governments, libraries, and
     schools. 

     Donelan said that each government agency is having to reinforce security independently
     and that outside vendors working with the government departments consider their secur-
     ity solutions proprietary. 

     "[We] are also trying not attract attention and not waving a red flag challenging
     anyone to 'test' our security," Donelan said. 

     The Senate home page was previously cracked on 27 May. In that incident, crackers
     filled the page with comments critical of the FBI. That hack was claimed by the group
     Masters of Downloading, who broadcast the message "MAST3RZ 0F D0WNL0ADING, GL0B4L
     D0MIN8T10N '99!" on the Senate's site. 

     The Varna Hacking Group claimed responsibility for the latest Web vandalism. The organ-
     ization claims it is a "noncommercial hacking group." Varna is based in Bulgaria,
     according to reports of a 1998 attack that members claimed to have launched against the
     Cartoon Network. 

     Zyklon, mentioned in Friday's incident, is alleged to be a 19-year-old hacker from
     Shoreline, Washington. He was indicted in early May for his alleged involvement in
     other government site hacks. 

     Many of the recent hacks demanded justice for imprisoned cracker Kevin Mitnick, who has
     been in jail for more than four years awaiting trial on a broad swath of criminal
     charges.

1.05 --=\\Voting Mouse\\=--

     [www.usnews.com]

     You can already bank, buy, and bar gain on the Internet. Even pay your taxes. What's
     next? Voting. At least if some Louisiana politicians have their way.

     The Louisiana Republican Party late last week was set to allow registered GOP voters to
     cast their ballots via computer in the Jan. 29, 2000, presidential caucus. "What this
     does is create thousands of polling places that never existed before," says Carey
     Holliday, an attorney and member of a GOP advisory panel that voted, 5 to 2, to endorse
     the use of Internet voting. After all, voters need only plunk down and switch on their
     computer, tap a few keys, and civic duty accomplished.

     Several legislatures are also consider ing allowing computer voting in statewide
     elections. A pilot Pentagon program will allow residents of Florida, Missouri, South
     Carolina, Texas, and Utah living abroad to vote over the Web next year.

     In Louisiana, Republicans hope the move will push up voter turnout, which hovered at
     an anemic 5 percent in the state's last presidential caucus in 1996. "It's been a big
     problem for us," says Rep. Chuck McMains. "I think this could be a great opportunity
     for people to par ticipate and, in the process, get better representation."

     Party officials blamed the abysmal show ing on a lack of polling places. Recent studies
     by VoteHere.Net

     the software com pany that developed the voting system Louisiana Republicans are
     considering show computer balloting would be em braced by 76 percent of voters ages 18
     to 30 and by 50 percent of voters over age 50. What effect this would have on who wins
     the elections is anybody's guess.

     Hacker fraud. It sounds simple enough. Yet not everyone is convinced. Critics' major
     concern: the potential for abuse. But VoteHere.Net says its program is one of the
     toughest for hackers to crack or voters to fool. "Ours is the only election system that
     automatically prevents tampering and box stuffing as it sniffs out voter fraud attempts
     and malicious hackers," says Don Carter, senior vice president of VoteHere .Net. To
     safeguard against fraud, voters would be required to provide infor mation such as birth
     dates and Social Security numbers. To preserve privacy, the system uses one of the
     toughest encryp tion programs available to the public, says Carter, and balloters must
     give a voter encrypted registration number (VERN) provided when they register to vote
     via computer to guarantee they vote only once.

     That's not good enough for one key dis senter. "I don't totally disagree with the
     concept, but our traditional process is a good one," says party chairman Mike Fran cis.
     His solution is to increase the voting sites. "You could give away TV sets at the
     polling places, and you still wouldn't get more than 100,000 voters [out of the state's
     approximately 600,000 Republi cans] to show up," he says.

     # A quick little sploit for a quick round of beers :) mudge@L0pht.com

     #
     # This was something that had been floating around for some time.
     # It might have been bitwrior that pointed out some of the oddities
     # but I don't remember. 
     #
     # It was mentioned to Casper Dik at some point and it was fixed in
     # the next rev of Solaris (don't remember if the fix took place in
     # 2.5.1 or 2.6 - I know it is in 2.6 at least).
     #
     # What happened was that the Solaris 2.5 and below systems
     # had /bin/su written in the following fashion :
     #
     #    attempt to SU
     #          |
     #     succesfull
     #    /          \
     #   Y            N
     #   |            |
     # exec cmd     sleep
     #                |
     #             syslog
     #                |
     #              exit
     #
     # There were a few problems here - not the least of which was that they
     # did not bother to trap signals. Thus, if you noticed su taking a while
     # you most likely entered an incorrect password and were in the
     # sleep phase.
     #
     # Sending a SIGINT by hitting ctrl-c would kill the process
     # before the syslog of the invalid attempt occured.
     #
     # In current versions of /bin/su they DO trap signals.
     #
     # It should be noted that this is a fairly common coding problem that
     # people will find in a lot of "security related" programs.

2.02 --=\\sun.useradd.expir_date.txt\\=--

     This has been tested and verified only on Solaris 7.

     Sun has provided a useradd binary as well as the gui (admintool) for adding
     new users.  This program (it's a binary in Solaris 7) allows the "-e"
     parameter which purports to set the expiration date for a new account. The
     man page for it says:

          -e expire Specify the expiration date  for  a  login.  After
                    this  date,  no  user  will be able to access this
                    login. expire is a date entered in any format  you
                    like  (except  a  Julian date). If the date format
                    that  you  choose  includes  spaces,  it  must  be
                    quoted.  For  example,  you  may  enter 10/6/90 or
                    "October 6, 1990". A null value (" ") defeats  the
                    status  of the expired date. This option is useful
                    for creating temporary logins.

     The key here is that is says: "in any format you like".

     Using the system as it ships and using the parameter as (for example)
              "-e 6/30/2000"
     (in a vain attempt to avoid Y2K confusion) results in an expiration date of
     June 30, 2020, so if you are expecting the user accounts to expire soon,
     you will be a little disappointed.  If expiration dates are critical, you
     have a real problem - users can login for 20 years after you thought you
     had expired them!

     Workaround (supplied by Sun): replace /etc/datemsk with:
     
     #ident
     %m/%d/%y %I:%M:%S %p
     %m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p
     %m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S
     %m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S
     %m/%d/%y %I:%M %p
     %m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p
     %m/%d/%y %H:%M
     %m/%d/%Y %H:%M
     %m/%d/%y
     %m/%d/%Y
     %m/%d
     %b %d, %Y %I:%M:%S %p
     %b %d, %Y %H:%M:%S
     %B %d, %Y %I:%M:%S %p
     %B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S
     %b %d, %Y %I:%M %p
     %b %d, %Y %H:%M
     %B %d, %Y %I:%M %p
     %B %d, %Y %H:%M
     %b %d, %Y
     %B %d, %Y
     %b %d
     %m\%d\%H\%M\%y
     %m\%d\%H\%M\%Y
     %m\%d\%H\%M
     %m\%d\%H
     %m%d

     Your mileage may vary. I have not tested this to make sure it works
     correctly with 2-digit years (lower case 'y' in the mask above.)

     Sun has been notified of this and of the posting to BUGTRAQ.

     In the newest version of AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) there is a way to
     transfer files. When you are transferring the file, you can open a DOS
     prompt and type:

     netstat -a -n

     By doing this you (obviously) can get the person's IP address. Usually it
     will be on port 5190. This may seem pointless because usually not much can
     be done with simply an IP address, but under certain circumstances this can
     be useful.

     Last week I stumbled accross the following security hole in CDNow!, the
     online cd-store.  I emailed CDNow! regarding this immediately but as yet
     have not have any confirmation of receipt or response, so I decided to post
     the information here.  This is a copy of the email that I sent to CDNow.

     Security Hole Found

     I was just looking at my gift list, and pasted the URL to a mailing list.
     That is, the URL in my location bar, after doing so I thought, wait, thats
     not the URL I should have posted, so then sent the proper URL thinking that
     CDNOW is password protected and noone would be able to get to my account,
     but I decided to check by telnetting to a remote machine and going to that
     URL.

     The result was, I got a rejected cookie, and the page continued to load my
     gift list (in edit mode), I then followed a link to my account history, and
     details, and initiated steps to order a cd.  I'm assuming the SID paramter
     in the URL was looking up the open transaction/connection that I made from
     my local machine and was using that.

     My assumption is that this URL would only be valid for a certain amount of
     time, so the security flaw will eventually in an hour or so be closed off (I
     hope), however, the fact is that this hole does exist.

     Aleph ... Sorry if it is an old bug ...
        

     i have tested a bug in ssh-2.0.12.
        
     any remote attacker can guess  real account in the machine

     Details

     when a ssh client connects to the daemon it has a number ( default
     three ) of attempts to guess the correct password before
     disconnecting if you try to connect with a correct login, but
     you only have once if you try to connect with a no correct login.

     EXAMPLE

     alfonso is not user ( login ) in 192.168.0.1
        

     $ssh 192.168.0.1 -l alfonso
     alfonso's password: <hit ENTER key>
       
     Disconnected; authentication error (Authentication method disabled.).
     $

     altellez is user ( login ) in 192.168.0.1

     $ssh 192.168.0.1 -l altellez
     altellez's password: <hit ENTER key>
     altellez's password:

     Now the remote attacker known that altellez is a true login in
     192.168.0.1

     QUICK FIX

     Edit the file sshd2_config (usually at /etc/ssh2), set the value
     of "PasswordGuesses" to 1.
        
     I only has tested it with ssh-2.0.12

3.01 --=\\I Only Replaced index.html\\=--

     It would appear that the k-r4d kiddies who deface web pages have no concept of WHY
     their shenanigans illicit such a violent response from the companies they attack. This
     brief article will list some of the behind the scenes events that occur after the
     "harmless" replacement of index.html by our oh-so-favorite political activists.  

     1. The company is notified, usually by a customer, that their web page has been changed.  
     The server admin, Web Master, or whomever is responsible for the content is usually the 
     first person to be told of this event as the company probably doesn't have an incident 
     response plan.  

     2. The admin shits a brick and tells his manager.  The administrator, now in fear for
     his job, has to bite the bullet and tell his manager that the company has been
     "hacked".  He's probably afraid that the attacker got in through his weak password, or
     one of the boxes he know he should have upgraded six months ago.

     3. Upon hearing this, the manager shits a brick.  The mid-level manager now fears for
     HIS job knowing that the brunt of upper management's wrath will fall on his shoulders
     for not securing the systems.  The manager tries desperately to figure out whom to tell
     in upper management that will not fire him on the spot.  He calls his manager (usually
     a VP type) and tells her the news.

     4. Upon hearing this, she freaks out and shits a brick.  The VP calls Human Resources, 
     Legal, Security (if it exists), and the Director of Engineering or some other high-
     level geek type.  The group collectively decides if the site should be taken down or
     remain up. A call is also made to the CEO or other chieftain to inform him of the sit-
     uation.  After a quick consultation with the in-house counsel, the decision to contact
     or not contact law enforcement is made.  Usually, the upper level types are in knee-
     jerk mode and want to aggressively pursue the intruder "no matter what".

     5. All this time, the overworked admin has been scouring his systems looking for traces
     of how the attacker got in.  Despite the attacker's claims that "he only replaced
     index.html" the admin's manager wants EVERY system checked and any possible means of
     entry sealed off. The admin will now try to perform a comprehensive security audit in
     an hour.

     6. The upper level types contact the Marketing department to figure out how to handle
     the impact to the company's image.  Never faced with this sort of problem before, the
     Director of Marketing frets and calls all her people in for "a brainstorm" on how to
     handle the situation.

     7. The system is probably backed-up, taken down, and replaced with a newer box or a 
     significant upgrade (introducing new bugs) is made to the system.  This takes the busy
     admin the better part of a day.  Normally, this could be accomplished in a few hours,
     but with visibility on the VP and above level, the admin makes sure he does is
     perfectly.

     8. If law enforcement was called-in, they now spend time with the administrators and
     lawyers to figure out if they have a case (probably not, most of the evidence was
     accidentally destroyed by the admin in the first 4 hours after the incident).

     9. Upper level types now decree that the systems will be secured and that nothing like
     this will ever happen again.  It's likely that big name consultants are brought in at
     $200+/hour to assess the business and make recommendations to improve the site's secur-
     ity.  Since the admin is already busy doing day-to-day tasks, the consulting firm
     probably implements their recommendations (at $200+/hour).

     10. After a few weeks, things return to normal.  The company has new ACLs, a new fire-
     wall, and maybe some new policies.  

     Now, looking at this, one can see the number of personnel involved and the amount of
     time invested in recovering from the "harmless" defacing of index.html.  I haven't even
     addressed the additional problems posed when the admins discover a trojanized binary or
     unauthorized access to source code or other company trade secrets.  This is just the
     simple stuff.

     "But the attacker said in his 'message' that he backed-up index.html.  All they had to
     do was replace it with the original!"  No you stupid fool, no.  The attacker has
     publicly humiliated a corporation, has shown the world that the site's security is
     inadequate, and has caused significant personal turmoil for 5 or more people.

     Furthermore, if I come home one day to find my front door open and a note attached that
     says "Hi. Broke into your place. Only moved your stuff around.  Didn't take anything.
     Love, r0bb3r" am I supposed to believe that?  Would you?  If the company affected is
     publicly traded, they are legally _required_ to investigate and take measures to ensure
     that a similar incident doesn't occur.  If they don't, their shareholders can sue for
     negligence.

     Now, I can't possibly justify the tens of millions in losses claimed by companies in
     cases like Mitnick or others - that's lunacy.  However, reading the above, I hope it
     becomes clear that there is significant time and money spent to clean up these "simple"
     attacks.

4.01 --=\\wired.com\\=--

     [www.wired.com]

     A major security flaw in a Microsoft Web server could allow crackers to take complete
     control of e-commerce Web sites, security experts warned Tuesday.

     The flaw in Microsoft's Internet Information Server 4.0 allows unauthorized remote
     users to gain system-level access to the server, according to Firas Bushnaq, CEO of
     eEye <http://www.eeye.com/>, the Internet security firm that discovered it.

     "This hole is so serious it's scary," said Jim Blake, a network administrator for
     Irvine, a city in southern California.

     "With other [Windows NT] security holes, crackers have needed to gain some level of
     user access before executing code on the server. This is different.... Anybody off the
     Web can crack IIS," he said.

     More than 1.3 million Microsoft IIS servers are up and running on the Web. Nasdaq, Walt
     Disney, and Compaq are among the larger e-commerce operations run off the server,
     according to NetCraft <http://www.NetCraft.com/> Internet surveys.

     Microsoft confirmed that the problem exists and said that it is working on a fix.
     Customers, however, have not been notified.

     "Normally we will post the problem and the bug fix at the same time," said Microsoft
     spokeswoman Jennifer Todd. "We take these security issues very seriously, and the patch
     will be available [soon]."

     The fix will be posted to Microsoft's security Web site
     <http://www.microsoft.com/security/>, "probably in the next couple of days," Todd said. 
     The exploit is just one of a long list of security flaws affecting IIS 4.0. In May,
     security experts found an exploit
     <http://r.wired.com/r/10025/http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/19566.html>
     that enabled crackers to gain read access to files held on IIS when they requested
     certain text files. 

     Last summer, an exploit known as the $DATA Bug
     <http://r.wired.com/r/10025/http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/13426.html>
     granted any non-technical Web users access to sensitive information within the source
     code used in Microsoft's Active Server Page, which is used on IIS.

     And in January, a similar IIS security hole
     <http://r.wired.com/r/10025/http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/10136.html>
     was discovered, one that exposed the source code and certain system settings of files
     on Windows NT-based Web servers.

     But the latest problem appears to be the most serious because of the level of access it
     reportedly allows.

     "The exploit gives crackers access to any database or software residing on the Web
     server machine," said Bushnaq. "So they could steal credit-card information or even
     post counterfeit Web pages."

     For instance, crackers could exploit the bug to modify stock prices at one of the many
     news and stock information sites running IIS.

     The hole allows remote users to gain control of an IIS 4.0 server by creating what is
     known as a "buffer overflow" on .htr Web pages -- an IIS feature designed to enable
     users to remotely change their passwords.

     A buffer overflow can occur when a system is fed a value much larger than expected. In
     the case of the bug, the Dynamic Link Library (DLL) governing the .htr file extension,
     called ISM.DLL, can be overloaded by running a utility that loads too many characters
     into the library.

     Once overloaded, the DLL is disabled and the content of the overflow "bleeds" into the
     system.

     "Normally, this would just crash the system," said Space Rogue, a member of L0pht Heavy
     Industries, <http://www.l0pht.com/> an independent security consulting firm that last
     year testified before the United States Senate on government information security.

     "But a good cracker can write an exploit where the data that overflows will actually be
     a executable program that will run as machine code," said Space Rogue. Such a move
     could give a cracker complete control of the target system.

     The overflow executable program can be used to run a system-level program that will
     deliver the equivalent of a DOS command window to an attacker's PC.

     To demonstrate the hole, eEye wrote a program called IIS Hack that will enable users to
     crack and execute code on any IIS 4.0 Web Server.

     However, disabling or removing the .htr password utility will not fix the problem,
     according to Bushnaq. "You have got to go through a series of steps to remove the
     faulty [code]."

     Eeye discovered the problem while beta testing a network security auditing tool. 
     "Remote exploits are about the most serious problems you can have with a Web server,"
     said Space Rogue. "It gives the attacker root privileges, so the cracker not only has
     access to the IIS server but [to] software running on that machine."

     "In many corporate sites today, this will give the cracker access to the entire
     network" 
     
     Eeye is a software development firm specializing in security audit tools. Chief
     executive Bushnaq previously founded the electronic commerce site ECompany.com
     <http://www.ecompany.com/>.

     [www.infoworld.com]

     A small security consulting firm traded punches with Microsoft 
     this week over how to publicize a security flaw in Microsoft's Web
     server software. Microsoft posted an alert and workaround June 15, 
     after the other company, eEye, posted a way to exploit the flaw, 
     saying it was necessary to draw attention to the threat it poses. 

     "It was demonstrating how serious this is. Microsoft has not 
     responded to us since then," Firas Bushnaq, eEye CEO, said 
     Thursday. 

     Microsoft countered that it had been cooperating with eEye on the 
     problem until the other company broke Microsoft's policy of 
     publishing security warnings only once there is a remedy, so as 
     not to reveal a breach to would-be exploiters. 

     "Deliberately publishing a tool on one's Web site to let malicious
     users hurt innocent people is not being part of the solution," 
     Microsoft security product manager Scott Culp countered on 
     Thursday. "It is a mystery to us why [eEye] suddenly and abruptly 
     chose to stop working with us and take this public." 

     The flaw is a "buffer overflow" in Microsoft's Internet Information 
     Server (IIS) 4.0. This could allow junk or malicious code to 
     overwrite executable code, thereby making the Web server either 
     crash or execute unauthorized commands, Culp said. 

     Buffer overflows are caused by programmer error and are "very 
     common... one of the biggest of all network security problems," 
     Bushnaq said. 

     The IIS 4.0 bug could give a hacker access to various data on the 
     targeted Web server, including access to company files or customer
     information, depending on how the network is configured and which 
     break-in approach is used, Bushnaq added. 

     "It's a very, very serious problem that people need to fix as soon
     as possible," Bushnaq said. 

     Officials at eEye notified Microsoft of the problem June 8, but 
     were frustrated by the lack of response during the next several 
     days, Bushnaq said. On Monday, June 14, the company decided to 
     make the problem public. 

     Since then, eEye has gotten hundreds of e-mail messages in favor 
     of its decision, compared to about four criticizing it, Bushnaq 
     said. 

     "The big issue now is that Microsoft's PR is [painting] eEye as a 
     company that's irresponsible and pointing to something bad," 
     Bushnaq said. 

     But Culp said Microsoft's security team had been working intensively 
     with eEye, as it does with other companies and users that report 
     security problems. They had had exchanged about 20 e-mail messages 
     last week, before eEye unilaterally decided to go public, he said. 

     "[Their decision] left a lot of people at risk ... compounded by 
     irresponsibly publishing that [exploitation] tool," Culp said. 

     Microsoft hopes to release the final patch very soon, Culp said. 
     In the meantime, the company is offering a workaround in its June
     15 security bulletin, which can be found at 
     www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-019.asp 

     eEye's patch can be found at www.eeye.com/database/advisories/

4.04 --=\\iss_injector.c.txt\\=--

     I read yesturday on eEye.com that they had discovered a buffer overflow in
     IIS.  I could not resist writing an exploit.  I did not have time to design
     a really cool payload for this exploit, so I simply wrote the injection
     code.  However, this is meaningful for several reasons.  Attached is the
     injection code.  The exploit will deliver any payload of your choosing.
     Your payload will be executed.  This empowers you to create a "collection"
     of payloads that are not dependant upon the injection vector in any way.
     This decoupling is important for military needs, where a single injection
     vector needs to work, but the "warhead" may be different depending on the
     targets characterization.

     The exploit was fairly simple to build.  In short, I read on eEye.com that
     they had overflowed IIS with something like a ~3000 character URL.  Within
     minutes I had caused IIS to crash with EIP under my control.  I used a
     special pattern in the buffer (see code) to make it easy for me to identify
     where EIP was being popped from.  The pattern also made it easy to
     determine where I was jumping around.  Use the tekneek Danielson. ;-)

     So, I controlled EIP, but I needed to get back to my stack segment, of
     course.  This is old school, and I really lucked out.  Pushed down two
     levels on the stack was an address for my buffer.  I couldn't have asked
     for more.  So, I found a location in NTDLL.DLL (0x77F88CF0) that I could
     return to.  It had two pop's followed by a return.  This made my injection
     vector return to the value that was stored two layers down on the stack.
     Bam, I was in my buffer.  So, I landed in a weird place, had to add a near
     jump to get to somewhere more useful.. nothing special, and here we are
     with about 2K of payload space.  If you don't supply any mobile code to be
     run, the injection vector will supply some for you.  The default payload in
     simply a couple of no-ops followed by a debug breakpoint (interrupt 3)...
     It's easy to play with if you want to build your own payloads.. just keep a
     debugger attached to inetinfo.exe on the target machine.

     Lastly, I would simply like to point out that monoculture installations are
     very dangerous.  It's a concept from agribusiness.. if you have all one
     crop, and a virus comes along that can kill that crop, your out of
     business.  With almost ALL of the IIS servers on the net being vulnerable
     to this exploit, we also have a monoculture.  And, it's not just IIS.  The
     backbone of the Internet is built on common router technology (such as
     cisco IOS).  If a serious exploit comes along for the IOS kernel, can you
     imagine the darkness that will fall?
