0.01 --=\\What?\\=--

    What is 'Antidote'? Well, we wouldn't say that Antidote is a hacking magazine, cause
    that would be wrong. We don't claim to be a hacking magazine. All Antidote is, is
    basically current news and happenings in the underground world. We aren't going to teach
    you how to hack or anything, but we will supply you with the current information and
    exploits. Mainly Antidote is just a magazine for people to read if they have some extra
    time on there hands and are bored with nothing to do. If you want to read a magazine
    that teaches you how to hack etc, then you might want to go to your local bookstore and
    see if they carry '2600'.

   ------------------------------


0.02 --=\\FAQ\\=--

    Here are a lot of questions that we seem to recieve a lot, or our "Frequently Asked
    Questions". Please read this before e-mailing us with questions and if the question
    isn't on here or doesn't make sense, then you can e-mail us with your question.

    > What exactly is "Antidote"?
      See section 0.01 for a complete description.	
	
    > I find Antidote to not be shot for the beginner or does not teach you the basics,
    why is that?
      Antidote is for everyone, all we are basically is a news ezine that comes out once
      a week with the current news, exploits, flaws and even programming. All of the
      articles that are in here are recieved second hand (sent to us) and we very rarely
      edit anyone's articles.

    > I just found Antidote issues on your webpage, is there anyway I can get them sent
    to me through e-mail?
      Yes, if you go to www.thepoison.org/antidote there should be a text box where you can
      input your e-mail address. You will recieve a link to the current Antidote (where you
      can view it).

    > If I want to submit something, are there any 'rules'?
      Please see section 0.03 for a complete description.
	
    > If I submitted something, can I remain anonymous?
      Yes. Just make sure that you specify what information about yourself you would like to
      be published above your article (when sending it to us) and we will do what you say.

    > I submitted something and I didn't see it in the current/last issue, why is that?
      It could be that someone else wrote something similar to what you wrote and they sent
      it to us first. If you sent us something and we didn't e-mail you back, then you might
      want to send it again because we probably didn't get it (we respond to all e-mails no
      matter what). We might use your article in future issues off Antidote.

    > Can I submit something that I didn't "discover" or "write"?
      Yes you can, we take information that is written by anyone regardless if you wrote it
      or not.

    Well thats it for our FAQ. If you have a question that is not on here or the question is
    on here and you had trouble understanding it, then please feel free to e-mail
    lordoak@thepoison.org and he will answer your question. This FAQ will probably be
    updated every month.

0.04 --=\\Writing\\=--

    As many of you know, we are always open to articles/submittings. We will take almost
    anything that has to do with computer security. This leaves you open for:

	-Protecting the system (security/securing)
	-Attacking the system (hacking, exploits, flaws, etc....)
	-UNIX (really anything to do with it...)
	-News that has to do with any of the above....

    The only thing that we really don't take is webpage hacks, like e-mailing us and saying
    "www.xxx.com" was hacked... But if you have an opinion about the hacks that is fine. If
    you have any questions about what is "acceptable" and not, please feel free to e-mail
    Lord Oak [lordoak@thepoison.org] with your question and he will answer it. Also, please
    note that if we recieve two e-mails with the same topic/idea then we will use the one
    that we recieved first. So it might be a good idea to e-mail one of us and ask us if
    someone has written about/on this topic so that way you don't waste your time on writing
    something that won't be published. An example of this would be:

	If Joe sends me an e-mail with the topic being on hacking hotmail accounts on
	thursday.
	And then Bill sends us an e-mail on hacking hotmail accounts on sunday, we will
	take Joe's article because he sent it in first.

    But keep in mind, we might use your article for the next issue! If you have something
    that you would like to submit to Antidote, please e-mail lordoak@thepoison.org or
    duece@thepoison.org  and one of us will review the article and put it in Antidote (if we
    like it).

1.01 --=\\UCITA almost Approved\\=-- 

    [www.infoworld.com]

    Imagine the horror of walking into work one day to find your software vendor holding
    your company hostage by threatening to shut down your mission-critical systems unless
    you concede to its terms.

    Sounds illegal, right?  Perhaps not.

    Although many IT professionals are unaware of it, that practice will become legally
    defensible if new legislation called the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act,
    or UCITA, is approved.

    UCITA is a proposed law for applying consistent rules to computer software licenses
    across all 50 states.  It would

      * give vendors the right to repossess software by disabling it remotely;

      * make the terms of shrink-wrapped licenses more enforceable;

      * prevent the transfer of licenses from one party to another without vendor
        permission;

      * allow vendors to disclaim warrantees;

      * outlaw reverse engineering.

    Proponents of the law, primarily software vendors, say it is time for a uniform law that
    applies directly to software licenses.  Critics, including technology consumer groups
    such as the Society of Information Managers (SIM), say UCITA is fatally flawed and
    should be killed.  Other trade organizations representing the motion picture industry,
    newspapers, magazines, and the music recording industry, have joined SIM in opposing
    UCITA.

    In July, a state attorney organization known as the National Conference of Commissioners
    on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) will meet in Denver to approve UCITA.  If the organiza-
    tion gives the proposal a green light, a few state legislatures are likely to rubber-
    stamp it by the end of the year and UCITA will become law, according to UCITA experts.

    This fast time table has opponents up in arms.  Although SIM is in favor of a law to
    govern software licensing, it says it believes UCITA cannot be fixed.

    "This law would significantly increase the level of the burden on the IT procurement
    function and significantly increase the cost of procurement -- both in staff costs and
    out-of-pocket costs," says Susan Nycum, a SIM member and an attorney at law firm Baker &
    McKenzie, in Palo Alto, Calif.

    Although many software vendor representatives attended development meetings to discuss
    the law and lobbied its creators, most attendees contacted by InfoWorld refused to
    discuss their views on the record.

    And although this law threatens to profoundly affect how IT departments in both large
    and small companies do business, most IT professionals remain unaware of the law and its
    ramifications.

    "We were naive about how things were handled," says Randy Roth, a SIM member who also
    works at the Principal Financial Group, in Des Moines, Iowa.  "We thought, gee, when
    people are writing these laws they are making sure they are balanced and somebody is
    watching out for our best interests."

1.02 --=\\FBI missing the Real Hacking Threat?\\=--

    [www.zdnet.com]

    With the FBI executing 16 search warrants in 12 cities, U.S. attorney Paul Coggins said
    Wednesday the Federal Government's "massive" hunt for the hackers responsible for a
    string of high-profile hacks of government sites was "the most far reaching hacking
    investigation ever conducted by the Department of Justice." 


    Several security watchers, however, consider the manhunt a distraction, and say that the
    biggest threats to online security are the hackers who aren't making headlines -- an
    observation supported by Wednesday's hack of the Department of Energy's Brookhaven
    National Laboratory. 

    In the Brookhaven hack, intruders claiming to be the Posse replaced the laboratory's
    home page with a picture of TV personality Rosie O'Donnell and a treatise. According to
    security watchers, the Posse is more sophisticated than the hackers behind previous
    government site hacks. 

    The Posse's note prominently thanked the script kiddies, who use script-based programs
    to break into servers, for grabbing the attention of the FBI. "While you have been keep-
    ing the FBI (Federal Bureau Of Instigation) and SS (Secret Cervix) busy tracking down 14
    year old hacker hopefuls; we have spent our time burrowing ourselves deep within
    Corporate America," the Posse's note read at one point.

    While the Brookhaven hack was quickly removed, MSNBC reported that the site itself was
    taken offline between 5:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. PT. 

    'The biggest threats'
    "The guys who broke into the White House site, it's like living in D.C., running over to
    the White House and spray painting it," said B.K. DeLong, a security consultant in
    Boston. "The biggest threats are the hackers that aren't making themselves known."


    "There's a limit to what they (the script kiddies) could do," DeLong noted. "But if
    these guys are getting in, what about the really experienced guys?"

    An FBI official denied that FBI resources are being stretched thin by investigations
    into comparatively minor hacking incidents.

    "That's an erroneous statement," said FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman. "We take any type
    of intrusion to a government computer very seriously." Agency officials "understand that
    some individuals may simply want to make a statement" by putting up digital graffiti,
    but by accessing government systems, "they are still committing a crime," she said.

    While there had been speculation that the Department of Defense would pull its Web site
    down to guard against hacking incidents, an agency spokesman said Wednesday there's no
    plan for a wholesale shutdown of the site.

    "Only certain pages are being taken down" to gauge their security, DoD spokesman Glenn
    Flood said. Public information on the site will remain up during the testing, set to
    begin later Wednesday and be concluded later this week, he said.

1.03 --=\\Microsoft Employee Raided\\=--

    [www.msnbc.com]

    JEFFREY ROBERSON, 19, was a self-described angry little kid two years ago, fairly well-
    known as VallaH on the hacking scene, dabbling in writing hacker software tools. At his
    worst, he says, he wrote software that crashed victim’s computers, forcing them to
    reboot. Then a Microsoft employee saw his programming code, was duly impressed and
    invited VallaH to Redmond, Wash. Over time, Roberson was convinced to put his skills to
    good use and took the job. He’s spent the past year working on Windows 2000, testing for
    interoperability with Unix systems his specialty.

    But he also stayed involved in the hacker scene. He says he hadn’t done anything illegal
    since taking his job at Microsoft; in fact he says he spent his time trying to convince
    other angry little kids that they could be creative instead of destructive. I talked to
    them because I wanted to try to help them program. But someone passed his handle to the
    FBI recently. Then his Seattle-area apartment was raided May 26 in the hacker sweep, and
    VallaH’s life instantly changed. His assignment at Microsoft was immediately terminated
    he’s now pleading his case with the company, hoping to get a new assignment.

2.01 --=\\nt.ras_rras.password.txt\\=--

    On March 20th, Dieter Goepferich [dieter.goepferich@bigfoot.com]
    discovered a vulnerability involving both RAS and RRAS. This was
    subsequently reported in Heise Online, a German publication;

    http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/cp-12.04.99-000/
    http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/hos-15.04.99-000/

    Dieter originally reported it via some "product improvement suggestion"
    web form on www.microsoft.de back in March. Together we informed
    Microsoft Security (secure@microsoft.com) back in April.

    By default the registry key is only accessible to Administrator and the
    user/owner of the passwords, but it represents a potential threat and a
    location of password information which would not otherwise be expected.

    See;

    http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-017.asp

    for the complete write up including fix locations. There are two KB
    articles about this (one for RAS, and another for RRAS). They were not
    yet available at the time of writing.

2.02 --=\\NetIQ.txt\\=--

    AppManager is a product which enables an enterprise to monitor the performance and 
    availability of Windows NT server services such as Exchange, SQL, etc.  It does this 
    via an agent on the target machine which reports back to a console.  The agents monitor 
    for things like low disk space, misbehaving services, and so on.  Like most products that 
    follow a manager/agent architecture, the agents must use an account with Administrator 
    privileges in order to do their job.  The problem is that when the authentication occurs, 
    the userid and password are passed in clear text, meaning that anyone with a sniffer can 
    read it as it goes across the wire.

    The other problem is that when someone with access to the AppManager console goes to look
    at a job, all he or she must do is right-click on the job, select Properties, select the 
    View tab, and voila! The userid and password that the job is using is right there for all 
    to see.  With version 3.0 they have replaced the password with asterisks, but the company 
    conceded that if someone were to copy the asterisks and paste them into a text file then the 
    password would be displayed instead of the asterisks!  More security through obscurity.

    The only fix so far is for an AppManager administrator to go into the Properties and 
    manually backspace over the password to remove it.  Once this is done it will not appear 
    again on any of the consoles.  However, if an "agent installation" job is run, the password
    WILL be displayed in Properties, but only for the duration on the install, which is usually
    between ten and fifteen minutes.  There is currently no way to prevent this.

    According to the company this is a "known issue."  After some more discussion I found that
    they have known about this for two years, yet apparently have not done anything to rectify 
    it.  They said that encrypting the authentication sequence traffic is difficult to do 
    which is one of the reasons why they haven't fixed it yet.  If their programmers can't 
    figure out in two years how to encrypt traffic then I think a another product should be
    chosen.

2.03 --=\\compaq_insight.server.txt\\=--

    Problem:  The web server included in Compaq Insight
              Manager could expose sensitive information.

    Threat:   Anyone that have access to port 2301 where
              Compaq Insight Manager is installed could get
              unrestricted access to the servers disk through
              the "root dot dot" bug.

    Platform: Detected on Windows NT and Novell Netware servers
              running on Compaq hardware.

    Solution: Disable the Compaq Insight Manager web server or
              restrict anonymous access.


    Vulnerability Description
    -------------------------
    When installing Compaq Insight Manager a web server gets installed. This web
    server runs on port 2301 and is vulnerable to the old "root dot dot" bug. This
    bug gives unrestricted access to the vulnerable server?s disk. It could easily
    get exploited with one of the URLs:

    http://vulnerable-NT.com:2301/../../../winnt/repair/sam._
    http://vulnerable-Netware.com:2301/../../../system/ldremote.ncf

    (How many dots there should be is install-dependent)


    Solution
    --------
    You could probably fix the problem by restricting anonymous access to the Compaq
    Insight Manager web server. If you are not using the web server, Infosec
    recommends disabling the service.


    Background
    ----------
    Infosec gives the credits to Master Dogen who first reported the problem
    (Windows NT and Compaq Insight Manager) to us and wanted us go public with a
    vulnerability report.

    Infosec have found that Novell Netware with Compaq Insight Manager have the same
    problem but is not as common as on Windows NT.

    Compaq Sweden was informed about this problem april 26, 1999.

2.04 --=\\pc_anywhere.dos.txt\\=--

    Hello all,This is my first post to the group so I'll try to keep it as brief as
    possible.  Searching through the bugtraq archives, I came across articles
    001732, 001734, 001737, and 001739 regarding PC Anywhere.  So, I fired up my
    telnet client, pointed it at port 5631 on a non-production host, and pasted
    about 512kb of garbage (I copied & pasted a dll I opened in notepad) into it
    when PC Anywhere responded with "Please press <Enter>".  About 200k through
    this dump, PC Anywhere hangs, utilizing 100% of the CPU, rendering the
    target host useless but not crashing it. There's your DoS.

    I ran this attack over TCP/IP against a couple of fully patched NT 4.0
    Workstations (SP4), and a couple of fully patched NT 4.0 Servers (SP4), with
    802up_a, 802up_b, and hostup_b applied to PC Anywhere, RAS was not installed
    on any of the hosts. I got the same results on all machines.

    I got in touch with Symantec development and found out that they do have a
    fix for this problem, it's a patched aw32tcp.dll, it just hasn't made it to
    their website yet.  I have applied this fix to several machines (all with
    the afore mentioned PC Anywhere patches applied) and it does indeed fix the
    problem.

    Hope this info will help.  Thanks for your time.

     *  Sincere Apologizes: duke (for the mistake we made with the wu-expl), 
     *                     your code rocks.
     *
     *  Usage:

     *    SDI-pop2 <imap_server> <user> <pass> [offset]   
     *
     *   where  imap_server = IMAP server at your box (or other place as well)

     *  ----------------------------------------------------------------
     *  HOWTO-exploit:

     *   any other machine which you have an account.
     *     
     *   During the anonymous_login() function, the ipop2d will set the

2.07 --=\\netscape.view_source.htm.txt\\=--

    There is a security vulnerability in Netscape Communicator 4.6 Win95,
    4.07 Linux (probably all 4.x versions) in the way
    it works with "view-source:wysiwyg://1/javascript" URLs. It parses them
    in a "view-source" window.
    The problem is that it allows access to documents included in the parent
    document via
    ILAYER SRC="view-source:wysiwyg://1/" using find(). That allows reading
    the whole parsed document.

    Vulnerabilites:

     Browsing local directories
     Reading user's cache
     Reading parsed HTML files
     Reading Netscape's configuration ("about:config") including user's
    email address, mail servers and password.
     Probably others

3.01 --=//ZKS Freedom AIP//=--

    Although the ZKS Freedom AIP protocol (as described in version 1.0 of the
    ZKS whitepaper) is conceptually similar to the PipeNet protocol, there are
    several attacks against ZKS which PipeNet is not susceptible to. The
    reason is that PipeNet uses end-to-end traffic padding, whereas ZKS only
    uses link padding. I came up with several attacks against link padding
    systems while developing PipeNet, which is why I ultimately choose
    end-to-end padding. However one can argue that end-to-end padding is too
    costly, and that these attacks are not practical because they require a
    global observer or the cooperation of one or more of the anonymous router
    (AIP) operators. ZKS has not publicly made this argument, but since they
    are probably aware of these earlier attacks they must have followed its
    reasoning.

    I hope the practicality of the new attack presented here will change their
    mind. In this attack, a user creates an anonymous route from himself
    through a pair of AIPs back to himself. He then increases the traffic
    through this route until total traffic between the pair of AIPs reach the
    bandwidth limit set by the ZKS Traffic Shaper. At this point the AIPs no
    longer send any padding packets to each other, and the real traffic
    throughput between them can be deduced by subtracting the traffic sent by
    the attacker from the bandwidth limit. 

    This attack implies that link padding buys virtually no security. An
    attacker, without access to network sniffers or cooperation of any AIP
    operator, can strip off link padding and obtain real-time throughput data
    between all pairs of AIPs. If end-to-end padding is not used, this data
    would correlate with traffic throughput of individual users, and
    statistical analysis could then reveal their supposedly anonymous routes.
