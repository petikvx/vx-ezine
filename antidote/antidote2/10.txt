0.01 --=\\What?\\=--

     What is 'Antidote'? Well, we wouldn't say that Antidote is a hacking magazine, cause
     that would be wrong. We don't claim to be a hacking magazine. All Antidote is, is
     basically current news and happenings in the underground world. We aren't going to
     teach you how to hack or anything, but we will supply you with the current information
     and exploits. Mainly Antidote is just a magazine for people to read if they have some
     extra time on there hands and are bored with nothing to do. If you want to read a maga-
     zine that teaches you how to hack etc, then you might want to go to your local book-
     store and see if they carry '2600'.

   ------------------------------


0.02 --=\\FAQ\\=--

     Here are a lot of questions that we seem to recieve a lot, or our "Frequently Asked
     Questions". Please read this before e-mailing us with questions and if the question
     isn't on here or doesn't make sense, then you can e-mail us with your question.
 
     > What exactly is "Antidote"?
       See section 0.01 for a complete description.	
	
     > I find Antidote to not be shot for the beginner or does not teach you the basics,
       why is that?
       Antidote is for everyone, all we are basically is a news ezine that comes out once
       a week with the current news, exploits, flaws and even programming. All of the
       articles that are in here are recieved second hand (sent to us) and we very rarely
       edit anyone's articles.

     > I just found Antidote issues on your webpage, is there anyway I can get them sent
       to me through e-mail?
       Yes, if you go to www.thepoison.org/antidote there should be a text box where you can
       input your e-mail address. You will recieve a link to the current Antidote (where you
       can view it).

     > If I want to submit something, are there any 'rules'?
       Please see section 0.03 for a complete description.
	
     > If I submitted something, can I remain anonymous?
       Yes. Just make sure that you specify what information about yourself you would like
       to be published above your article (when sending it to us) and we will do what you
       say.

     > I submitted something and I didn't see it in the current/last issue, why is that?
       It could be that someone else wrote something similar to what you wrote and they sent
       it to us first. If you sent us something and we didn't e-mail you back, then you
       might want to send it again because we probably didn't get it (we respond to all e-
       mails no matter what). We might use your article in future issues off Antidote.

     > Can I submit something that I didn't "discover" or "write"?
       Yes you can, we take information that is written by anyone regardless if you wrote it
       or not.

     Well thats it for our FAQ. If you have a question that is not on here or the question
     is on here and you had trouble understanding it, then please feel free to e-mail
     lordoak@thepoison.org and he will answer your question. This FAQ will probably be
     updated every month.

     mail lordoak@thepoison.org and he will be sure to add you.

   ------------------------------


0.05 --=\\Writing\\=--

     As many of you know, we are always open to articles/submittings. We will take almost
     anything that has to do with computer security. This leaves you open for:

         -Protecting the system (security/securing)
         -Attacking the system (hacking, exploits, flaws, etc....)
         -UNIX (really anything to do with it...)
         -News that has to do with any of the above....

     The only thing that we really don't take is webpage hacks, like e-mailing us and saying
     "www.xxx.com" was hacked... But if you have an opinion about the hacks that is fine. If
     you have any questions about what is "acceptable" and not, please feel free to e-mail
     Lord Oak [lordoak@thepoison.org] with your question and he will answer it. Also, please
     note that if we recieve two e-mails with the same topic/idea then we will use the one
     that we recieved first. So it might be a good idea to e-mail one of us and ask us if
     someone has written about/on this topic so that way you don't waste your time on
     writing something that won't be published. An example of this would be:

	If Joe sends me an e-mail with the topic being on hacking hotmail accounts on
	thursday.
	And then Bill sends us an e-mail on hacking hotmail accounts on sunday, we will
	take Joe's article because he sent it in first.

     But keep in mind, we might use your article for the next issue! If you have something
     that you would like to submit to Antidote, please e-mail lordoak@thepoison.org or
     duece@thepoison.org  and one of us will review the article and put it in Antidote (if
     we like it).

1.01 --=\\RIO Redbox\\=--

     The construction, possession, and/or operation of this device may be a
     criminal offence. Don't do it. This information is presented because it
     is common and readily available. 

     This article is based on a Canadian Perspective, with some US info, but
     the procedures are Canadian.


     Purpose:

     If you are one of the MP3 lovers out there that own a Diamond RIO (gotta
     love these things), you can easily convert them to a nice Redbox for free
     calls and as a replacement for that damned annoying HOLD MUSIC!


     How-to:

     1. Get a hold of a Diamond RIO PMP300, easy enough if you've got the money.
        (They ain't cheap, but they are worth it just for the mp3 part.)

     2. Get the tones. In Canada you need to generate Canadian N-ACTS tones, and
        in the US you need to use American ACTS tones. Use a program like Cool
        Edit (http://www.syntrillium.com) to generate the tones. Here are the
        tones you need to make:

        N-ACTS (Canadian):
        Nickel - 2200hz 0.06s on 
        Dime - 2200hz 0.06s on, 0.06s off, twice repeating 
        Quarter - 2200hz 33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating 

        ACTS (American):
        Nickel - 1700+2200hz  0.060s on
        Dime - 1700+2200hz  0.060s on, 0.060s off, twice repeating
        Quarter - 1700+2200hz  33ms on, 33ms off, 5 times repeating

        (5 times, as in "on, off, on, off, on, off, on, off, on")

     3. Convert the tones to Mp3's. At this time, the most lean and clean program
        I've found is the FhG Mpeg Layer-3 Producer from Opticom
        (http://www.opticom.de/) it allows you to encode any Windows PCM wav file.
        Encode the tones at the highest rate you can, usually 128kBits/s and
        44,100Hz Stereo. This limits any distortion that the encoding may cause
     (anything lower and the tones are useless). They take
        less than a second to encode on a decent processor.

     4. Load the RIO. Use whatever software you use to load your RIO up. Make sure
   you remember which track was which coin.  

     5. Outputting the tones. This is pretty much open for you to do yourselves.
        You just need a speaker with a high enough fidelity and a decent output.
        A prefab speaker from radio shack can work, or you can modify a PC speaker
        or something with a Mini-din connector to hook into the RIO. The choice is
        up to you. I found that a prefab, 2", battery amplified portable speaker
        works quite well, and doesn't look to conspicuous if you're searched. Just
        a jumble of wires and speakers McGyvered together.

     6. Using your Rio Redbox. 

        Long distance

        1. Dial a long distance number. 
        2. You will be connected with an electronic or human operator telling you
           how much money to deposit. Insert $.05, Hold the RIOBox speaker up to
           the phones mouthpiece and play the required number of tones. Don't be
           afraid of putting in a few cents worth extra, redboxing doesn't need
           exact change.
        3. When more money is required play more tones into the mouthpiece.

        Local Calls

        1. Dial information or an operator and ask them to place your call for
           you. If they ask why, come up with a unique excuse.
        2. She will ask for money. Insert 5 cents first and then use your RIOBox.
           This prevents the operator from "seeing" that you are using a RIOBox.
           This may or may not be necessary. Experiment. 

        International Calls

        1. Dial an international phone number.
        2. An operator will ask for money. Insert 5 cents first and then use your
           RIOBox. This prevents the operator from "seeing" that you are using a
           RIOBox. This may or may not be necessary. Experiment. 
        3. When more money is required play more tones into the mouthpiece. 


     Notes and suggestions:

     A suggestion is to insert a second of silence before and after the tone so
     you have time to hit the stop button so the RIO doesn't blow through all the
     tones in 2 seconds.  This also gives you a chance to randomize the "coins"
     your inserting, so as not to alert any powers that be.

     Another would be to pickup a small 2-4 Meg smartmedia card for storing these.
     That way you can keep the tones hidden, but easily accessible. Plus the card
     can be destroyed quickly in case of trouble and you'll be left with a nice
     (legal) RIO.

     You may also want to mix (with random time between coins) preset amounts,
     like $2.50 or $3.95 and have them on a separate track for convenience sake,
     especially if you know before hand how much it's gonna cost.

1.02 --=\\MicroScared goes Ape Shit for Privacy\\=--

     [www.techserver.com]

     Microsoft Corp., the largest advertiser on the Internet, has decided it will not buy
     ads next year on Web sites that fail to publish adequate privacy promises to consumers.
     The announcement comes less than three months after a similar decision by IBM, the
     Web's second-largest advertiser. 

     The actions by the two companies come as the Federal Trade Commission prepares its
     recommendations to Congress on whether tough new federal privacy laws are needed to
     protect consumers online. 

     The Microsoft announcement to be made Wednesday was expected at a computer conference
     in New York and will take effect after the end of the year. Microsoft said it spent
     about $30 million last year on Web ads - but that's still a small portion of the $2
     billion spent last year on Web advertising, according to the Internet Advertising Bur-
     eau. 

     Microsoft, which has lobbied with other industry groups against privacy laws legisla-
     tion, earlier this year began offering a free digital tool kit that promises to allow
     consumers to use next-generation software to restrict what personal details Web sites
     collect about them. 

     Consumers typically must manually find a company's online privacy statement, if one
     exists, and read through legalese to determine what personal information a Web site
     might be harvesting, such as their name, e-mail address or even favorite authors or
     clothing sizes. 

     Last month, an industry-financed study showed businesses have made dramatic improve-
     ments since last year in warning people how companies use personal information collec-
     ted about them. 

     Nearly two-thirds of commercial Internet sites displayed at least some warning that
     businesses were collecting personal details from visitors, such as names, postal and e-
     mail addresses, and even shopping tastes, the study found. But less than 10 percent of
     those sites had what experts consider comprehensive privacy policies. 

     A similar study last summer by the FTC found only 14 percent of sites warned how
     companies used private information they collected about customers.

1.03 --=\\Crypto bill Passed\\=--

     [www.wired.com]

     A bill to relax strict US export limits on computer data-scrambling technology moved
     ahead in the Senate Wednesday, but still faces several hurdles, including White House
     opposition.

     The Senate Commerce Committee's approval of S798, the Promote Reliable On-Line Tran-
     sactions to Encourage Commerce and Trade Act (PROTECT), marked a victory for technology
     companies. The panel favored a far more restrictive approach two years ago, but revers-
     ed course after a powerful lobbying campaign by the industry. 

     Scrambling or encryption technology, which is included in everything from cable tele-
     vision control boxes to email and Web browsing software, has become a critical means of
     securing global communications and electronic commerce over the Internet.

1.04 --=\\Hacked site Alleges Media Conspiracy\\=--

     [www.7am.com]
 
     Although repaired and back online within just a few short hours, the Thanks-CGI website
     appears to have been hit a second time by the "Hackers In Paradise" group. 

     This time the group appear happy to have simply changed the scrolling javascript banner
     at the bottom of the page to read "HiP Welcomes you to THANKS-CGI.... We're trying to
     make your site more secure for the world!" 

     The operator of the website has told 7am.com that they are currently testing for holes
     in their CGI scripts. They have suggested that the security hole may not be the fault
     of their scripts -- rather that it could have been a "misconfiguration between cgi
     script and the server." 

     7am.com discovered the hack while researching another story on CGI resources and
     contacted the site's operator by email immediately the problem was noticed. However,
     the operator of the Thanks-CGI site has suggested that because "the arrival of your e-
     mail was paced so closely with the occurence [sic] of the hackage ... we have strong
     reason to believe there might be a relationship between 7am.com and the hacker who
     hacked our site."

1.05 --=\\Congress warned of hacker threats\\=--

     [www.usatoday.com]

     Government Web sites and computer networks are increasingly vulnerable to "cyber
     attacks'' because they lack trained personnel and don't follow security plans, federal
     officials warned a congressional committee Thursday.

     Few people have adequate training to defend government Web sites, and those who do
     seldom work in government for long, three panelists told the House Science Committee's
     subcommittee on technology.

     The security agencies "train people at government expense and the private sector waves
     a bigger paycheck and takes them away,'' said Keith Rhodes, technical director with the
     General Accounting Office.

     In addition, government security experts often find their advice isn't followed, said
     Raymond Kammer, director of the National Institutes for Standards and Technology, which
     recommends security measures for federal computers.

     "It is imperative that federal agencies implement vigorous security programs,'' Rhodes
     said.

     Hacker attacks like the recent defacing of the Senate Web site are well documented, but
     information about attempts to access sensitive intelligence information is "very
     sketchy,'' said Michael Jacobs, a deputy director of the National Security Agency.

     Hackers are often nearly impossible to trace unless they boast of their actions. 
     In the most common type of attack, hackers overwhelm Web sites with a flood of requests
     for information, causing the site to slow or shut down. Hackers can also redirect
     visitors to a fake Web site that appears to be the official site, as happened earlier
     this month to the Senate site.

     "We are clearly seeing an escalation in both the destructive nature and aggressive pace
     of these and other attacks,'' Jacobs said.

1.06 --=\\GSA launches intrusion-detection net\\=--

     [www.fcw.com]

     The General Services Administration last week asked industry for information about
     emerging security technology for detecting unauthorized users on agency networks, with
     the goal of building a government intrusion-detection system by the end of next year.

     In building the Federal Intrusion Detection Network (Fidnet), GSA hopes to find security
     tools vendors are developing that overcome the weaknesses of existing technology. By
     keeping ahead of the latest technology, GSA hopes to leave agency defenses less vulner-
     able to hackers, agency officials said.

     "We want to encourage people to develop new technologies that will help us keep neck and
     neck with the perpetrator," said David Jarrell, program manager for the GSA portion of
     Fidnet in the Federal Technology Service's Office of Information Security and technical
     director of the Federal Computer Incident Response Capability. 

     OIS will look not only to established intrusion-detection vendors but to new companies
     and people that "we haven't even heard of," Jarrell said. 

     "I think there are people out there that are significantly brilliant enough to solve
     this and we hope that this [request for information] will cause them to come forward,"
     he said.

     GSA plans to use the vendor-provided information to develop prototypes by the first
     quarter of fiscal 2000, said Tom Burke, GSA's assistant commissioner of information
     security. Down the line, OIS may even pay some of the vendors to put together a long-
     term, real-world demonstration of their capabilities at an agency, he said.

     GSA particularly is interested in finding intrusion-detection systems that are more
     capable of detecting attacks as they happen instead of after the fact.

     The problem is that most intrusion-detection solutions work the same way anti-virus
     protection does: They check network-use patterns against a known list of intrusion
     "signatures" and send out alerts when they come across a match.

     But as vendors and users have known for years, this method will not catch intrusions
     that are not on that list. Also, most products just now are advancing to the point where
     they alert administrators at the time an intrusion takes place.

     "We find that many of the off-the-shelf products that are available today are really a
     response to the intrusions, and they are always a step behind the intruder," Jarrell
     said. "We want to look to the future and some artificial intelligence that will learn as
     it goes about the attacks that are being launched." 

     This type of capability would be more than welcome to agencies, especially if they are
     enabled to respond more quickly at the local level, said one senior civilian agency
     official. 

     Others recognized the potential benefits of sharing attack "experience" across govern-
     ment.

     "What I would hope this next-generation intrusion detection could bring to us is the
     capability not only to monitor [intrusions] but to put together the information in a
     history for reference," said Sarah Jane League, Defense Department liaison at the Crit-
     ical Infrastructure Assurance Office. "It should bring that pattern recognition and
     learn as it goes...so that over time it will have the ability to recognize" not only
     attacks but what could be attacks, she said.

     Vendors have been working on this type of product, sometimes called anomaly detection,
     for some time.

     "ISS has a lot of research efforts in place to advance the intrusion-detection market,"
     said Mark Wood, intrusion-detection product manager at Internet Security Systems Inc.,
     maker of the Real-Secure intrusion-detection product line. "Having a pre-defined list of
     signatures is nice, but you'd like to detect novel attacks, things you don't know
     about."

     One major problem vendors are struggling with in producing this type of solution is the
     large number of "false positives" -- incorrectly perceived attacks -- that are generated
     when a network is scanned, Wood said. Despite this, a commercially viable solution could
     be available within the next year, he said.

     "It's certainly worthwhile that someone like the GSA is driving this; it's absolutely
     necessary," Wood said. "Perhaps this will help coordinate the industry so that they will
     provide something sooner than they would have."

     The need for this type of solution across government has been underscored by the more
     than 40 federal World Wide Web sites that have been hacked in the last two months, in-
     cluding at least six last week. And these attacks are only the most noticeable types of
     intrusions into government networks, according to federal experts testifying before
     Congress last week [see related story, "House member suggests regular network security
     reports"].

     However, in the end, while many would wish otherwise, keeping up with attackers instead
     of one step behind really is the best that anyone can do, Jarrell said. "There is no
     silver bullet; there is no perfect solution when it comes to intrusion detection," he
     said. "As I've said before, if you build a better mousetrap, a better mouse will
     evolve."

     It is a buffer overflow done in javascript. I found it on a webpage
     somewhere and i do not remember where so i am very sorry to the person
     that wrote it that i cannot list your name here cause i found this a
     while ago. Sometimes this kicker doesn't work. But we know that his
     board supports HTML so you can input this script that will redirect the
     person to another page containing the script.

     Input this into the message area:

     <html>
     <head>
     <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; URL=kicker.html">
     </head>
     <body>
     Redirecting.....
     </body></html>

     The kicker is located at the page so when the user wants to read your
     post, it will redirect them to that page wich contains that JavaScript
     code. I would reccomend just putting that refresh tag instead of the
     JavaScript tag cause the Matt Wright wwwboard comes with JavaScript
     turned off or as the defualt. So the refresh would work better and would
     have more of a chance of it to work.

     This doesn't just work with Matt Wright's wwwboards, but really any
     wwwboards that support HTML. It is just that i tested and figured out
     how this worked on a Matt Wright wwwboard.

     This is also a good trick if you have a sponser that pays by the click,
     just redirect them to your sponser....

<!-- 3.00 - Misc //-->

3.01 --=\\Neophyte Vocab\\=--

     Here is a list of vocab that I made up for the newbies. You should probably learn this
     if you are taking into consideration of being a 'computer h4x0r'. This is probably
     where you should start and the first thing you should learn before anything else. I put
     them in alphabetical order (finally learned how to do that!)

     *Words & Descriptions:

     31337 - see elite.
     box - basically the OS or your computer.
     buffer overflow - tries to 'overflow' some part of a server (see exploit & server).
     dns - domain name server. Changes xx.xx.xxx.x to yourdomain.com (brief description).
     dos - denial of service; something to slow a computer down (see nuke & ping).
     computer - a television set with buttons and a rodent attached to it.
     elite - the best at something who can make no mistakes at that something.
     exploit - a security hole (in a server, web browser, anything).
     ftp - file transfer protocol. Used to transer files (upload and/or download).
     ftpd - ftp daemon (see ftp server & ftp).
     ftp server - a server used to allows people to ftp to it (see ftp).
     http - hypertext tranfser protocol. Allows you to view the persons webpage.
     httpd - http daemon (see http & http server).
     http server - a server that allows people to surf/view your site.
     lamer - someone that tries to understand hacking and doesn't.
     linux - an operating system that is like a "sub-operating system" of unix (see unix).
     local exploit - an exploit that only works on 127.0.0.1 or "local host" (see exploit).
     nuke - sends large packets to a computer causing a dos (see dos).
     passwd - where all of the usernames and passwords are stored on a unix box (see unix).
     passwd cracker - program used for cracking passwd files (see passwd & wordlist).
     ping - sends 'x' number of packets to a computer and sees how fast they get there.
     port scanner - program used for scanning various ports on a computer (see computer).
     remote exploit - an exploit that can be used on any IP (see exploit).
     rm -rf */ - unix command to delete everything on the server (see unix).
     root - the username to a unix box. The person that has super user privlages.
     script kiddie - someone that uses other peoples exploits or that weren't made by them.
     server - where you go when you type in a site URL and upload to a site (basic descrip.)
     shell account - a user account on a unix box (see unix).
     unix - the operating system that MOST servers are run on (see server).
     warez - giving away or re-selling already used copyrighted material.
     windowsNT - another operating system that a lot of servers run on (see server).
     wordlist - file w/ generated words, for cracking passwd files (see passwd cracking).

     *Sayings & Descriptions:

     I like your computer - means he likes your rodent/rat.
     I got root - means someone gained root on a server.
     I got a shell account - means someone got a user account on a unix server/computer.
     I used the IMAPD exploit - means that he used the IMAPD security glitch to gain access.

     Ok I hope your starting to understand the 'sayings' and how to understand the vocab
     when they are put into sentances.

     *Programs & misc:

     passwd cracking - John the Ripper, pass crack
     port scanner - 7th Sphere port scanner, Hackers Utility
     wordlist generators - Dictionary Generator v1.0 (dic-gen), passlist
     shell accounts - www.cyberspace.org, www.shellyeah.com, www.freeshells.net

     All of these programs can be found on my site (www.thepoison.org), and a lot more of
     them. These are just some of the programs that I use when I am in windows and to lazy
     to reboot into RH5.2 (RedHat 5.2).
