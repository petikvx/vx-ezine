>>1) How did you start out in computers?

It was about 1982... it was the time of 8bit computers like Sinclair's
ZX-Spectrum... I started coding video-games, but i left this coz i had to
study...

>>2) How long have you been active in the virus-scene?

I was interested on viruses for long time before i decided to
code one... I released my first virus in 1996

>>3) From where did you get you handle, GriYo?

Griyo comes from the spanish word "grillo" wich means cricket...

>>4) First your virus?

My first virus was CRICRI ... It was a MsDos file infector, with
umb residency, full stealth and polymorphic...

>>5) As you consider what the most best your virus?

My best virus? Well... hard to decide... SuckSexee (aka Implant)
might be the most complete one... but i like them all coz they're
my babies ;D

>>6) How do you name your viruses?

I just choose a name i like... now i decided to name all my Win32
viruses using the name of some biological virus, such as Marburg or
HPS...

>>7) Which programming languages do you know?

The number of languages is not too important... when you know the
basics of software engineering you can code in any language...

To the date i've worked using the following languages:

C and C++
Pascal, Cobol, Modula and Fortran (at uni;)
Assembler (for Zilog Z80, for Motorola 680x0 series and for Intel 80x86
family of course...
Visual Basic (just to write quickly some programs at work).
And a long list of pseudolanguages and other shit such as Java, HTML,
Delphi, SQL, Lingo, blah, blah, blah...

>>8) What most of all programme language you like?

C++ is my favorite... no doubt.

>>10) What E-zine you most of all like?

Leaving 29A apart, i guess. Well, i spent lots of hours reading VLAD...
but you know, nothing lasts forever... nowadays i have no favorite
mag... or maybe iKx's Xine.

>>13) What viruswriting you most of all respect?

Virus writer? mmm... this is really hard! i like Jacky Qwerty because
of his researches inside the Win32 platform... he helped me a lot in
some of my viruses...

>>14) What is 29A?

29A is one of the most important virus writing groups nowadays.
Check our website at http://www.29A.org for further information
and to download our viruses and issues of our e-zine as well. Also
have a look at my personal webpage at http://www.29A.org/griyo.

>>15) What's 29A goal?

We are virus researches... our goal is to learn and improve our skills.
We try to be the first in everything, and that's something we use to get.

>>16) What does it take to become a 29A member?

Well, i dont know... Im not the organizer... ask MrSandman ;D

>>17) How is 29A organized?

We usually talk about our projects on IRC or by mail... we help each
other to research, code, or test our work... 29A is like a big family, but
each member lives in a different corner of the planet...
.... although most of the spanish 29Aers live in Madrid, so we use to
meet in person, we're actual friends.

>>18) When is planned to output 29A E-zine #3?

Dunno, you know, with these things you never can tell... we're working
hard as always, but i don't have the slightest idea about the date in
which we'll release 29A#3.

>>20) What AV you consider best?

Mmmm... none... most of them are lame... just go to McAfee's or
Symantec's websites and check out their virus descriptions... these
lamers call "no memory resident direct action infector" a VxD based
virus... lame...

>>21) What do you do on your spare time?

During the week i work as a coder... during the weekend i work as a
DJ... during the night my gf "sucks" my whole time... hehe, there's no
spare time.

>22) Any advice to people who want's to learn the basic of
virus-writing?

Yes... If you like system programming go ahead... and dont forget to
read 29A  ;D

>23) Your plans on waking?

Life is random... No long time plans...
