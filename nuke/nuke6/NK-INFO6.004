% IRIS R9.1.3A Introduction %
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hello Everybody, I would like to know what has happened to the hacking world.
Now it's basically dead, at least in most areas I know of. I hope to change
that. Anyways, Here is some info on a relatively old System called IRIS or
Interactive Realtime Information Service. This system was originally meant
to run on older systems like PDP-8 and PDP-11. Due to the versatile nature
of IRIS, today a lot more systems run it. IRIS systems usually can be reached
at 1200 7E1 and after pressing either ESCape or Enter a few times, you should
see something like this as a greet:
-=-
Welcome to "IRIS" R9.1.3A timesharing !

ACCOUNT ID ?
-=-
Or sometimes it will say what you have reached under the welcome line. IRIS
is also extremely hacker-friendly as it will let you type account names for 
as long as you want. Also when you guess an account there are no passwords on
them. At first you will not see what you type, to change this type Control-E
to turn the echo on. Try CAPSLOCK also.
-=-

DEFAULT ACCOUNTS
----------------

MANAGER (Good System Access)
NO NAME (Normal User)
DEMO (Try the other ones first)
PDP8     /
PDP11   < == All General Accounts
SOFTWARE \

Hopefully you're in there with one of those accounts. Now, then you will get
a # prompt. If you are on with an account of access level 3, then you will
be able to use a user maintanencer program, by typing either ACCOUNTS or
ACCOUNT UTILITY. You should get:
-=-

 (0) EXIT TO SYSTEM
 (1) ADD NEW ACCOUNT
 (2) MODIFY ACCOUNT
 (3) DELETE ACCOUNT
 (4) INQUIRE ACCOUNT
 (5) LIST THE ACCOUNTS

Ah, I wasn't able to create an account, but I did modify several. Basically
this is pretty straight forward.
-=-
Ok, after you're done playing with the accounts and exit properly there are 
a lot of interesting features on this IRIS. On one particular system that I
use often you have several utilities such as spreadsheets, word processors 
and even an ASM program. You can get a list of all the things to do by typing
LIBR at the # prompt. most of the filenames you type the response will be 
"NOT A PROCESSOR", Since most of the IRIS software was written is business
BASIC. Type BASIC LOAD <Filename>. Here are some of the most interesting 
programs.

PP or PORT ALL MONITOR will let you see who else is using the system. if 
for some reason you want to kick off a user, type PPP and then the user name.
Also if you want to see your own status type PROT.STAT

If you need help with something try typing GUIDE and it will give you a short
menu of all the help files available. Too bad there usually isn't many.

Another interesting utility to use is BLOCKCOPY, since I am not completely
used to it, I will show you what the guide said:

INTERACTIVE PROGRAM GUIDE ON SETTING UP BLOCKCOPY

INTRODUCTION

BLOCKCOPY IS A STAND-ALONE UTILITY PROGRAM WHICH GIVES GREAT
FLEXIBILITY IN COPYING ANY PART OF ONE DISC TO ANY PART OF
ANOTHER, EVEN ONTO A DIFFERENT DISC CONTROLLER.
BLOCKCOPY DOES NOT PROVIDE FAST PERFORMANCE, BUT IT CAN BE VERY
USEFUL IN SPECIAL CASES.  EXAMPLES:

1) YOU CAN COPY A SINGLE LOGICAL UNIT FROM ONE PACK TO ANOTHER,
   WITHOUT OVERWRITING OTHER LOGICAL UNITS ALREADY ON THE
   DESTINATION.

2) IF YOU HAVE BOTH LARGE STORAGE MODULES AND SMALLER CARTRIDGE
   DRIVES ON THE SAME SYSTEM, YOU CAN BACKUP YOUR SYSTEM LOGICAL
   UNIT 0 FROM STORAGE MODULE ONTO A CARTRIDGE PACK WHICH CAN
   BE SET ASIDE AS A DEDICATED SYSTEM BACKUP.

3) IF YOU HAVE A SPECIAL SWAPPING DISC, IT CAN BE BACKED
   UP TO AND RESTORED FROM OTHER STORAGE MODULES.


PRESS RETURN WHEN READY TO GO ON 

LIMITATIONS

NOTE THAT WHILE YOU CAN COPY FROM ONE TYPE OF DISC CONTROLLER
TO ANOTHER, THE RESULT MAY NOT BE INSTALLABLE UNDER
IRIS BECAUSE OF SOME DISC ADDRESS CONSIDERATIONS.

ALSO NOTE THAT YOU MAY NOT SPECIFY A DESTINATION WHICH
PHYSICALLY OVERLAPS THE SOURCE ON THE SAME PACK.
SETUP

FIRST, HAVE AT HAND YOUR R9.0 PERIPHERALS HANDBOOK.
NOTICE THAT FOR EACH TYPE OF DISC, THERE IS A DIFFERENT VALUE
FOR THE BZUD POINTER.
ALSO NOTICE THAT IT GIVES YOU FORMULAS TO COMPUTE VALUES CALLED PHYU.
FIND THE APPROPRIATE DISC SPECIFICATION SHEET(S) DESCRIBING
YOUR SOURCE (WHERE YOU ARE COPYING BLOCKS FROM) AND YOUR
DESTINATION (WHERE YOU ARE COPYING BLOCKS TO).  THE SOURCE
AND DESTINATION DO NOT HAVE TO BE THE SAME TYPE OF CONTROLLER.


PRESS RETURN WHEN READY TO GO ON 


NOTE: ALL REQUESTED VALUES/CALCS IN OCTAL UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.
      ALL VALUES ON DISC SPECIFICATION SHEETS ARE IN OCTAL.


ENTER THE FOLLOWING VALUES FOR THE SOURCE:

                         ADDRESS OF THE SOURCE BZUD : 0
                      COMPUTED VALUE OF SOURCE PHYU : 0
                           STARTING CYLINDER NUMBER : 0
BLOCK # IN THE CYL TO START COPYING FROM (ORIGIN 0)
                               THIS IS NORMALY ZERO : 0
                    SOURCE CONTROLLER'S DEVICE CODE : 0
                                  SOURCE DISC'S LRC : 0
 NUMBER OF CYLINDERS TO COPY (REM TO GIVE IN OCTAL) : 0




ENTER THE FOLLOWING VALUES FOR THE DESTINATION:

                    ADDRESS OF THE DESTINATION BZUD : 0
                 COMPUTED VALUE OF DESTINATION PHYU : 0
                                  STARTING CYLINDER : 0
  BLOCK # IN THE CYL TO START COPYING TO (ORIGIN 0) : 0
               DESTINATION CONTROLLER'S DEVICE CODE : 0

PRINT HERE OR $LPT (C/R OR $) : 0


RUN "MAKEBLOCKCOPY", WHEN FINISHED ENTER THE FOLLOWING COMMAND:
  #SHUTDOWN <CTRL-E>[PASSWORD]<CTRL-E> BLOCKCOPY @73000,X73000

USE DBUG TO SET UP THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS:

 200 : 0 
 201 : 0 
 202 : 0 
 203 : 0 
 204 : 0 
 205 : 0 
 206 : 0 
 207 : 0 
 210 : 0 
 211 : 0 
 212 : 0 
 213 : 176346 


PRESS RETURN WHEN READY TO GO ON 0

THEN J410 (OR RESET & START AT 410) TO START THE COPY

Also you can edit individual text files and configuration files
by text editors. The names of this shit is different on all the systems
I've called.

I hope this serves a useful purpose.. I still can't understand why IRIS is
extremely easy to use, and very common.. yet, I haven't seen any good
articles on it in a very long time.
