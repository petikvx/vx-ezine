% Introduction %

Welcome to the sixth issue of this Informational Journal. With regards to
what goes on in the `modem world' utterly known as CyperSpace, NuKE has 
undergone several changes and recommendations in order to un-cloud the thoughts
and impressions, the public has towards NuKE. 

I do wish to make it clear that there has been TWO unique gatherings of a 
computer group called `NuKE'. The original founded by The Darkman, whom now
left the scene. And the seconded created by myself, Joseph Greco aka Rock 
Steady. I wish to state out, I simply relived the NuKE name, old members with 
The Darkman were evicted out of this New NuKE founded by myself, along with
Nowhere Man, Phrozen Doberman and Screaming Radish.

% What does this NuKE do? %

We are _not_ a copious group of computer virus programmers. Surely, we set a
few eminent examples that dominated the so-called `virus scene'. And surely
we have created ingenious creations that have pressured many others to 
`mimic' our moves. How lethargic and bleak can some group/person get, if they
(the so-called virus groups) have to imitate _us_ whom are here simply for 
the gain of self-knowledge? Frankly we are not solely a virus group, nor 
`teens' for that matter. We understand that all the existing `so-called' 
virus groups are kids/teens, and therefore can understand where such a label 
can originate from.

The computer industry has opened a channel of unlimited information, a gain
for self-knowledge advancements. We members/supporters of NuKE only wish to 
advance by self-knowledge advances and perhaps educate those that wish to be
educated. We need to educate the world, no more secrets, it is the only way 
we can succeed in this world. And for this we are labelled as a computer
criminals. Why is it wrong to want to learn how a computer functions internally?
Why is it wrong to show you possible loops and holes that can make a computer
system vulnerable to unauthorised access. 

There is a different class of society here in the computer world. A class that
can obtain knowledge at alarming rates. A class that seeks and lives on 
information. A class that wishes to try out new ideas, and experiment others
in order to advance intellectually. And yet the public wishes to suppress this
minority group that can be even classified as ingenious.
Surely we must not mistake those that have a destructive intent into this 
category. For I find that this type of disfigured character must be plucked out
just like a cancerous cell at its early cellular growth. 

So what does NuKE do? Together we learn, and together we experiment. I wish to
bring out the fact that every article here, has undergone extensive research,
none of it is `second-hand' news. We will not take a `Michelangelo disassembly'
when the exact recreation exist. We will not talk about `Anti-Debugger' 
routines when the exact article/examples have been seen in a text file publicly
floating around the Technodrome. We will not `mimic' anyone, or try to `look'
better than they, for the purpose that this is not a game of fame. NED was an
exceptional toolkit made in October 1992, that started with the idea of the 
Dark Avenger's MtE. NED is now publicly available today, with it's SOURCE CODES, 
and surely enough we will see _many_ "mimic-kids" producing their own based
on our trend, and make inarticulate claims that their engine was created
solely by they. Simply looking at NED will influence your style of programming.
Some unknown author in an unknown United States `so-called' virus group, has 
already recreated a shroudy example, that structurally looks exactly like 
N.E.D. 

Anyhow, it's up to you, the reader, to proclaim theses jokers out. We will 
not cloud our opinions with any emotional hatred to anyone or group. We 
believe in publishing works that are original, or state an original opinion, 
or fact.

The NEW NuKE is undergoing dramatic changes in order to help with our overall
impression. The New NuKE has even made major attempts to legalize itself 
by registering its name. However we are still undergoing through this 
legalization procedure, but do stay in tuned with the next Informational Journal
issued out mid-July 1993, which will contain our registered company name, and
number. Along with an official mailing address, (PO Box) registered to the 
NuKE name. NuKE has already made attempts to branch itself into Internet.
As we may feature a open access unix (*NIX) site, we certainly will have a mail
link to send/receive UUCP mail to our WHQ BBS. (Cybernetic Violence). 

% Ahhhh, We're on the Net %

I certainly cannot guaranty something in the making, but UUCP/Usenet connection
is a _very_ possible feature in the near future. I will not toy with you, I will
say simply that we are in the process of transforming our system(s), and looking
at all possible Unix based systems. It does look like that our choice will be
between 386BSD or Linux 0.99.7A, which feature the TCP/IP protocols to establish
a link with Internet, if that is to happen. Indeed, a Usenet feed will be made,
if our budget does not meet with Internet connection fees. We currently have
polled two 386/33Mhz PCs remotely, with a total disk space of 700 Megs and with
a CD-ROM to run the software off directly (Linux), all with three 14.4k V32Bis
modems and one 14.4k HST based modem. It will seem that we will feature an
opened Unix system. We find free informational groups such as NuKE should be
hooked up to perhaps, what is the biggest international network today.

It certainly will cut down on long distance toll charges, which seem to hover
at $500.00 monthly, hitting about $6000.00 yearly. This is Canadian Dollars,
however take into grant that Canadian long distance calls are much more cheaper
compared to our USA counter part. A one hour call originating from Canada to the
United States will cost $15.00 (Can$). Where the USA counter part will pay
closer towards $20.00 (US$), about $25.00 (Can$). The same does apply for
international calls, which tend to cost more if originating from the USA. All
in all, taking the currency exchange rate into account, that $6000.00 (Can$)
translates to $7000.000 (Can$) if originated from the USA.

I leave you to read the NuKE Informational Journal #6. If you do have any
comments that you wish to send to the Editor, Rock Steady, please do so.

If you wish to email me concerning a private matter, we feature Rock Steady's
personal public key.

% What's to come, of NuKE? %
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This Informational journal sure was `bad' timing. All to be explain in due time,
of course. But we did prolong this journal for quite a long while, due to many,
many more articles we wanted to publish. Unfortunately, time stands still for
no-one, not even for NuKE. We gathered enough information for another
Informational Journal, but the articles were somewhat incomplete, to our
standards. We received several articles from guest writers concerning Cellular
Phones, Radio Communications, and other bits and pieces. If anyone has any
additions or experiences for these topics, please do confront us.

We await to see you soon...
