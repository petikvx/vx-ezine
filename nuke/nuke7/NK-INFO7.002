With international telephone services becoming more and more integrated and
international calls becoming more and more common, it only makes sense than
calling cards would also evolve to ease international calling.  AT&T       
Calling Cards are usable to call back to the U.S. from over 170 different  
countries, and to even call *between* 46 countries outside the U.S. (called
AT&T World Connect<tm> service).  The AT&T USADirect Service<tm> is        
available in over 110 countries.  This service connects you immediately    
back to an English-speaking AT&T operator in the U.S., who will take your  
calling card number and place your call for you.  The following is the     
procedure for using USADirect:                                             
                                                                           
1. Dial the USADirect access number for the country you're calling from.   
                                                                           
2. An English-language voice prompt will ask for the telephone number      
   you are calling.  Enter the area code and seven-digit phone number.     
                                                                           
3. After the tone, enter your 14-digit AT&T Calling Card number, which     
   includes the last four digits, your PIN.  If you're calling collect,    
   press zero for an English-speaking operator.                            
                                                                           
If you are at a telephone that does not have access to automated service,  
simply wait for the English-speaking AT&T operator to greet you. To call   
from country to country using World Connect<tm> service, please wait for   
the AT&T operator to assist you.  The operator will ask for your AT&T      
Calling Card number and place the international call for you.  To place    
additional calls, press # after your party hangs up and follow the voice   
prompts.                                                                   
                                                                           
To call 800 numbers, ask the AT&T operator to connect you.  Unfortunately, 
she will only connect calls to AT&T 800 customers...however, this USADirect
service can be used by people who live outside the U.S. to reach 800       
numbers.  You don't need to have an AT&T Calling Card to do this.          
                                                                           
Use your regular AT&T Calling Card number, not the international number.   
To learn more about USADirect service, call (800) 331 1140 ext. 406 from   
the U.S., or call collect to +1 412 553 7458 ext. 806 from abroad.

Notice that most numbers include 011, the international dialing prefix in  
the U.S. and Canada, or 288, "ATT" on the telephone keypad...  Note that
Canada is not included in the list since AT&T Calling Cards can be used in 
Canada the same way they are used in the U.S. (0+NPA+NXX-XXXX or placed    
through the operator).  The following countries will accept AT&T Calling   
Cards, but access to USADirect is restricted to special phones at certain  
places that Americans tend to congregate (hotels, airports, rail stations, 
etc.):  Barbados, Ethiopia, Mexico, Qatar, Romania, St. Lucia, Seychelles  
Islands, Sierra Leone, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos, Uganda, and  
Yemen.                                                                     
                                                                           
AT&T USADirect is an easy way to call the U.S. from abroad.  Of course,    
you have to have an AT&T Calling Card to use the service...  Happily, AT&T 
will issue calling cards to people who do not use AT&T long distance       
service, including people who do not live in the USA.  Call (800) 525 7955 
for more information on obtaining an AT&T Calling Card outside the U.S. (or
call (800) 222 0300 if you want to obtain a calling card billed to your    
U.S. home phone line).

You can obtain one for yourself (they're free) by calling (800) 874 4000   
and asking for it.
