% An E-Z Guide to Remote UNIX Disk Mounting %

Remote disk mounting on UNIX systems requires root access on the base      
system.  The procedure is as follows:                                      
                                                                           
1. Create a temporary directory (/tmp/lame in this example).               
2. Query target with "showmount -e host.addr.addr".                        
                                                                           
     This will illuminate you as to which (if any) filesystems may be      
     mounted from your machine.  It will reply with:                       
                                                                           
           hostname:/directory/directory  -options                         
                                                                           
     where options are the mounting options (rw, ro), who may access       
     (host1:host2:...) and other sundry niceities.                         
                                                                           
     showmount -e hostname uses mountd on the remote to read the remote's  
     /etc/exports.                                                         
                                                                           
     If your machine is listed in the access field, or if access reads     
     "everyone," you may mount that filesystem.                            
                                                                           
3. Pick a filesystem you would like to mount.  Remember that you can       
   mount the subdierctories of the mountable directories.                  
                                                                           
4. Mount the filesystem.                                                   
     mount hostname:/filesystem/remote /tmp/lame                           
                                                                           
5. Do whatever you want with the filesystem.                               
                                                                           
6. Unmount the filesystem.                                                 
     umount /tmp/lame  OR  #umount hostname:/filesystem/remote             
                                                                           
REMEMBER:                                                                  
     - You must leave the directory you are unmounting.                    
     - ALL mounts (failed or successful) are noted in /etc/rmtab on        
       the remote system.  /etc/rmtab remains until purged.                
     - You must specify full pathnames when mounting and unmounting.       
                                                                           
MORE:                                                                      
     - An entry of "/filesystem/directory       " with no options in       
       a host's /etc/exports will allow world-mounting of that system.     
     - Remote mounting often uses RPC and NFS.  It will work most          
       often on Suns and workstations networked with Suns (ie: using NFS).
