        This file contains the entries of uncommon or rare explosives.
By this, it is meant that the following compounds have explosive properties, 
but are not used as commercial/military explosives and/or they are generally 
unknown to the public.  They may not be used as commercial/military
explosives for a number of reason, some of which may be:  lack of stability,
cost of materials, difficulty of synthesis, cost of synthesis, toxicity, etc.
The general format of the compound entries will be as follows:

Entry:                  Entry Number
Name:                   Common Name
IUPAC Name:             IUPAC Designated Name
Condensed Formula:      Molecular Formula / Structural Condensed Formula
Physical Properties:    Some physical properties of the explosive
Explosive Properties:   The explosive properties of the compound
Manufacture:            The manufacturing procedure, and lab preparation
                        procedure (if given)
Use:                    The use
Toxicity (if known):    Toxicity, and side effects if known

NOTE:  Most of the following compounds are highly dangerous.  Due to this
       fact, this article has been written for the knowledge of the 
       explosives rather than the experience of making them.  Thus, the
       manufacture of each explosive compound will not be given in a step
       by step "how to" fashion, but rather just the bare minimum reactant
       chemicals (if given).  The author holds no responsibility for the
       way any individual, or group uses the following information.

        Being interested in explosives as I am, and not seeing any
new files on explosives (or new explosives themselves), I decided to
write this file, based on a huge chemistry reference manual containing
more than 10,000 chemical compounds.  I hope many others will find it as
useful as I have.

        The elimination process for chemicals occured as follows:        
                
        (1) Any chemicals that are commonly known to the public were 
        eliminated.  Examples are 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT),
        1,2,3-Propanetriol trinitrate (nitroglycerin), and 
        cellulose hexanitrate (guncotton).

        (2) Any chemicals that were listed or described in any other file
        i have seen were eliminated.  Examples are ammonium tri-iodide,
        acetone peroxide, and mercury fulminate.  I gave the picric acid
        salts, and a few other explosives, an exception to this rule
        because I think they are important explosives.

        (3) The chemical has to be explosive by itself, not a redox or other
        type of reaction (e.g. dust/particle explosion, or gas/combustible
        explosion).  This eliminated chemicals such as potassium
        permanganate.  I gave the chemicals ethyl ether, and isopropyl ether
        an exception to this rule as they form an unknown explosive peroxide
        readily that conforms to all other rules.

        Any compounds that passed the three processes are included in this
        file.  I regret any N/A's (not available) and will try to find
        the missing information in the future.

Condensed Formula:      CH2N2 / CH2=(N+)=(N-)
Physical Properties:    Yellow gas.  mp -145 c, bp -23 c.  Copper powder and
                        solid calcium chloride causes active decomposition
                        with the evolution of nitrogen and the formation of
                        insoluble white flakes of polymethylene (CH2)ü.
Explosive Properties:   The undiluted liquid and concentrated solutions may
                        explode violently, especially if impurities are 
                        present.  Gaseous diazomethane may explode on heating
                        to 100 c or on rough glass surfaces.  Alkali metals
                        also produce explosions with diazomethane.

                        with potassium hydroxide; from KOH and nitrosomethyl-

                        following procedures yield ether solutions of 
                        diazomethane.  From N-nitroso-á-methylaminoisobutyl
                        methyl ketone in ether and isopropanol by reaction
                        with sodium isopropoxide or from the same ketone in
                        ether by reaction with sodium cyclohexoxide.  In the
                        laboratory diazomethane may be prepared most simply
                        by the action of alkali on the commercially available
                        N-methyl-N-nitroso-N'-nitroguanidine.
Use:                    Powerful methylating agent for acidic compounds such
                        as carboxylic acids, phenols, enols.
Toxicity (if known):    Very toxic.  Insidious poison (a well ventilated hood
                        is absolutely necessary), avoid vapor.  Strong 
                        irritant.  Does not cause discernible reaction at the
                        time of contact, but later even in minute amounts,
                        produces an inflammatory reaction.  Hypersensitivity
                        results which makes it impossible to work with 
                        diazomethane without attacks of asthma and associated
                        symptoms.

                        green color).

                        1.85 volume-% of ether vapor are explosive hazards.

Name:                   Tetrasulfur Tetranitride
IUPAC Name:             Tetrasulfur Tetranitride
Condensed Formula:      N4S4
Physical Properties:    Orange-red, monoclinic needles.  mp 178 c.  Insoluble
                        in cold water.  Slightly soluble in benzene.
Explosive Properties:   Heating above 185 c may result in deflagration and
                        explosion.  May decompose explosivly on striking
                        or at tempatures much above 100 c.
Manufacture:            Prepared by the interaction of disulfur dichloride 
                        and ammonia.

Physical Properties:    Crystals, mp 15 c.  Decomposes above 25 c.  Soluble
                        in water, giving an intense yellow solution, although
                        the dry crystals are pure white.
Explosive Properties:   Explodes when heated rapidly.
Manufacture:            Prepared by nitration of acetylene with nitric acid.
                        Prepared from tetranitromethane and K4[Fe(CN6)] in
                        an aqueous solution.

Name:                   Uranyl Nitrate
IUPAC Name:             Uranyl Nitrate
Condensed Formula:      N2O8U / UO2(NO3)2
Physical Properties:    Hexahydrate, yellow crystals; greenish luster by
                        relected light.  When shaken, rubbed, or crushed,
                        the crystals show remarkable tribolum inescence with
                        occasional detonations.
Explosive Properties:   Solutions should not be allowed to stand in sunlight
                        as explosions may occur.  Shaking, rubbing, or
