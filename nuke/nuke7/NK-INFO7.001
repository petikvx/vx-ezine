IJ#6 Errata
~~~~~~~~~~~
Unfortunately several mistakes were made in NuKE InfoJournal #6.
Article #4 ("IRIS Guide") was written by Nitro-187, not Ned-239 as
indicated in some copies of the InfoJournal.  In article #2 ("A Guide to
the North American Numbering System"), by Nowhere Man, the non-published
number percentage chart should list Bakersfield, California as being in
area code 805.  We apologize for any inconvenince to our readers or
writers.


Two Years Of NuKE!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This month marks the second year of NuKE's existance!  NuKE was founded
in August 1991 as an H/P group local to 514 (Montreal, Canada).  Since
then NuKE has matured and evolved in to an international pro-virus
group with a worldwide network and many inovative products.  Two
years may not seem like much, but there have been very few "groups"
that have lasted this long...


News From Europe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NuKE now has four sites in Europe, adding Land of Lost Souls in
Sofia, Bulgaria (sysop:  Winnie the Pooh).  Winnie is working on adding
sites in the former USSR and other parts of Eastern Europe.  Savage
Beast reports that sites are under consideration in Spain; he is unable
to add any French sites because of overzealous computer crime laws in
that country.  A Belgian site is on the way, too.  Besides Land of Lost
Souls, NuKE maintains three boards in Switzerland, one in the French-
speaking areas and two in the German-speaking areas.  NuKE's European branch
is finally growning again after the closing of several of its sites due
to hardware problems, personal difficulties, and police raids.


NuKE Site Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cybernetic Violence, NuKE's world headquarters, now has a new number.      
It can be reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at +1 514 426 9194.        
The old number is no longer valid!  Cybernetic Violence (sysop:  Pure      
Energy) is located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and runs 24 hours/day      
7 days/week at 14.4k v.32bis.  Cybernetic Violence is also the central
hub of NuKENet.
                                                                           
The Hell Pit (sysop:  Hades), located in Chicago, Illinois, USA, has
upgraded its modem and is now running at 14.4k v.32bis.  The Hell Pit
can be reached 24 hours/day 7 days/week at +1 708 459 7267.

                                                                           
New 500 Area Code                                                          
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                          
In July 1993 Bellcore, the agency designated to assign area codes          
and exchanges (NXXs) for the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean,              
announced that starting sometime in August (pending U.S. government        
approval) it will allocate numbers in the 500 NPA for use by               
personal communication services.  Exchanges will be handed out             
to corporations if they show a real need -- already AT&T and               
Atlantic Bell have asked for exchanges.  In the future, NPA 500            
will probably also be used for cellular phones, pagers, and other          
mobile services.                                                           
                                                                           
                                                                           
Quelle Horrible!  Rock Steady French?!                                     
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                     
In an interview done by Netta Gilboa of _Gray Areas_ Magazine              
(an excellent publication, highly recommended) with Urnst Kouch,           
published in Gray Areas no. 3 and reprinted in Computer Underground Digest 
vol. 5 no. 44, Urnst Kouch states in error that "Rock Steady is            
French-Canadian."  We here at NuKE would like to make it very clear that   
Rock Steady is not French, never was French, and never will be French.     
Not everyone who lives in Quebec is a Francophone...                       
                                                                           
                                                                           
NuKENet -- One Year Old And Still Growing!                                 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                 
This summer marks the first anniversary of the creation of NuKENet.        
NuKENet began in mid-1992 as a mail link between Cybernetic Violence
in Canada and Total Mayhem in Australia.  It has since grown into          
a huge multinational network with sites in Europe, Africa, Australia,      
and North America.  In fact, NuKENet can now be reached via the FidoNet    
backbone at NUKE_THEWORLD -- request it today!                             
                                                                           
Interested in joining NuKENet?  We'd be happy to have you, *if* you're     
the right kind of system...  Boards wishing to join NuKENet should         
contact a net administrator; if that's not possible, mail any NuKE member
or supporting sysop for information.

Area Split For Alabama                                                     
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                     
On July 22, 1993 South Central Bell announced that Alabama will become     
the first state to gain an interchangable (NXX) area code.  In 1995 area   
code 205 will split; Huntsville and Birmingham will remain in 205, while   
Montgomery and Mobile will move to area code *334*.  More details
will be published as they become available.                                
                                                                           
The following chart summerizes the remaining North American area code      
splits:

Trick Of The Month                                                         
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                         
Special thanks to Vest from 708 for an intresting tidbit of information --
spent three volt lithium batteries (model number CR-2032) will register    
as nickles in coin-operated vending machines!  Use old, exhausted          
batteries only, though, since new batteries are around US$2.00 each...     
This has only been tested in the U.S., but the CR-2032 is even closer      
in circumference and weight to the Canadian nickle.  If you call around, you
might be able to pick up bags of spent batteries for "recycling."  Note:
this information is for informational purposes only, and is meant to alert
owners of coin-operated devices so that such fraudulent acts might be      
detected and prevented.


Tough Swiss Anti-Piracy Laws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In response to rampant piracy throughout the country the Swiss government
has enacted tough new anti-piracy laws that force people convicted of
using pirated software to name the person(s) providing the software or
face additional penalties.  In Switzerland piracy has been particularly
bad, with most businesses using pirated software and some huge pirate
boards charging up to US$500 for unlimited access to copyrighted programs.
Viruses are not affected by the new law:  possessing and creating viruses
are still legal in Switzerland.


Anti-Virus Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Savage Beast has conducted experiments with various anti-virus products
and has concluded that "a lot of them only look good...they're really
shit."  No surprise there...however Savage has provided us with scientific
data to back up his claims.  Below are the results of scanning with the
latest versions (as of July 1993) of various virus scanners -- judge for
yourself:

Product     Maker          Virus Tested  Virus Found  MTE Tested  MTE Found
~~~~~~~     ~~~~~          ~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~
SCAN 106    McAfee                 2547         2075         200        200
M.S. AV     Microsoft              2547         1500         200          0
F-Prot      F. Skulason            2547         2253         200        200
XScan       Anyware                2547         2151         200        200
C.P. AV     Central Point          2547         1700         200          0
Norton AV   Symantec               2547         1566         200          3
HackBuster  H&B                    2547         1776         200          0
ViruSafe    Heliashim              2547         1896         200          0

As you can see, even the "best" products (F-Prot, XScan, SCAN) will miss
between 15% and 20% of current viruses.  Even if you think your computer
is "protected" from viruses you can still get a virus from one out of five
infected programs...and that's not counting MTE-using viruses -- only three
of the scanners provide acceptable protection against the Mutation Engine,
which has been out for over two and a half years.  Each time you put a
new disk in your floppy drive, ask yourself if this might be the "1 in 5."
