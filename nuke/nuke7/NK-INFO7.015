NuKE InfoJournal #7
August 1993


% To sara gordon Or Not To sara gordon, That Is The Question %

In a previous NuKE Informational Journal (#6), we had published an editorial
by Rock Steady concerning the "know-about" and experiences that Rock Steady
has encountered with Ms. Sara Gordon. To our surprise [yeah, right], Ms.
Gordon denied several statements we had written about her, so we at
NuKE asked Sara to write us a response pertaining to that article so we
could publish it in the upcoming InfoJournal.

What you are about to read is the actual letter Ms. Gordon send us, untouched
and unedited. The reason for this is so that Miss Gordon can comprehend that
we in NuKE have no intention to bad-mouth anyone, nor will we let our emotional
judgement cloud our writing. This "Information Journal" *is* factual hard-core
information, and nothing less.

I want you to read the following two captures. One is the reply from Ms.
Gordon. The second is a _private_ reply from Ms. Gordon to John Buchanan
(ARiSToTLE).

All sentences beginning with ">" are quotes from the original article in the
previous IJ. The rest are Ms. Gordon's comments (and her vivid imagination).
All sentences in brackets are comments by Rock Steady and NuKE.


% Capture #1 -- Sara Gordon's Official Reply to NuKE %

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
i've been sent your6 info journal (not by one of your own people this time),
and wanted to comment on something in it:
the comments are both to you and to the fellow who wrote these quotations:

>Get the picture? Yes, we all heard it before, I'm a deranged lair. The Anti-
>Virus community is _not_ maniacal to associate themselves with us. We all
>heard of Sara Gordon screaming out, `I never called an underground exchange
>board', she will never admit it. Nevertheless Sara Gordon holds the phone

i do not say i have never called an underground exchange board. why, in
our conversation last night i told you i -have- call them, to talk to the
sysops and virus authors. i have called on at least 10 of them (not many,
i know), that deal strictly with viruses. some in u.s.a., some not. i don't
upload viruses to them. i don't call them to 'spy' on what is going on there.
usually i call if i'm invited. i've talked about calling them in several
articles. why would you think i would deny this.

[10 times? 10 to what power? Don't upload viruses to them?! But you do upload
 viruses to the so-called AV, right? The AV is the cause of all the viruses
 out there, not us.]

and i don't scream. thats the radish's job. and, i use my real name when i
am the one calling. why, sometimes even other people call using my real
name :).

[You don't scream? Hmm, you sound calm enough -- I wondered what happened
 in the next capture!]

however, if by association, you mean, do i do the same things you do, the
answer is i do not; at least, i don't write and distribute computer viruses,
or hacking/phreaking/carding information.

[True, we don't harass people, or try to "double-dare" them to do vengeful
 acts for you. What's this now, you DON'T distribute computer viruses? Not
 even to the AV? Come on you know that _is_ a lie. Sara, we _don't_ suspect
 you of distributing viruses, we _KNOW_ you  do. It's been proven by our
 receiving of viruses... If you must lie, please make them more believable,
 put in some statistics in 'em sentences, at least it'll be partially right.]

>number of Cybernetic Violence, Black Axes, The Hell Pit, etc. Sara doesn't

of course i've called black axis. or it is axes now? and, i've talked to 
kato at the hell pit a few times. voice, even, after the ridiculous phrack
article. i think its been over a year now though since i've called him,
or he has called me.

[I know you have. I also know your "Dark Avenger article" was the best scam
 ever. ]<0oL YoU'rî ¤0w éNä 0f £s!]

ive never called cybernetic violence that i can remember, i think i -may-
have it in an overhead slide for a presentation, but i've not called it.

i told you this last night. 'holds the phone number of'...gee, so does the
phone company. and probably every law enforcement agency in the world.

[Gee, Sara, but you seem so damn proud to tell people that you hold the
 numbers...]

>associate herself with low-lives like ourselves, as she explains. Nevertheless
>she has CLAIMED to have called up The Hell Pit BBS, and uploaded 3 fake viruses
>and exclaims how easy it was to obtain virus access there. Now there's a 

wait. what exactly are you talking about here? can you please explain

[Oops, memory lapse!]

this? it -is- easy to obtain access there. and yes, three dummy viruses were
uploaded there to prove this point. it was a (very small) part of some
research data gathered to illustrate that the real problem of virus exchange
bbs was not the -viruses- but was the attitudes being presented and tossed
about. why, screaming radish, you agreed with me just last night on the 
phone (when you called me) that a lot of those people are putting out 
attitudes that -are- the problem.

[Our point exactly, and now your stealing our ideologies. You seem nice and
 calm in this message, but that is because you _know_ that this article
 was to be published, but what about articles you don't expect published?
 Are you this well-bred in them? I think not, as we reveal your private
 e-mail in the next capture.  BTW, any security flaws at the Hell Pit have
 been fixed long ago...there's no way she could get in now without a real
 virus.]

as far as not associating with what you call 'low lives like ourselves',
don't be silly. i never said i dont associate with anyone, i don't call
virus exchange bbs and upload computer viruses, because i think that once
i would let a virus out of my control, i would have done an irresponsible
thing.

[You didn't seem so distressed by helping to distribution of NED amongst
 the AV. Remember the AV _are not_ better than us. They are not above the
 law, and they don't have "better" morals then we do. They _think_ they
 do, but deep down its that money they wants. And they'll do whatever it
 takes to get it! Hmmm, capitalism, ain't it charm. Then you wonder why we
 wish to be anonymous, we have lives...]

i've never called anyone a low life that i can recall. you are that one who 
keeps using that term regarding yourself. i know only a small portion of your
lives, and wouldn't begin to judge you. i only say that certain actions
of virus writers are irresponsible; those actions i can judge because i've
seen the consequences of them

[You can't recall? Humms, memory lapse (again), common in elderly women,
 isn't it?]

>contradiction.  Now who are you going to believe?  Rock Steady, with a record for
>hacking, and suspected of other cyber-crimes, or Sara Gordon with not even a
>bug-stain on her record?  Wait, let me tell you some more.  Sara Gordon is not
>totally `white', since Sara doesn't associate herself with `us', I guess the
>conversation we had concerning her wanting to invite a person called `Nowhere
>Man' to dinner was a figment of my imagination.  Also, the crap she said to me,

of course i associate with you.  why would you ever think i would say i
don't.  i did want to invite nowhere man to dinner.  why not?  ive had
dinner with far more proficient virus writers and hackers than him
:) seriously, why would you think i would be 'ashamed' of this?

[WAIT! Now you associate with me? This memory lapse thing is much more
 serious than I thought! A word of advice when lying, Sara, try sticking to
 ONE and ONLY ONE fabrication, don't start combining it with memory lapse
 and then other stories. Hell, why would you be ashamed of associating
 yourself with me. I _can't_ think of any reason!?! This associating
 think scares me, I think its time NuKE chips in and gets you a man,
 unless of course that isn't your preference! (No offence intended.)]

[Well, Sara, name those "more proficient virus writers" you've "eaten" (69?)
with.  Perhaps your sweetheart, Dark Avenger?  I can see it now, a bottle of
wine, some roses, that charming Slavic accent...head over heels I tell you.
See Rock, she is straight, after all!  BTW, I have never claimed to be a
hacker.  I am not a hacker, and I resent being associated with hacking, which
is an (wrongfully) illegal activity in most areas, whereas virus writing is
not -- and I don't support illegal activities.  I dunno, I bet her memory
problems is caused by some new virus from Bulgaria...a sexually transmitted
one. :-)  -NM]
 
i don't know what your problem is with me.  i run a free bbs to give out
information on viruses and security.  i write articles that bring the
positions of both sides into the public eye.

[You bring the positions of both sides? Right...]

im really quite tired of being quoted for things ive never said.  get
this straight--i do not find any problem with writing a computer virus.

[Uh-oh, that memory problem again...]

it's code.  what is the problem, at least as i see it, is the
irresponsible act of letting that code out of your control.  as i said
to SR, if you let people d/l viruses from your bbs, you are helping to
increase the problem.  you're helping to add to the already shaking
trust situation that exists out there.  well, since your last journal said
this is your goal, to eliminate every last piece of user trust in anti-virus
software (you specified frisk and mcafee, i think), i guess you are
accomplishing your goal.  congratulations.  personally, i think its
irresponsible, and not only that, you are helping some of the
anti virus product developers who do prey on the same fears to keep
right on taking advantage of the innocent users.

[So what are you going to do? Outlaw Viruses to "regular" people? And only
 AVers will be able to hold virus collections? That's almost like racism. What
 makes you better than us? We do this for the intellectual challenge, we don't
 seek money, we only teach those that wish to be taught! We also teach
 awareness, truth, reality. At least we agree about the anti-virus makers,
 making big bucks from this. But we can't bluntly make a law that is "racist,"
 you don't have to be from different ethnic groups to inflict racism you know.]

>about getting her in contact with virus writers in Australia, was a figment
>of my vivid imagination.  Come on Sara, I heard it and you said it.  Of course,
>this is simply my word against yours.  Son of a gun Sara, didn't you hear all
>them `clicking' noises during our conversation?  There was someone else on the
>line Sara!  Someone, that kept on receiving calls, and therefore he/she had to
>switch and answer the call, via MaBells `Calling Waiting' service.

oh, you recorded the calls?  i don't have call waiting, and i don't care
if whoever listens to your calls listens to mine.  yes, of course i said
it.  and yes, of course i wanted to get in contact with talon (harry
mcbungus, terminator zed, et.al).  i talk to a lot of virus writers, and
hackers.  what makes you think i would deny this?  i would not deny this
any more than i have publicly stated the errors i made when i first got
involved in the fun world of computer viruses.  i've never tried to hide
any of this.  in fact, ive had it published, in major publications, as
well as conference proceedings.  why do you think i'd try to hide my
contact with anyone?

[Of course you don't hide from contacting virus writers, it gets you alot of
 coverage, humm 4 straight issues of VNI, nice. I'm quite sure you got those
 articles laminated in wood, right? But what _measures_ will you _seek_ to 
 endure in these contacts. That is the question at stake, Sara.]

>See I guess this isn't after all, just a figment of my imagination. Since I
>conference the call, my phone bill supports the fact that TWO calls were made
>at the same time from my number!  One was to the alleged person in the
>background while the other was yours!  (Sara)

must be.  i don't exactly understand what you are talking about, but i
guess you do.  i figured you were conferencing.  hope you paid for it.
by the way, why did you try to tell me you were talon?  your accent is
definitively from montreal.

[Don't understand? Instead of memory lapse, you now conclude that you don't
 have an adequate grasp of the English language? Nice One! Hope I _paid_
 for it?! You think I'd risk calling anyone up fraudantly? That's _illegal_
 Sara, I'm sure I got tons of officials "expecting" me to do just that so
 they may get rid of me for good. Uh-uh girl, I wouldn't give anybody a
 second in the day to catch me in any illegal activity.]

its pretty rude to allow other people to listen in to conversations;
most adults wouldn't do it.  do you think its just normal and acceptable
to do it?  i don't.  however, i would not have 'denied' any inviting of
virus writers to dinner or elsewhere even if you didn't have some
'proof'.  i've clearly stated, in publication (see this months personal
computer world u.k.)  that i talk with a LOT of virus writers.

[Pretty rude? It's my word against yours. This way I got someone backing me up
 on your side. Don't expect CARO membership just yet, girl.]

>Oh yes, I'm a bored teenager derange liar wanting to bust balls. Frankly, no one
>admitted in NuKE is a teenager.  Frankly I'm currently in a respectable banking
>position, nevertheless I still am pursuing my Masters in Mathematics, and may
>this even lead to a Ph.D., of course by then I'm expected to sprout out of my
>satanic puberty stage and into adulthood.  Even though I'm way passed the legal
>adult age, may you still say its a hormone thing.  Frankly, when just is not done
>and lies are tossed over to the public, discrediting our history, with your
>influence of power.  <Yes, corruption of power> Until that day of just, until
>that day of truth comes out, then that will be the day you will get rid of me.

no one admitted in NuKe is a teenager?  better check those birth certificates...

[Lemme guess, its a _reading_ problem now? Flash me yours and I'll show you
 mine <wink, wink>.  Uh, birth certificates, I mean.]

>You see this isn't about me, this is about the you.  <The AntiVirus community>
>This isn't something you `mature out of', when do you mature out of injustice?
>In what point of life is injustice okay?

it's not ever okay.

>The Virus problem has been solved, now what about the Anti-Virus Problem?

okay, so after our talk last night i had a few ideas i wanted to talk
about with you, but if -this- is the kind of thing you are going to
print, i think probably you don't want to hear what i have to say.  i
think it seems you would rather print things you imagine.

[Trust me, if -this- is your kind of attitude, take a walk sister. No fame
 coming to you from our direction...]

%  Capture #2 -- The Juicy Part %

In the following capture from Sara Gordon, who hot-bloodedly tried to
shoot NuKE down due to our gain of public support Ms. Gordon still likes
to imagine that NuKE is a bunch of hackers intent on viral destruction. This
is as spurious as you can get, NuKE is a publicly available organization.
Anyone is free to call up our systems and request access. We have nothing to
hide, all is open. We wish to communicate with the public to a great extent.
This also is an invitation for people in ALL walks of life who may speculate
about NuKE to simply call us up! I cannot talk on behalf of every NuKENet BBS
out there, as I cannot control them, but I can speak for myself, and I invite
anyone to call the World Headquarters of NuKE, Cybernetic Violence,
+1 514 426 9194. We feature a 14.4k v.32bis US-Robotics modem, and also have
Bluewave mail installed into our BBS so that you may download/upload all
messages without having to stay online reading messages. As we too understand
that time is costly over the phone lines...

 they are not open to the public. i don't imply it. i state it quite clearly.
 so, then you will be fwding the pertinent posts to the public? i bet.
 would you like me to do it for you? c'mon john. you don't expect me to believe
 that i will have access to those echos if i call you bbs? -all- of them? ok,
 lets see. you tell me i will, and ill call and check it out.

[Notice the different attitude expressed by Miss Gordon, when she _doesn't_
 expect anyone to be reading private Netmail! Notice the hot-blooded tone
 of voice. Notice how she double dares Mr Buchanan ("c'mon john"), insinuating
 that John is afraid to post it to the public that NuKENet is available to
 anyone, which it is! As long you support NuKE ideologies, and respect what
 people have to say, then NuKENet can be easily obtained for your BBS.
 Actually I _double dare_ Ms. Gordon to pick up NuKENet and make it
 publicly available to her users! I guarantee she won't "lower herself to
 our level"!]

 JB> Also, you state that they carry posts concerning PBXing and such. To
 JB> my knowledge and extent of control, they do not exist and should they

 you know they do. and you know that i know it. so lets stop playing around,
 at least have the decency to be honest about it.

[What a <CENSORED>! She will not stop screaming! In the past, we have plucked
 out any system on NuKENet that posts any illegal material, such as PBXs!
 (Just in case Miss Gordon wonders what "illegal material" means to us.) Today,
 we still stand on that same agreement and we are happy to report that no
 such posts has made itself known on NuKENet! Sara claims she has many,
 many people that capture messages from NuKENet and bring them to her.
 Yet she has NEVER had any real proof of her phoney statement. Let's just
 face it, Sara's a FAKE!]

 JB> maker their appearance, I take EVERY action available to me to either
 JB> squelch them or cut them off at the source. It really rips my tail
 JB> when people in your position abuse the "language" of professionals

 oh please, if you make every effort to cut it off then why is it so blatantly
 still there, repeatedly? im not in any 'position'. im just a normal person
 who lives in the cyberspace, and who is sick of seeing it get all screwed up.

[Notice the attitude once more. She REFUSES to hear us out! We at NuKE under-
 stand, and have the dignity to respect any opinion Miss Gordon has to say,
 right or wrong, we have even published her reply to our previous NuKE IJ
 article, unedited! Yet, she refuses to hear us out, personally she seems to
 express a hatred towards us. And no matter what we do, Miss Gordon will
 always detest us. She complains that "virus writers" show utter hatred towards
 her. I guess they saw the _real_ Ms. Gordon, as we are witnessing in this
 private e-mail.]

i have researched what you say, john. and what you do. what you post is made
up in some cases. you want me to quote it for you? forget it. im finished
trying to help a bunch of people who want to destroy what is precious to me,
and to a lot of other people.

[No, Miss Gordon, it is _we_ whom have researched you. And not only did we not
 buy your first reply, according to the reply of NuKE IJ #6 article (that
 first reply was unbelievably bogus, as it didn't express _any_ of your 
 _real_ opinions, it only expressed the opinions you wanted the public to
 behold), nevertheless we see the true Miss Gordon here, don't we?]

if you want to talk about underlying motives of legislation, you are looking
in the wrong place, john. its the virus d00dz like nowhere man, and the rest
of the 'cute named guys (and gals) like 'pure energy', and that whole bunch
that brought this down on us. not any anti-virus 'cartel' or that other
nonsense you are talking about.

[And now she insults us!]

[Oh, I'm a "virus d00d" now Sara, eh?!  Is Dark Avenger a "virus d00d" too?
Or does that label apply only to men you don't sleep with?!  Are you trying
to imply at Pure Energy is a "gal?"  Well, I can assure you that he's not,
I've spoken with him many times, and I can assure that he is a male.  Uh oh,
maybe I shouldn't have said that, now she'll probably be after you P.E.! -NM]


JB> send you a small collection of 43 files that originated from
JB> Soloman's lab... check them out for yourself, but daggone girl, y'all
JB> ask me to stop posting these little messages, how about a tiny bit of
JB> help in this area...

if its ok by me. c'mon john. you promised to send me you viruses a long
time ago so i could use them in my evaluations project. i've been working,
doing - real - work, all this time, while you have been setting up you nuke
the world, nuke this and nuke that. i doubt youd want the general public to
see what goes on there. im so sick of it and by it that i dont even read what
those guys send me from it any more. i dont know how you can look in the
mirror after some of the stunts you pull.

[No, no, no Miss Gordon, _personally_ we don't know how _you_ can look in the
 mirror after all theses stunts _you_ pull. You only fantasize about our stunts,
 please let them be publicly known, as we have let your stunts be publicly
 known. I'm afraid you can't do it, as we don't pull "stunts."  Only you Sara.]

ill check out anything you send me, but i don't believe you anymore. not for
a minute. if you were who you say you are, and were really concerned about
the cyberspace environment, you would not say some of the things you say,
creating more confusion, accusing good decent people of things that they
don't do.

[The only confusion here is your change of attitude, Miss Gordon.]

and by the way, 'infiltrate' is not -my- word. i didn't write it and the
editor has issued a -retraction-

["Infiltrate" not your style? Right, isn't that a requisite course for those
 associated with .mil (military)! Yes, I can see it now, this is truly a
 conspiracy in the making. Can't you governmental people do anything right?]
