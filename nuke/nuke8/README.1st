[Unsigned article, "Discovery of 'Data Processing Virus Factory' in Italy"]

Rome--It was learned in Rome on 10 February that a data processing virus
"factory"--in fact, a program called VCL (Viruses Creation Laboratory),
capable of triggering a virus epidemic--was discovered in Italy.

Mr. Fulvio Berghella, deputy director-general of the Italian Institute
for Bank Data Processing Security (ISTINFORM), discovered what it takes to
enable just about anybody to fabricate data processing viruses; he told
the press that its existence had been suspected for a year and a half and
that about a hundred Italian enterprises had been "contaminated."

An investigation was launched to try to determine the origin of the program,
said Mr. Alessandro Pansa, chief of the "data processing crime" section of
the Italian police.  Several copies of VCL were found in various places,
particularly in Rome and Milan.

Producing viruses is very simple with the help of this program, but it is
not easy to find.  A clandestine Bulgarian data bank, as yet not identified,
reportedly was behind all this.  An international meeting of data processing
virus "hunters" was organized in Amsterdam on 12 February to draft a strategy;
an international police meeting on this subject will be held next week in
Sweden.

Since 1991, the number of viruses in curculation throughout the world in-
creased 500% [to] a total of about 10,000 viruses.  In Italy, it is not
forbidden to own a program of this type, but dissemination of viruses is
prosecuted.
