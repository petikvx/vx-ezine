NuKE Info-Journal #8
April 1994

The article you are about to read is, a perhaps, long and weary factual
series of events of past taking actions on a person known as Aristotle. The
purpose behind this article is somewhat momentous, but most of all it has 
been written to present to you the _whole_ gospel behind Aristotle. And the
article is solely for those whom have, perhaps, come into contact in sometime
or any other with this character called Aristotle.

To begin with, he has used several aliases in the past and present, many such
as Page, Jimmy Page, and of course his all time favourite alias, "Aristotle".
Many a times spelled with weird letter case values, indicating a fairly 
disturbed man getting high on letter cases. 

However his real name being John A. Buchanan, from photos I've seen, I'd say 
he's about medium height, somewhat cocking looking, and in his late
thirties. He's married, twice, with four kids, two from the prior marriage. 
Locating at Newport News, Virginia state, (804) 595-2672. And lives in a 
somewhat very small home in the middle of nowhere. The home is painted with 
this very ugly baby blue and white combination. I usually complain about my
bedroom being small, nevertheless its half the size of this home. This
incredibly small home is locating on 502 Hammond Street, Newport News,
Virginia state. Also the home does not pertain to Mr. Buchanan, it is being
rented by him. The owner of the home is his father-in-law. John is greatly
in debt, and from several phone calls with him, a somewhat abusive man
towards his children. 

He recently found himself a job, remember that crappy threat he'd give us
that his job was related to the 'government', and in 'computer crime' and
stuff. HAH! Well, he does not work for the government, or any law-official
body, nor does he possess any power. The company is named "Info. Technology
Solutions", and is located on  2551 East Elthoma Suite #0, and the public
office number is (804) 857-6000, John can _surely_ be reached there,
during business hours.

I can proceed and continue John's full CBI, but this is not intended, I
only wish to let the _whole_ and _complete_ truth out that was sparked by
John's own version of the NuKE Info-Journal #8. If for whatever reason you
would require more information on John, by all means you may mail me via
Internet, using my PGP key. And don't forget to include your PGP key with
that. I can and will try to make some .gif files readily available on my
anonymous ftp site the moment I get everything re-adjusted. As I do have some
pictures right now of Aristotle's Home, and him in his truck driving to work,
currently these pictures are in .GIF format, but in Black & White, I will
re-scan them in colour to be available ASAP, keep in touch on internet IRC,
on #virus, mainly during the weekend evenings for the goodies.

Lets take it from the top, at the moment in time when john comes into first
contact with NuKE. It jumps back about a year ago, when something called 
VXNet existed in the United States. VXNet, was a fido-based message network
for virus programmers in america. NuKENet, at that time existed for the sole
purpose for connecting many of the foreign NuKE systems, eg; Australia, 
Sweden, Switzerland... And naturally only NuKE systems were on NuKENet, but
that change after a I got into contact with a few people. The name escapes
my databanks, on the administrator of VXNet, Falcon? (in 804) I believe it
was. Nevertheless, hooking up on Falcon's system was a time consuming
problem,so I took the feed off some poor guy's system down there, named
Aristotle. 

Boy, so I united VXNet with NuKENet, via a slow 2400 baud hook up on 
Aristotle's system. Even though the speed was slow, I _tolerated_ the 
long distance costs required to hook up the two networks together. And so 
Aristotle meets NuKE.

Time passes, and I get to know John aka Aristotle, I classified him as a 
simple 'loud-mouth' and still do today. Because if you want something to
be echoed to the n'th power, John was the man for the job. My message to 
him at that time was to spread NuKENet around, and spread it far and wide. 
That was a small error on my part, because I underestimated John's judgement
capabilities. John isn't one of _us_. And what are we? I think I can classify
_us_ in one simple and easy term, and we are "do'ers". 

It's a loose term, but stands quite strong, I find that all (real) hackers
are do'ers. No matter what the task is, we can excel in it, we do what we 
have to do, in order to succeed. School comes easy to a hacker (in general),
any 'poor' results are because of lack of interest, not lack of knowledge. 
I find the hours hackers spend on some project is unmeasurable. I remember
my first thrill on learning assembler for the 80x86, I had just bought my
first assembler book, and during the bus ride home, I had completed the 
book. 

John on the other case is a 'blabber'. I remember him boasting how ]<00L he
was because he spoke to so and so, and how Elite he was because he spoke to
NuKE members, and how dangerous he was because he knew so and so, and how ...
and how ... etc ...

So what does a bit of incompetence in John do? Let me put it this way,
anybody that crossed  his path with a modem got hooked up to NuKENet. John
blabbed his mouth to Shareware Sysops, they thought he was ]<0oL and he gave
them NuKENet, all the PD boards loved him. Sometimes 20 in the same areacode
all with NuKENet. Feeds went everywhere, AV people, newcomers that just
bought a computer and haven't figure DOS out ,yet, Cops, you name it!
Everybody that could have done no-good was hooked up to NuKENet, now. 

It was Nowhere Man that first raised the concern, on the handling of whom
John connected on his system. But what does this create? How about a 
million John followers, sound to you? But that wasn't a problem for me, what
was a problem was the way John handled the Net. I mean purposely deleted
messages and creating a one-way feed. You see the mail entered United States
via John's system, so what john planned was to get two NuKENet systems going,
the first was the _original_ networked that branched all the international
countries, and that all entered USA via john. The second was john's very own
USA only net. Mail from the first and original network never got through and
if it did very few messages did. You see John had to portray that he was the
one and only one figure in NuKE to the USA peasant followers, as he like 
to refer to as.

Now for the questions of morals. Its no secret, that NuKE had other various
fields of interest, rather than simply Viruses. We were hackers, naturally,
and as hackers we are talented in many areas of computers. MSDOS is fun, 
but that's not the only OS out there. And as EVERY Informational Journal
from NuKE, we contained some non-related virus topics. But the prior Info
Journal (#7), contained some articles that didn't go very well with john. We
had some technical articles on Cellular Phones and some Chemical Compound(s).
Apparently, this something Aristotle didn't 'agree' upon. 

For factual purposes, Aristotle was _nothing_ in ties to NuKE. I had him for
_one_ sole purpose, and that was to spread the NuKE name, good or bad, he did
_exactly_ as I expected him to do so. Aristotle was nothing more, and yes he
hub the NuKENet, for me in USA. He was never a 'NuKE' member, only a
supporter, and he never could have been a NuKE member, as he held no
'amazing' talents, besides blabbing away, like a crying woman. I'd content
him on the phone saying he was my 'best brother' and bull stories, but those
whom I've been close to, knew Aristotle was my messenger boy.

So, back to over story, Info-Journal #7 was a slap in the face to Aristotle,
as he had all his little followers thinking he was some sort of prime
director of NuKE. All the stories he fantasized to the reporters and AVers,
crumbled before him has the Info-Journal put the facts straight where NuKE
stood. Which will _never_ solely revolved on viruses only, but on freedom of
Information, and intellectual challenges. As a result, John decided to spark
a conspiracy and try for the take over of NuKE. And NuKENet was going to be 
his ticket for it.

But everything never did run as planned, this was first noticed by myself,
on a phone call by myself to John. We spoke for hours, and john reflected
that the Cellular & Chemical articles from the IJ #7, was bad, and tried to
set up all sorts of stories claiming that we created several enemies, and
such and such. In fact this was far from the truth, I knew that, but I played
to his game, and I watched as Aristotle would 'fake' messages on the net as
unknown characters claiming satanic and terrible opinions and flaming myself
about the articles that were published in the IJ #7. I handled the messages
calmly,  and surprised john, by not flaming back. But on that same phone
conversation, I told john straight, NuKE wasn't his to control, and those
articles on H/P will continue to be featured in the journals for issues to
come. At that moment he threatens myself to 'shut off, and discontinue',
basically he'd cut the NuKENet, and continue on his own with the 30 or so,
BBSes he had connected on his end of the net. Basically john threatened to
hostilely take 'NuKE' over from me, and continue on his own with the systems 
he had connect to his system. And the phone call was slammed to my face, by
john.

I understood that the hostile takeover was impossible, but because he was my
gateway to the USA. As he hub all the USA systems for me, he would succeed
in cutting me off temporarily from USA with the net. And I knew he was
possible because john had done the same thing to VXnet, as once the VXers
became depended on him. It was somewhat the same for NuKENet, but I delayed
it and called john back moments later saying, 'I was sorry.' and that 'he was
right, and that I should take up his recommendations to help NuKE.'.  

I had no intention of this personally, but I did what I had to do, in order
to turn the table around, and the power I once gave to john I removed. I did
this with the help of Firecracker, whom was a long-time and a REAL
trust-worthy friend that goes way-way back. We set up Firecracker as another
hub in the USA for NuKENet, and we began transferring those we had polling
john to poll Firecracker. I further helped out by not sending mail to john's
system, as my system would call his, for the reason, that if I wished to
discontinue I would be able do to so, and delay the fact to john, by
replying 'modem' trouble and I couldn't call his system, buying me more time.

At this moment hell began to break loose between john and Firecracker,
because just then we began to learn that Aristotle was censoring NuKENet, to
promote his 'god-like' figure in NuKE. Hell broke loose because the 'truth'
was now getting to all john's followers, loosing support for his fabricated
stories.  So he puts down his system, hoping to cripple NuKE, which in turn
doesn't happen as we hooked back up, those whom loss access to NuKENet. So
all that screaming of us telling john to 'cut' people on the Net isn't true,
it was fabricated by john in order to create a few enemies towards us, as a
matter of fact we tried our best to re-hook those that we feeding from
john's end. This did surprise john, and which resulted in him calling me,
screaming at me telling me why we requested for him to 'cut' off all the
systems from his end, when we re-hooked the very same systems on
Firecracker's system. Apparently john didn't get it, that we did it for him
to get out of the chain of command, and not for those that were on the net. 

For those of you whom might think we 'ruthlessly' kicked john out, and wish
to feel sorry for him, and turn against us, let me tell you a few facts on 
john 's doing behind everyone's back during that time. You see john's _only_
focus was to 'show' everyone his power and strength on how he could be able
to 'bust' anyone anytime anywhere. 

WORKING BEHIND NUKE

Remember the NED (NuKE Encryption Device) polymorphic engine Nowhere Man
completed? Well the 0.91 (beta) source code was distributed amongst NuKE
privately, and I did give john a copy for his eyes only as promised to me.
This was the first test on john's integrity, by myself. The source of NED
till today does is not on any of the 'so-called' virus exchange BBSes, but
john used the NED engine to bargain with, gaining support amongst AVers. He
secretly distributed the NED engine to _every_ AntiVirus maker he was in
contact to, and used the engine to try to portray an image to people that he
was the 'ruler' of NuKE. We found out about this by accident, from a new
virus programmer at that time called Little Loc (aka Priest). Little Loc came
into contact to john, and john played him his charming act on him, and for
'proof' of his power, he gave Little Loc a copy of the NED engine, whom in
turn uploaded it to a virus exchange underground system, in which the sysop
of the system came into contact with us.  And told use whom uploaded the
engine. So I and Nowhere Man immediately gave Little Loc a call, requested 
where he got the NED code, which was supposed to a private code within NuKE.
He returned us the name of Aristotle, which we next called. 

Aristotle, tried to played us smoothly, saying it was a total accident, and
that he only wished for Little Loc to have a few sources he had in his
hard-drive. And when he went to PKZip his viral source directory, NED was
accidentally inside the Zip. Upon checking this out with Little Loc, whom
gave us a different story, telling us john actually showed him NED while in
chat mode, and he captured the code that Aristotle displayed to him. Telling
us, Aristotle, no doubt gave the NED source code to Little Loc, knowing
exactly what he was doing. And that an 'accident' as john explained to us was
totally bogus. So we dug further. 

We soon find out, that john has been secretly giving the NED source code to
several people, even though he claimed to us on the same phone call about the
accident of NED being ZIPped to Little Loc, that he swore Little Loc was the
_only_ person to get NED and he was 110% sure that no other person got it.
Which of course didn't stand to our investigation, echoing back that john
voluntary gave them NED for certain favours. In result, _every_  Anti-Virus
person secretly received and distributed NED amongst themselves, by the
result of john's doing.

This was a serious blow of trust, and questioned Aristotle's trustability,
which we now rate at 0%. But again I played it smooth, with john, buying his
bogus story, and didn't let hold what I really knew about his doing(s). 

JOHN AND THE FEDS.

John again is a 'blabber' and he spoke to everyone for no absolute reason.
John being quite upset on NuKE IJ #7 (remember the H/P stuff) was warranted
on trying to get some of us out of the picture so he could have tried to
'take-over' NuKE. (Fat-chance). John would have one of his followers,
Megadeath to set up 1-800 conferences, (illegally), in order to try to get
us to call, leading to some sort of bust. For some reason or another, john
would warn FBI of these 'illegal' conferences he would set up,  yupe that's
right he'd called the FBI bureau's so that they would be able to get a trace
on all that would be on those conferences. 

His goal? To get all of _us_ to become publicly known, trying to find the
"true" identity behind my alias, and Nowhere Man, and others. To try to ruin
us, and make us criminals naturally. 

Remember the Satanbug virus? This virus created by Priest aka Little Loc, did
some _major_ infection problems in the state of california. The officials
were 'sent' to investigate and get the criminal behind the Satanbug virus.
No official knew who Priest aka Little Loc was, only a few people like P/S
members , internal NuKE and john contained the identity of this person. We
know that the P/S members can be trusted beyond doubt, and internal NuKE.
But not john! What did john do? He did place a call to the Secret Service and
traded the information of whom the creator of the Satanbug virus was! How do
I know this? Well because Priest aka Little Loc received a visit from the
Secret Service on this issue of him being the author of the Satanbug virus. 

Now it wasn't the SS intention to seek out Priest, but since john handed over
his information willingly, the SS went to visit Priest. Priest being under
legal age, wasn't charged by the SS. Nevertheless, such a visit creates a
file on you, and can begin a surveillance trend for future possible charges
being laid. What a friend? huh? May I remind you, Little Loc in no way ever
did anything against john  to deserve this. What does this tell you about
John? 

MORE FED CONTACTS

Down in the state of Virginia, where Aristotle lives, also is home to a great
person whom I've gotten to know as Wolfee J. It is no secret, that Wolfee J.
is a Law-enforcing State Cop.  But Wolfee J., is not some Hacker-Buster, he's
basically  'one of us' . No not a criminal, just a curious person. On one
instance Wolfee J., and Aristotle spoke together on the phone. This was quite
a while back, when we were blink of john's back-stabbing actions. The topic
of conversation was really nothing important, but two people talking. At one
point or another, the topic of hackers came up, and moral issues between
them. Wolfee J., explained that he had a top-secret meeting the following day
with Secret Service officials on a credit card fraud investigation. Anyhow
the topic just came out like so, and Wolfee didn't expect anything out of it.
Until the next day, when Wolfee received a call that the meeting they were
to have with a SS agent has been cancelled due to the fact that someone had
called their office claiming he knew about the 'top-secret' meeting. 

You see, Wolfee didn't breath a word about his meeting to another, but john.
As you see the odds are dropping fast, and only leads me to come up with the
following fact; that john called up the Secret Service and blew up the
meeting to them. Why? Well to raise havoc, to show his power, to us. I
personally find that john wanted to 'show-off' or either form friends down
at the SS station, and how could he prove his 'worthiness'? Well, by blowing
up a TOP-SECRET meeting nobody was to know. Perhaps this would prove to them
that john was 'worthy' of information, and be listed on some sort of payroll
that would work back and forth. 

PUTTING HIS FOOT DOWN

Naturally if john doesn't like you, he will get 'rid' of you. As he solely
likes to claim his superior power to you. And another point in time not to
long ago, a personal friend of NuKE was fired from her job because some wise
ass called her place of work and spoke to her employer and painted a horror
picture. The victim as we all know, is known to us as Typhoid Mary. She
unfortunately, was introduced to us via john. So just as Little Loc, john
contained the phone number and name and address of Typhoid Mary. But 
somewhere down the line, when we start to boot Aristotle out, he tried to
perhaps "affect" us, by shooting off blank bullets, and tried to set an
example by using Typhoid Mary.

It is a fact that john has admitted on tape that he did call the employer of
Typhoid Mary, but he denies any such story claiming her termination to the
job was due to his call. Of course that's john's side of the story, now let
me explained to you the un-biased story. 

It is believed that john did place a call to Typhoid's ex-employer, this was
a permanently job she held, so stories saying it was 'temporary' from john
are simply not true, I even have a fax of her permanent status of the
company. Naturally, I cannot foretell you what was said in the conversation,
but I can put it together, quite accurately, from the actions taken after the
call. Which resulted in a confiscations of Typhoid's computer by company
security figures. And as they were told, they found a copy of VCL, and long
distanced calls that were place to various non-related work numbers. 

According to the events and understanding john, I can put the topic of the
call, to which that john painted a horrible picture, about untrue events that
Typhoid did. Meaning, john must have said that Typhoid was involved in some
serious underground 'illegal' activities, with various members of the
underground, and involved in a scam to spread the un-usefulness of
destructive viruses created from a VCL kit. And that long distance calls
where charged to the expense of the company for her pleasure taking illegal
activities. John for sure, threatened with possible legal actions that would
down grade the public view of the company, by keeping a person of such
immoral activities part of the company. 

Naturally, beyond this point, a letter of termination is as sure as can be
to Typhoid, which did result in the loss of her job. 

ODDS BEGIN TO FALL FASTER

What are the chances of this being a total lie? Not likely, and how do I
benefit in telling you a bogus lie? I don't, I'm simply giving you
information that has been said by many _unrelated_ people that have come into
contact with john. I received a _very_ interested report from a person whom
claimed this to be 100% fact! The names of these people will be withheld for
public reasons, but for validation of truth, I did forward Aristotle the
names of the people whom claim this fact, in order to make this stand. 

Apparently, some hacker in Colorado known as BL (Black Lightening) was busted
mid 1993. He was given a chance to read the report on how his arrestation was
obtained, and the report read that two federal agents where on the case,
along with the help of a john buchanan, whom did give information on whom was
the person behind the alias "Black Lightening".

KIM GOING DOWN

Recently, I received a taped conversation between john and Firecracker, the
focus of the conversation was some sort of showing of power from john's
behalf. He claimed, that one of the first conferences we had with Kim Clancy,
that he was the reason on why she was forced to close her BBS. Apparently,
john claimed in using the same procedure of calling up the person's employer
and social engineering them to believe the fact of illegal activities, and
naturally threatened actions, (legal or press) against the company if action
was not taken. 

And to the result we had witness the result of Kim, publicly removing herself
from the 'underground' scene, and not being able to relate to hackers any
more. 

CALL IT CRAP WHEN YOU SEE IT

You know this can go on for quite a while, I have many more events that I can
provide you with. But the fact remains, that there is a problem here, and
it's Aristotle. The reason behind this article was to present to you facts
and events from john, that I've known for quite sometime. I don't _totally_
believe everything I have printed here. Meaning I don't believe john to be
some sort of 'high' law-official, that can bust you on the snap of  his
fingers. 

Most of the events described, where perhaps admitted by john, not for the
reason that he actually did it, but for the reason that he wanted to put some
sort of scare on us, and setting as an example of his power over you. 

I never found john to be in any threat to myself, he has tried to publicly
denounce my 'so-called' real information to the public, posting up my real
name, address and number. He has done the same for Firecracker, Screaming
Radish, Typhoid Mary, and Nowhere Man. Much of the information he posted was
flawed. But he tried to set an example on 'how' powerful he was. Which is a
total case of  crap. You know he came to my 'real' name by getting the
operator to reveal the information on the owner of my line. Hoping that I
had the same family name that he received, which was not accurate. 

And the fact he asked the AT&T operator, what a story, first of all the
operator will not give you a name for a telephone number. Only law-officials
can warrant that information, so how did john get it? Is he part of the law
officials? PLEASE!! He got little Jackel to ask his sister to do the job, as
she works for AT&T. 

And nevertheless john tried to portray some sort of image that he got that
info 'simply' by asking the operator! (hah). I've mentioned it before, john
obtain's no talent, but his mouth. Personally he's a female in a mans body!
Well its not totally a "mans" body, trust me I've seen the pictures! 

BEING FEARED OF FEAR

That's the method john is trying to scare you by, with fear itself. That's
the reason I why I wrote this article. I sat down, and patiently watched him
use up all his boasting and bullshit stories. Now I return my say here. My
message is simply, John is nothing. As he claims to be all mighty and
powerful, we _easily_ got his info, without the aid of outside help. 

Remember that, John is nothing! He's not a programmer, have you seen his
'so-called' viruses? All are VCL, MPC strains, not one bit of code is his'.
Like I said, john CAN'T program assembler for shit. Did you see the fake
NK-INFO8.ZIP released from john? He used the Nuke Info-Journal #4 source code
I gave him. And if you compare, john 'complained' that the code for the
journal was flawed and bad, in which he had to 'fix' it! 

Hah! Compare, his fake release of IJ #8, with #4, and you will see each menu
contains the SAME number of articles! And each article contains the EXACT
same number of lines that IJ #4 had! You know why? Well I hard coded the
information of each article for that exact reason, that you'd would need to
be a whiz in order to 'alter' the code. In which john was unsuccessful in
doing. 

Everywhere we look we see a fake! You can see that his experience in viral
code, never surpass the features of what VCL , MPC, G2, and IVP can produce.
He simply does not understand a how to progress and learn assembler to the
level we at NuKE have. 

Again, compare his words and 'fake' info-journals to ours, we provide (or try
to) provide cutting edge intellectual ideas and challenges. 

ENDING IT OFF

I 'm simply tired and all this, and john for that matter. I have no further
intention with john. As a matter of fact, I am on the process of closing
"Cybernetic Violence BBS" in 514  (NuKE WHQ) and going to internet! We have
received a 24 hour 56k connection to Internet! And during this summer we will
set up our _private_ Unix system on Internet where our 'members' can telnet
for no cost and we can once again return to the older days when we worked on
constructive brainstorming ideas. 

And the best part of  this is that john can obtain no access to.  We will
have one system on Internet that everyone in the world can call without
having to pay long distance charges! All you need is internet access and we
will provide you an account with our system. All accounts will be to personal
supporter and member we at NuKE have today, so that you can stay in tune and
await some amazing future Info-Journals from us to come.

Without the dumb 'school-yard' fight featured with Aristotle. All NuKErs will
be part of this Internet system, and access will be gained from being part
of the current Public BBS system we have available.  But the 'real' fun will
certainly only happen in the Internet system.

Unfortunately, due to limited time on my part, I will only be part of the
Internet system, and not the public BBSes, available. All NuKE members will
go to the trend of being part of this new private Internet system, so that
we can be more productive, and maintain order. 

Expect the new system on Internet within the summer. The Internet Unix system
will be hosted by a powerful Pentium 66Mhz, with 32Megs of RAM and a Gigabyte
Hard-Disk drive, running Linux. This new system will be hosted by the company
