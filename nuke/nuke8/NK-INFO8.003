TH205                    144 - 165 TX/RX MOD

To open your TH-205,215,or 225 all you have to do is take out the screws
on the back, and gently open up the front of the unit...locate the obvious
4 jumper bridges on the PC board.  The bridges are numbered J-1, J-2, J-3,
and J-4..jumper J-3 has already been cut...carefully snip jumpers J-1 and
J-2 and ever so slightyl seperate the snipped bridges to insure no-contact
between the points. Reassemble the unit..Look at your instruction manual
and reset the microprocessor..The MOD will not work until you reset the MPU...
the info. for reset is near the back of the manual..after that the unit is
wide open to operate between 144 to 165...Good Luck ..

	    KENWOOD TH-series HT TNC Interconnection

The  following is a suggested circuit for connecting a packet TNC
to a Kenwood TH-series HT.  Included is the TH-21/31/41,  the TH-
205/215/315/415, and the new TH-25/45 series HTs.

The connections are as follows:

     A  sub-miniature plug is used for receive audio.  The tip of
     this  plug  is audio out;  the sleeve of this  plug  is  the
     common ground for PTT, transmit audio, and receive audio.

     A  miniature stereo plug is used for transmit audio and PTT.
     Connect  the middle "ring" of the plug to the TNC audio  out
     through a 0.2 uf cap (for DC isolation).  Connect the sleeve
     of the plug to the TNC PTT. The plug's tip is unused.

Set  the  TNC audio for 50 to 80 mv audio output into  a  2K  ohm
impedance.

TH215A.1

Subject: KENWOOD TH-215A TO TNC

The hook-up of a TH-215A to my PAC-COMM tiny 2 TNC was very easy.
There are no components involved in the connection. All you need are
two phone plugs: 1 sub mini, and 1 stereo(3 conductor) mini.
Both available from Radio Shack,two to a pack.
If you have a Kenwood speaker mike, then the instruction sheet will
contain a drawing showing the basic connection lines. If not, here's
how its done:
The sub-mini is the speaker plug. The centre pin goes to the speaker pin
on the 5 pin din on the TNC, the shaft is the ground.
On the mini stereo plug, you dont use the centre pin. just the two
shaft connections. The short shaft goes to mike, the long shaft is the
push to talk......Thats it, foor wires to the connector that goes to
the TNC plug, and youre in business.

One very very important thing-----always make sure that all battery
save functions on the handy talkie are off. If it isnt, a slight delay
in receiving will cause retrys from the station sending to you, and
will delay packet reception at your end. Please make careful note of this.

=============================================================================

This is the RX modification for the TH25e.
Remove resister R28 and place resister R18 on the unit
X53-3080-xx.
Your RX range shows now the frequencies 136-165 Mhz.
The PLL lockrange is 138-164 Mhz.

TH25AT

The Mars & Cap mod for the Kenwood TH-25AT is to remove resistors R18-21.
They are located on a panel under the display.  This one is a real pain
to access but this mod gives transmit coverage from 140-163 Mhz.  The
TM-721A mod gives transmit from 142-152 Mhz.
TH25AT.1

The following information is for the modification of the Kenwood
TH-25AT 2 meter handheld. Thanks go to Brad Killebrew, N5LJV for
providing this modification. I have not tried this modification
so I can't verify that this will work.
 
TH-25AT MARS/CAP MODIFICATION
 
The following modification will allow the TH-25AT to transmit
from 141.000 Mhz to 162.995 Mhz. Specifications are guaranteed
for the Amateur band only. The transceiver may require
realignment of the PLL circuits.
 
1. Disconnect the battery pack and antenna.
 
2. Remove the VOLUME, SQUELCH, and TUNING control knobs by
   pulling them straight up from the top panel.
 
3. Using a 7mm spanner wrench, remove the nut from the VOLUME
   control and the nut from the TUNING control.
 
4. Remove one screw located by the PTT switch.
 
5. Remove one screw located by the speaker jack.
 
6. Remove two screws from the battery terminal plate.


The schematic for the TH-25AT shows:

TH-45E    W         -61     X      O    X    O      O     O    O

where O means USED, and X means NOT USED.

R18 in
R28 in
This is how the radio is delivered in the USA.  The radio covers
438-450 MHz.

R18 in
R20 out
The radio is prohibited from tuning outside 440-450 MHz.

R18 out
R28 in
The radio will only tune from 215-230 MHz.  Note that the PLL would not
lock up!  (What did you expect?)  Could it be possible that Kenwood
originally planned a 220 version of this radio, but then scrapped their
plans?

R18 out
R28 out
The radio will tune from 200-500 MHz (on the display only - your PLL
will not lock up over this entire range).  Transmitting is possible
anywhere your PLL will lock up.

I have found a quick and easy way to retune your PLL (in the TH45-AT)
with a minimum of test equipment.  All you need is a scope and a small
tuning tool.  First, take off the battery pack holder plate.  Then,
remove the silvery sticker covering the tuning pot access holes.  
CONTINUED IN FILE TH25AT.7
TH25AT.12
  Tune the radio about 1 MHz higher so that
the PLL locks up again, and note the voltage on the testpoint, TP1.
Now, tune the radio to the LOWEST frequency that you want to be able to
receive.  Adjust TC1 until the voltage on the test point TP1 is the same
as what was noted earlier.  Button the radio back up, and you're
done.  You will not be able to tune the PLL to any range you want.
There are limits.  On my radio, I have been able to retune the radio so
that I can recieve from 439.2-468.6 MHz with a set of batteries fresh
out of the charger.  The tuning range will probably diminish as the
battery voltage decreases.  I have not retuned the PLL on my 2m HT, but
I'd imagine the same technique will prove fruitful.

I may have some more information on these radios someplace.  If I can
find it, I will add to this posting, and post it again with the updated

TH25AT.4

Subject: KENWOOD TH-25/45 OUT OF BAND MODIFICATIONS

Here are some mods for the TH-25AT and the TH-45AT.  Please
note that I do not encourage transmitting on a frequency for which you
do not have a license, nor do I encourage transmitting on a non-amateur
frequency without FCC type accepted equipment (in the United States).

First let me recommend that you buy the service manuals for these
radios.  The service manual is not expensive (about $15 I think) and it
will greatly help you in performing these modifications.

Look at the schematic for your radio.  In the lower left hand corner is
an IC labled IC2.  This is an ASIC microprocessor.  At the lower right
hand corner of this uP are several diodes and pull-up/pull-down
resistors.  They are D4, D3, R19, R18, R28, R20, R21, R22, R25, R26, and
a couple of resistors that are not even on the schematic that attach to
B2 (pin 51 on IC2) and B3 (pin 50 on IC2).  The TH-45AT schematic shows
R23 on the ASIC uP pin B2.
CONTINUED IN FILE TH25AT.10
 TH25AT.5
Some of the above codes are:
K     USA
T     England
X     Australia
M     Other Areas

These components are found on the flexible circuit board under the
display.  To get to them, take the radio apart.  Some unsoldering of
obvious grounding wires may be necessary.  You will see where the
flexible circuit board plugs into a socket on the main circuit board.
Before unplugging it, make sure you know what's in the memories, because
they will be lost.  Unplug the flexible circuit board and unfold it so
that the components are accesable.  One of the fold-out parts of the
flexible board will look something like this:


+----------------+
! R   R R D3 R R !
! 2   2 2    7 2 !
! 5   3 2      1 !
!                !
! R  O      O R20!            The O's are solder pads.
! 2  O      O R19!
! 6  O      O R18!
!    O      O R28!
!                !
!              R !
!           D4 6 !
!        +-------+
!        !
!        !

The fold out board is actually square, but with only characters for
graphics, I couldn't draw it that way.
On both radios, R36 is for the European tone burst to "whistle up"
repeaters.
On both radios, D4 is for selecting the type of display.  With D4 in,
the display is normal.  With D4 removed, the display is a channel
display.
D3 is for selecting VHF or UHF.  With D4 in, the radio thinks its a VHF
radio.  With D4 removed, the radio thinks its a UHF radio.  Don't change
this on your radio.

============================================================================

On the TH-25AT:
(All frequencies given in MHz.)

R22 in
R28 out
This is how the radio is delivered in the USA.  TX 144-1, 141-163
(I think).

R22 out
R28 in
The radio tunes from 142-151.  This may be the modification given
to US MARS members.  I don't remember where the unit will transmit.  It
may or may not transmit outside the range from 144-148.

R22 in
R28 in
The radio tunes only from 144-148.

R22 out
R28 out
Frequencies may be selected from 100-200 MHz (on the display only - your
PLL will not lock up in this entire range).  In addition, TX is possible
where your PLL locks up.

R25 out
Removing R25 disables automatic offset selection.

R23 and R24 are used for selecting the step size for tuning.  I can't
remember which positions are for which step sizes, and alas I didn't
write down what I found.  If you want to play with this, go ahead.
CONTINUED IN FILE TH25AT.11
TH25AT.7

If the
radio is positioned on its back, with the top folded over so that the
touch tone pad is also facing down, the test point you want (TP1) is on
the bottom half of the radio, near the center (left to right), and close
to the battery; the tuning pot you want (TC1) is on the bottom, and
closest to the PTT switch.  Under no circumstances change the tuning of
TC51.  This is used to calibrate the output of the radio with the
display the radio is giving; you don't want to mess with it.  Once
again, the Service Manual makes it very clear where these points are, if
you are having trouble with my descriptions.  On with retuning the PLL.
With the radio on, and receiving, monitor the voltage and the waveform
on test point TC1.  Tune the radio DOWNWARDS in frequency until the PLL
unlocks.  Note that the radio will beep when this happens, and the
waveform on TP1 will change.

TH25AT.8 
7. Carefully pull the front panel up from the transceiver (do 
   not break the wires connected between the front panel and the
   body of the transceiver). Lay the front panel to the side of
   the transceiver (keep track of the PTT and F.LOCK covers if
   they come off).
 
8. Gently lift the top panel from the transceiver by pulling it
   forward and then up (the "O" ring on the BNC connector will
   produce some tension).
 
9. Rotate the top panel toward the front of the radio to expose
   the 3/4 x 3/4 inch board.
 
10. Using a 45 watt (or less) soldering iron that has an isolated
    or grounded tip, unsolder and remove chip resistors R19 - 21
    from the Control Unit (X53-3080-02).
 
11. Carefully assemble the transceiver by reversing steps 1-9.
    Pull the BNC connector "O" ring up a little before installing
    the top panel.
 
12. Reset the microprocessor by the following the preocedure in
    the instruction manual (page 16) called  CLEARING ALL MEMORY.

TH26AT

EXTENDED TX COVERAGE ON THE KENWOOD: TH-26AT/TH-45AT/TH-75A HT's
================================================================
 
On the three above units a jumper wire controls the TX frequency coverage. By
removing the jumper you will extend TX from 142-152Mhz. By removing a diode
you can extend the TX coverage to the limits of the VCO. Both the jumper wire
and the diode are located on the "CONTROL UNIT". On the TH-26AT this is just
a bare jumper wire, TH-45AT ???, TH75A it is a green wire labled W1. Removing
or lifting D4 on the TH-75A extends TX from 136-174Mhz and 335-512Mhz. On the
TH-26/TH-46 models this would be 136-174Mhz and 335-512Mhz respectivly.

TH-28e/48e TX EXPANSION
 Remove the diode D10 from the control unit.
 New TX ranges after this modification:
 TH28e:
 VHF Band  136.000 - 174.250 Mhz (FM)
 TH48e:
 UHF Band  400.000 - 470.000 Mhz (FM)

 Note: Manufacturer guarantees TX/RX specification only in amateur
       band. The above frequency range is for the microprocessor's
       range so that the receiver sensitivity or TX output power
       of expanded band may be reduced.

TH-48E TX/RX 432-438 Mhz LIMITED RANGE
 Remove the diode D14 from the control unit.

TH28e/48e CROSS BAND REPEATER
 Remove the diode D4 then press F key for 1 sec. and press 0 key.

TH-28a/e-48a/e FREQUENCY EXTENSION
 Open the case and remove or add the destination chip diode D10,
 D11, D14 and D15 on the component side of the control unit.
 (X53-340X-XX, X53-341X-XX)
 The frequncy can then be extended as shown in the table 1 an 2
 on page 3 and 4.(See the destination chip diode position drawing on
 the attached sheet.)
 Notes: The frequency display range may differ from the PLL lock
	range.

CLONING BY RADIO
 1) Overview of the clone function. (The function does not require
    frequency expansion.)
    Since 240 channels are available if an option is installed, it
    is laborious to write the same memory channel frequency data
    into several transceivers. Once you write data into one
    transceiver, you can duplicate it in several others in a single
    operation with the clone function. (You can write data without
    installing an option.)
 2) How to use the clone function.
    Transmitter setup:
    1 Write the required memory channel frequency data into the
      transceiver.
    2 Set the transmit frequency.
    3 Switch the power off, hold down the 7 key on an F series
      tranceiver or the MR and PTT keys on a K series, and switch
      the power on again.
    "CLONE" appears on the display.
    (The transmit output is automatically set to "economic low".)

    Receiver setup:
    1 Set the frequency of the transceiver to the transmit frequency
      of the transmitter.
    2 Switch the power off, hold down the 7 key on an F series
      transceiver or the MR and PTT keys on a K series one, and
      switch the power on again.
    "CLONE" appears on the display.
    Press the PTT key on the transmitter. The clone function works
    automatically. When cloning ends, the frequency is displayed
    again.
    It takes about four minutes to transfer frequency data for 40
    channels, and about nine minutes to transfer frequency data for
    240 channels.
    If the receiver is an F series one and the frequency is displayed
    again, switch the power off, hold down the F key, and switch the
    power on again (VFO reset). If the receiver is a K series one and
    the frequency is displayed again, switch the power off and on
    again.
    Thus, cloning lets you copy the channel data stored in the 
    transmitter to other transceivers in a single operation. To stop
    cloning, switch the power off and on again.

Subject: KENWOOD TH-25/45 OUT OF BANAD MODIFICATIONS

Here are some mods for the TH-25AT and the TH-45AT.  Please
note that I do not encourage transmitting on a frequency for which you
do not have a license, nor do I encourage transmitting on a non-amateur
frequency without FCC type accepted equipment (in the United States).

First let me recommend that you buy the service manuals for these
radios.  The service manual is not expensive (about $15 I think) and it
will greatly help you in performing these modifications.

Look at the schematic for your radio.  In the lower left hand corner is
an IC labled IC2.  This is an ASIC microprocessor.  At the lower right
hand corner of this uP are several diodes and pull-up/pull-down
resistors.  They are D4, D3, R19, R18, R28, R20, R21, R22, R25, R26, and
a couple of resistors that are not even on the schematic that attach to
B2 (pin 51 on IC2) and B3 (pin 50 on IC2).  The TH-45AT schematic shows
R23 on the ASIC uP pin B2.

On the TH-25AT:
(All frequencies given in MHz.)

R22 in
R28 out
This is how the radio is delivered in the USA.  TX 144-1, 141-163
(I think).

R22 out
R28 in
The radio tunes from 142-151.  This may be the modification given
to US MARS members.  I don't remember where the unit will transmit.  It
may or may not transmit outside the range from 144-148.

R22 in
R28 in
The radio tunes only from 144-148.

R22 out
R28 out
Frequencies may be selected from 100-200 MHz (on the display only - your
PLL will not lock up in this entire range).  In addition, TX is possible
where your PLL locks up.

R25 out
Removing R25 disables automatic offset selection.

R23 and R24 are used for selecting the step size for tuning.  I can't
remember which positions are for which step sizes, and alas I didn't
write down what I found.  If you want to play with this, go ahead.

On the TH-45AT:
(All frequencies are given in MHz.)

R18 in
R28 in
This is how the radio is delivered in the USA.  The radio covers
438-450 MHz.

R18 in
R20 out
The radio is prohibited from tuning outside 440-450 MHz.

R18 out
R28 in
The radio will only tune from 215-230 MHz.  Note that the PLL would not
lock up!  (What did you expect?)  Could it be possible that Kenwood
originally planned a 220 version of this radio, but then scrapped their
plans?

R18 out
R28 out
The radio will tune from 200-500 MHz (on the display only - your PLL
will not lock up over this entire range).  Transmitting is possible
anywhere your PLL will lock up.

TH45AT.2
I have found a quick and easy way to retune your PLL (in the TH45-AT)
with a minimum of test equipment.  All you need is a scope and a small
tuning tool.  First, take off the battery pack holder plate.  Then,
remove the silvery sticker covering the tuning pot access holes.  If the
radio is positioned on its back, with the top folded over so that the
touch tone pad is also facing down, the test point you want (TP1) is on
the bottom half of the radio, near the center (left to right), and close
to the battery; the tuning pot you want (TC1) is on the bottom, and
closest to the PTT switch.  Under no circumstances change the tuning of
TC51.  This is used to calibrate the output of the radio with the
display the radio is giving; you don't want to mess with it.  Once
again, the Service Manual makes it very clear where these points are, if
you are having trouble with my descriptions.  On with retuning the PLL.
With the radio on, and receiving, monitor the voltage and the waveform
on test point TC1.

Some of the above codes are:
K     USA
T     England
X     Australia
M     Other Areas

These components are found on the flexible circuit board under the
display.  To get to them, take the radio apart.  Some unsoldering of
obvious grounding wires may be necessary.  You will see where the
flexible circuit board plugs into a socket on the main circuit board.
Before unplugging it, make sure you know what's in the memories, because
they will be lost.  Unplug the flexible circuit board and unfold it so
that the components are accesable.  One of the fold-out parts of the
flexible board will look something like this:


+----------------+

!        !

The fold out board is actually square, but with only characters for
graphics, I couldn't draw it that way.
On both radios, R36 is for the European tone burst to "whistle up"
repeaters.
On both radios, D4 is for selecting the type of display.  With D4 in,
the display is normal.  With D4 removed, the display is a channel
display.
D3 is for selecting VHF or UHF.  With D4 in, the radio thinks its a VHF
radio.  With D4 removed, the radio thinks its a UHF radio.  Don't change
this on your radio.

TH45AT.5
 Tune the radio DOWNWARDS in frequency until the PLL
unlocks.  Note that the radio will beep when this happens, and the
waveform on TP1 will change.  Tune the radio about 1 MHz higher so that
the PLL locks up again, and note the voltage on the testpoint, TP1.
Now, tune the radio to the LOWEST frequency that you want to be able to
receive.  Adjust TC1 until the voltage on the test point TP1 is the same
as what was noted earlier.  Button the radio back up, and you're
done.  You will not be able to tune the PLL to any range you want.
There are limits.  On my radio, I have been able to retune the radio so
that I can recieve from 439.2-468.6 MHz with a set of batteries fresh
out of the charger.  The tuning range will probably diminish as the
battery voltage decreases.  I have not retuned the PLL on my 2m HT, but
I'd imagine the same technique will prove fruitful.

I may have some more information on these radios someplace.  If I can
find it, I will add to this posting, and post it again with the updated
information.

=============================================================================

This is the RX modification for the TH47e.
Cut the jumper wire W301 for wide band operation.
Your RX range shows now the frequencies 400-470 Mhz.

==============================================================================

This is the RX modification for the TH75e.
Remove the green jumper on the unit X53-3200-xx on the left
side of the cpu.
Your RX display shows now the frequencies 136-174 Mhz and
335-512 Mhz.
The PLL lockrange is 142-152 Mhz and 420-450 Mhz.


==============================================================================


I have a couple of mods that you may or may not have.  For the TH-75A MARS/CAP
mod, removing D4 will allow TX across entire tuning range, except that
actual TX range will be limited by tuning of the PLL.

For the TM-731A, there is a "Beyond MARS/CAP transmit Modification".  It
provides TX from 136 to 174 and 400 to 500 MHz.  Again, actual TX range limited
by PLL tuning.  If you don't already have this and would like it, I'll
send a copy if you furnish me your address.  It involves cutting R25 on the
control unit, and installing a jumper (diagram required to locate position),
then two resets in a row.

I have tested these mods on my own rigs.

=============================================================================

		     TH75-A  MARS/CAP MODIFICATIONS



This modification will allow the TH-75A to transmit from 142 to 152 MHz and
420 to 450 MHz.   Specifications are guaranteed for the Amateur bands only.
Though the transceiver will display 136 to 174 MHz and 335 to 512 MHz, the
PLL circuit may not lock through the entire range.

MODIFICATION PROCEDURE  :

1.  Disconnect the battery and antenna.

2.  Remove the three case screws and two battery plate screws.

3.  Lift the front panel from the body of the transceiver, but do not
    disconnect the two flex cables.

4.  Cut the green jumper wire (W1) that is located to the left side of the
    CPU  in the front panel assembly.

5.  Assemble the transceiver by reversing steps 1 - 3.

6.  Reset the CPU by holding the M key as the power is turned on.

=============================================================================


This is the RX modification for the TH77e.
Cut the jumper wire W5 for wide band operation.
Your RX range shows now the frequencies 136-174 Mhz and
335-512 Mhz.
If you want wide band RX only, remove both resister R127 and
jumper wire W5 for wide band RX (136-174 / 335-512 Mhz) and 
normal TX (144-146 / 430-440 Mhz) on your HT.

TH77.1

Kenwood TH-77 Extended frequency coverage and dual-band repeater

Kenwood has made this radio compatible with the new ICOM S-Series radios
from what I can tell.  It has DTSS (Dual Tone Squelch System) which means
that your radio will not break squelch until it hears a particular
sequence of three DTMF tones (ICOM has this also and they call it
Coded Squelch which also use three tones).  The TH77A also has a paging
function that works *exactly* like the ICOM paging.  You program the
radio with a personal 3 digit DTMF code and someone pages you by
transmitting YOUR 3 digit code, followed by a * character and then
their own 3 digit code.  The ICOM will start to ring to let you know
that you have been paged and display the 3 digit code of the person
that has paged you.  The TH77A will beep once and open squelch as
long as the person that paged you does not drop carrier (I prefer
the ICOM method for this part, but there is a work around that I
will mention in a bit).  One thing the TH77A does at this point is
bring up a timer so you know how long its been since you've been
paged.  Maximum time is 99 hours and 99 minutes. 

continued in th77.2
th77.2
Let's  see if your
battery can hold out that long!  The workaround so the TH77A will
ring, rather than just beep and open squelch is to put the radio
in the pager mode AND also put it in Tone Alert.  When you get
paged... the radio will "beep beep (pause) beep beep" five times
and start up the timer.  Kenwood has provided two different types
of BEEPS for you.  The second type is to ring like an electronic
telephone.  This one *REALLY* sounds nice!!  For those of you that
like autodial memories, there are 10 memories that can store 15
characters each.  There are 40 regular frequency memories in this
radio and you can make them all UHF if you like (no restriction).
NOW!  On to the *EXTRA* capabilities (there are other BASIC functions
that I didn't mention, those were just the highlights).
After making a few modifications to this radio, you can get it to
do the regular stuff that the IC24AT will do, such as AM aircraft,
expanded UHF (400-512 depending on PLL lock) and 800-950 (again,
depending on PLL lock) in addition to cross band repeat.
HOW DO YOU DO THIS!?

    Layout shown with electrolytic capacitor C124 removed
The best way to do this is to heat up both sides of the resistor and
push it out of the way with something small.  At least this was the
best way for me!  Once it's out, put the capacitor back in place and
close it up.  (Put the green wire back also, if you are making the
out of band TX mod too!)

 Note 1: The cross-band repeater does not turn on during dual watch.
 Note 2: If you enable the cross-band repeater when the bell function
	 is on, the bell function is turned off and the cross-band
	 repeater function is turned on. You can turn the repeater on
	 only if the bell function for the operation band is off.
 Note 3: A dedicated jumper is used to select whether to use the
	 cross-band repeater.
 Note 4: The timeout timer is set to three minutes.

Answerback function
 If the transmitter pages a receiver, it does not know whether the
 receiver has received the paging signal. When the answerback function
 is ON, the receiver returns a code automatically if the paging code
 matches to indicate that it has received the paging signal. The
 transmitter can thus confirm that the code it sent was actually
 received.

Operation
 If the paging code matches and the busy signal goes low, the receiver
 returns a code. If the paging code does not match, the receiver does
 not return a code. The answerback function is related to the bell
 function: if you turn the bell function on when the answerback
 function is on, the answerback function works; If you turn the bell
 function off, the answerback function does not work. If the answer-
 back function is off, only the bell function can be turned on or off.
 To turn the answerback function on and off, hold down the  _____ key
 and switch the POWER ON.                                  I Mhz I
