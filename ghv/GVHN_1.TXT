Section One - First Edition

        This is the inaugural issue of the Virus Heaven Newsletter.  In the
future (Starting W/ Issue #2) this will be available on this WWW Site as well
as VIA FTP at ftp.defiant.ilf.net and will be sent out VIA email to those who
email me back and request to be put on the mailing list. To subscribe - do
the following:

Send e-mail to godarky@ilf.net.  In the title of that letter put:
SUBSCRIBE: Virus Heaven Newsletter

*NOTE*
This will only be sent out to the e-mail addresses which I recieve the above
emails from.  So make sure your REAL e-mail address is what shows up in the
letter, or you wont get it, as I don't have time to fuck around hunting down
people's real e-mail addresses.

                ==============================================

Section Two - The Virus Heaven Newsletter Mission

        This newsletter has little purpose other than to keep you all aware
of what is going on, and to give you someplace else to turn as the presense
of Vx magazines continues to dwindle.

        It is no mystery that Mainstream magazines and sites have been
dropping like flies.  From what one can tell, the only reason for the
disappearances are lack of interest in continuing on.  I may get that way
one day soon too, but for now I am going strong, and will continue to
keep others up-to-date as long as I feel I am not talking to myself.  I have
yet to hear of any confirmed cases that anyone has been busted recently.

        As many of you know, my site was one of a few key distribution points
for Virus Bits & Bytes Magazine.  It has been about 2 months since I have
been able to contact Dark Night, so I don't know if another issue will be
coming out anytime soon. His site is still available via FTP (see the list in
section 4) and via WWW.  The VBB message board is broken.  I have spoken with
Chaos of ILF and he advised he might take a whack at fixing it whenever. He
has not heard from Dark Night either.

        The mission of this Newsletter is simmilair to that of Virus Bits &
Bytes magazine, but won't include executables.  It has been said by many of
the AV folks that distribution of viruses is unethical. If you wanna test out
just how strongly they believe this, try posting a uuencoded virus to
alt.comp.virus, and see how quickly your ISP (Internet Service Provider) is
made aware of your activities.  If your ISP is nice, they will either warn
you, or they will ignore the complaints.  If they share the same view, you
could be hunting for a new ISP soon.  So in all reality, I don't recommend
doing this unless you know your ISP's rules well, and you know they wont
mind. There is a newsgroup where you can get away with posting viruses, and
that would be alt.comp.virus.source.code...  Just last week the much wanted
HARE virus aka HDeuthanasia was posted there, as well as some others.  The
traffic of Virus postings there is pretty low, in fact, out of 100 messages,
70-80 of those will probably multi-level marketing scams or other various
forms of spams.

        So really, this is just another medium for you to recieve info on
what is going on in the Vx world, and maybe learn something if I decide to
type something worth reading.  Enjoy the issue, and I welcome your feedback.
You can contact me at godarky@ilf.net.

                ==============================================

Section Three - The Disappearance Of Virus Related E-magazines

        As many of you old-timers may have noticed, Virus Related magazines
just don't seem to last like they used to.  A couple of the older, possibly
legendary ones have disappeared, and even some of the newer ones have lived
a very short life.  Luckily enough they have a shelf life which exceeds that
of any of Hostess' products and are still readily available for your reading
pleasure if you don't mind hunting around.  If you do mind hunting around,
just check out the Vx Site list at the bottom, and you are sure to find what
you are looking for there, if not, let me know where you find it and what it
is, so I can check the site out.

        Yes, months ago the 40hex as well as the VLAD Homepages disappeared.
It was kind of a sad thing to see go, but we all know that new talent will
squirm it's way out of the woodwork eventually, and we will have something
else to read about, new tricks to learn and so on.

        And also within' the last month or so, the newer mag Virus Bits &
Bytes magazine seemed to have screeched to a halt as well.  With Dark Night
nowhere to be seen or heard from, and a WWW message board that is in ruins,
what remains is an in-tact VBB Headquarters/Homepage on the Information
Liberation Front server.  The VBB site seems to be working basically on
Autopilot, and no new issue looks to be in the works at this time, however
there is whispering going on that some of the other defuct members have
been busy working on a Macro Virus construction kit.

        Other individual sites have also disappeared as well.  Rhy's has
dropped out of the Alliance as President (or Chairman or whatever...) in
addition to dropping his site at ILF.  It is sad to see it go, as it was
around for quite some time.  I think his leaving is comparable to Materva
shutting down his hacking site.  And of course we cannot forget the
ChibaCity site as well.  Although I did hear rumors that it is coming back
in a different location.

        I am sorry to see all of these go, but with thier absence, there will
be some new kids to move into our block and hold loud parties, throw beer
cans in your lawn, harrass your wife, beat up your son, and probably even
date your daughter... But foremostly, there will be some new zines to arise,
and of course, there will be new viruses as well.  It is estimated that there
is still upwards of 200-300 new quality viruses a month being made, so
there are still some people writing em out there.

                ==============================================

Section Four - The Vx FTP/WWW Site Guide

        The concept of this section was created by PhreeX (phreex@ao.net).
He compiled most of this information, and has authorized it's use here. It is
A basic run-down of some of the better, more complete sites, and covers some
other various tid-bits of information as well.

        It isn't complete by any means, but at this time, life's necessities
don't permit me the time to fully update it, so what you see here, is
PhreeX's original file minus a few corrections or mini-updates.  There wasn't
time to visit every Vx site on the map, and Fly-By-Night sites will not
appear in this section at this time, since they would probably not be there
by the time you got this.  Enjoy it

Disclaimer:
I (Dr. PhreeX Merian) Can -NOT- nor will I be held responsible for your 
stupidity, viruses can destroy your/others computers (that is, the data 
within them,) if you execute a virus you just might get fucked. Collect 'em, 
study 'em, trade 'em but for god sake do **NOT** execute them.

Note: As of 10/13/96 at 19:38:03 PM EST every one of these links was valid, 
however they may die, if so please take it up with the site owner, not me!

A word on safe virus storage:
As your collection of viruses (virii) grows so does the risk of 
self-infection, believe it or not you -CAN- safely store viruses on your hard 
drive, I have over 3,000 and have NEVER been infected! Here are just a few 
things you can do to protect yourself.

1) ALWAYS keep viruses zipped up, I can not stress this enough, keep each 
virus in its own .zip with a text describing it (if possible) you can get a 
free copy of Pkzip from;
http://www.pkware.com
remember, if its zipped up it can **NOT** be executed!!!

2) Its a good idea to re-name the file extension to something other than .com 
or .exe, I use .co_ or .ex_, this way you can NOT accidentily execute the 
virus.

3) Put all your viruses in 1 (one) directory, I use c:\VIRUS, you can use 
whatever the hell you want. 

4) Get a -GOOD- AV scanner! Because everyone thinks theres is the best you 
can get reviews and sites at;
http://www.virusbtn.com
I think FProt is the best, you can download a shareware copy (gag) but thats 
no fun, I suggest you check the alt.binaries.warez.* groups for a -REAL- copy 
(its always posted somewhere). 

5) Once you get a AV scanner USE IT!!!, remember, you put all your viruses in 
one directory, most all virus scanners allow you to exclude 
drives/directories/files when you scan, set your scanner to exclude whatever 
directory your viruses are in. If you start to get reports of viruses outside 
of that directory you might have a problem.

6) If you really paranoid you can keep all your viruses on floppy disk, 
actually, this is a good idea, due to the small size of viruses you can store 
TONS of 'em on only a few disk's. ZIP drives are also nice to have, so are 
CDR's. If you put your viruses on disk LABEL the disk so others don't infect 
you.

7) USE COMMON SENSE! This is really the best protection, don't be an idiot, 
don't run anything that you don't know what it does, yadda yadda yadda...
 
On with the show......
Here is how this file is aranged;

File/Site name
http://www.this.is.the.site 
Review of the site/file will go here...

Lets get started!!

Please note the following;
I would like to keep this file somewhat small, for that reason I will not go 
into just what each virus/program does, if you wish to know just what one of 
these does the go here:
http://www.Europe.DataFellows.com/vir-info/
I also have omited links directly to virus sims (emulators), theses are used 
for testing AV scanners and are of little use to the VX community.

(God@rky: Actually according to many of the AV folks, virus sims are
useless. And that only a good test can be performed by an AV expert. As well
as the factoid that the only test they consider a good install test, is the
EICAR test.)

Part 1
[ Virus Generators ]
These are alright, however most of them do not work 100% of the time and the 
viruses are easily picked up even the most half assed scanners.

Part 5
[ Virus related FAQ's/Tutorials ]
These are FAQ's all about viruses, both removal and infection. ALso included 
are some tutorials on making viruses.

x86 Assembly Language FAQ - a86 & d86
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/assembly-language/x86/a86/
faq.html
Well, its not going to make you an assembly programer but its a good start

alt.comp.virus FAQ (This is the FULL current version, very AV)
http://www.ilf.net/god@rky/acv_faq.html
This is the FULL version of the a.c.v FAQ, not the origonal yet its still 
very good!

alt.virus FAQ (The origonal a.c.v FAQ, very VX)
http://www.ilf.net/god@rky/acvx_faq.html
This is the *ORIGONAL* a.c.v FAQ, as you can see a.c.v was made as a 
pro-virus newsgroup!

VSUMx606
ftp://ftp.germany.eu.net/pub/comp/msdos/mirror.garbo/virus/vsumx606.zip
This is an OK Hypertext.  It is said to have lots of errors in it.  You know
stuff like dates when a virus first appeared and what not, and in some cases
what the virus does.  The AV people regard it as not a very good Hypertext.
It will get the job done in many cases but it is always light years behind
what you will find at any of the Vx sites.

VDAT170
<Working on making it available at Virii Heaven Contact;
cicatrix@cyberstation.com on sites that carry it>
This is a very good up&coming hypertext.  I am impressed with how far it
has come in such little time, and think it has the potential to come along
much further. Keep an eye on this little gem in the months to come, it could
become a valuable asset to those wondering what items in thier collection or
infecting thier system are doing.

Part 8
[ Conclusion (By Dr. PhreeX Merin himself!!) ]
Well, after a few hours of surfing around andtesting ALL THESE links I give 
you the "Computer Virus Site List 1.02", this is still a beta, it will be 
until I can no longer come accross a new virus page, if you know of anything 
VX related please e-mail me (phreex@ao.net).

You might object to this list, many people do, they believe viruses should be 
illegal and no one should access to them however if you dislike this then 
fine, don't read it or download from the above sites. The problem is lamer 
newbie fucks think the internet is like the real world, where there is a 
organized legal system to stop anyone that does wrong, well .. welcome to 
cyberspace, people like me will always be here!!

Part 9
[ Past version history, and whats to come ]

Version 1.0 Beta 1
Listed a few sites, lots of Virus Gens.

Version 1.01
Added more URL's, added section on safe virus storage.

Version 1.02
Current.

For a current copy of this list send a request to phreex@ao.net or looking in 
the usenet newsgroup alt.comp.virus

Section Five - Uncanny Virus Ideas

        Well at this point, I guess this section would otherwise be empty
being this is the first issue.  But we cannot have that, so I will improvise
and do my best to get us started.  This area will mostly consist of Ideas
for the Authors with virus writer's block.  Or maybe somewhat of a humor
section as well.  We will see how it goes...  If you have ideas you would
like to contribute, feel free to e-mail me at godarky@ilf.net and I will
put the best of em in the next issue. :)

1. The Eicar Virus. For those of you who don't know what the EICAR file is,
I will explain.  It is a file which you can append to just about any kind of
file and will cause the file to be reported as infected when scanned with
an AV product that supports the EICAR test file.  It is a big political
pissing contest for a standardized Installation test for AV products really.
Anyhow, an interesting Idea for a virus might be one that incorporates the
EICAR test file as camoflage.  Sounds stupid?  Think about it.  Most of the
popular AV products (F-Protect, McAfee's, Norton's (I think) and
Dr. Solomon's) all detect it for what it is.  It is said that AV companies
get the viruses that you write within days (usually) of the first time they
are distributed from a site like mine. Usually from someone who has become
infected with the virus and sends them an infected file.  Well more than
likely what are the guys in the virus lab gonna think when they first scan
the file and it shows up as the EICAR file?  Well one of 2 things, and I
think the latter of the 2 is more than likely what will occur until they
learn otherwise.  The first being that they might do a disassembly of the
file and see what they can find in the code. Or they might let the file
loose on a hospitol computer and see if they can replicate it.  While this
could happen, I tend to think that they probably see alot of EICAR
infections which would bring me to the second scenario, which they would
more than likely write it off at the fact that the person attached the
EICAR file to the file in question without even testing it for replication.
If this were the case, you could hide all kinds of heinous code behind this,
and it would prolong an AV program from detecting your new creation possibly.

        So now you have an Idea as to how this section will be filled in the
future.  Send in your revolutionary ideas and they will appear just like this
one did.

                ==============================================

Section Six - Naming Viruses

        So, you author viruses.  Do you name them before you write them or
after?  Well many name them before and many name them after.  But in all
reality, it dosn't really matter what you name them, as that name probably
isn't going to stick.  In other words, you, the author of the virus, don't
get to choose the name of your own creation.  Picture your wife carrying a
baby in her womb for 9 months.  With a little medical help at the hospitol,
the baby is delivered, and the Birthing papers are finished and all that,
and now comes the time you get to use that name that you perhaps spent months
deciding/arguing on.  Imagine if some baby naming organization came in and
decided they didn't like that name and stamped some generic name on your
child.  Pretty crazy huh?  Well that is how viruses get thier names, for the
most part.
        I know it is a great misnomer that the Author names the viruses.
But I will explain how viruses get thier names when it is thier time.  It
was explained to me by Dr. Alan Solomon himself, and it is really sort of a
strange process when you think about it.
        You author a virus, we will call it "Satan's Dumpster".  You spread
Satan's Dumpster to numerous Vx sites and via alt.comp.virus.source.code and
so on. Well your virus gets spread enough, and enough infections are reported
that it makes the "In The Wild List", well now that it is ready for
recognition by the AV community, it is time for Satan's Dumpster to get it's
REAL name.  Dr. Solomon described this process as a group of beer swilling
people who get together in a pub to talk about Viruses.  This group is known
as CARO.  They are the people who come up with the name of your virus.  They
will decide Satan's Dumpster will be called "Billy Goat".  Thus whenever
the AV companies decide it is time and the need is there to detect your
creation, it will detect it as the Billy Goat virus.  Nifty huh?
        You don't believe me?  Remember the HARE virus?  The original author
named it HDeuthanasia, by the time CARO got ahold of it, it became the HARE
virus. It was said it was named after a rabbit.  But it is apparent that it
was named after the chant which prints on your screen when the virus is
activated on your computer in relation to the Hari Krishna religion.  If
that is not enough for you, howabout the Bizatch virus.  It is now detected
as the BOZA virus.  So before you spend hours and hours thinking of some
clever new name for your virus, remember that in the end, that probably wont
be the name of the virus.

                ==============================================

Section Seven - Government Sites & Viruses & The Law

        Dr. Solomon's Virus & Computer Crime related law page is interesting
as well as a good resource for you that care about what laws, if any you are
breaking.  The page has The federal laws for the United States of America, as
well as the various state laws (which are more harsh and relate to those of
you who reside in a particular state more), as well as laws in the UK and a
few other countries.  If your country isn't listed and you know the laws,
you might visit his site and drop him a line so he can get them posted.
        The Federal law(s) in the United States are pretty straightforward,
and don't really effect you unless you are targeting the government.  They
state that you are not breaking a federal law, unless you harm a computer of
thiers, or one they have interest in.
        Well that is fine and dandy, but most of the state laws are much
harsher, but still are only a slap on the wrist. In my state (Oregon)
for example, I believe spreading viruses to a big business, such as say
Intel for example, is only a Class B Felony. A Class B felony is a small hit
for someone without a prior record.  But then you have to remember that this
is only 1/2 of the trouble you would get into.  This would be the criminal
trial.  After that is said and done, I am sure Intel would take me to court
on a Civil trial and make me poor for hundreds of years if were to live that
long.  Provided they could prove thier case in a court of law.
        So if you are not sure what laws, if any, you are breaking, you
may want to visit Dr. Solomon's and find out.  The reason I recommend his
site is because you don't need a degree in criminal law or a latin translator
to understand the laws on his page.  You also don't have to wade through an
entire Law Library to find what you are looking for, like some of the other
law sites on the net.  There is a direct link on my site which will take you
there, or you can look above in Phreex's Site list in the previous section
and get the URL for the site.
        So what does the AV industry think of our sites?  Well in the Usenet,
they would have you believe that our sites are the tool of Satan (or insert
your social/religious equivilant of the Antichrist here) and Virus Authors
are not relevant to the existance of the AV industry as it is today.
I personally think this is bullshit, but who am I, right?  What does the
government think of our sites.  Well I guess that depends on where you live.
The federal government of the U.S. dosn't really give a shit personally.  And
A branch of them, the CIAC, has actually written me, after visiting my site,
and requested that I put a link to thier site on my page.  I have done so,
because there is information there which some might find useful, *AND*
because they were civil in thier e-mail and recognized that sites like mine
will exist whether they want then to or not, and that they can actually give
them a jump on disinfecting viruses as they come out.
        The AV companies tend to say they will not use our sites, but I still
read every now and then in alt.comp.virus, that there are many informants
between the AV world and the Vx world.  Which tends to make me think that
our sites are used.
        If I were to send them a Vx dropper file, they would probably
incorporate it in thier next version of AV software.  They keep telling me
that Viruses that make the ITW (In the Wild) list are ones that are spread
widely.  Well alot of viruses that are spread widely never make that list
that appear on my site, The Alliance's site, or any other heavy traffic
sites.  So this theory has proved inaccurate, or that whoever keeps the ITW
list is lazy or waiting for a media frenzy before adding to the list. A site
like mine will get anywhere from 200-1000 hits a day, maybe more. And the
downloads are unreal.  In a week I think a virus can be pretty well wide-
spread, at least to fit thier definition of "widespread". But they never
appear. But then, what was the virus renamed to huh?
