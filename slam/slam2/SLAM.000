Welcome to SLAM issue 2!  As you may have noticed, we are a little
late in releasing this issue.  This is mainly because some of our
members leave the group and some new joined in. This second release
is, in our eyes, much better then the first. It contains now not
only wordbasic code. We have about 20 articles over asm and some pascal,
c and vba codes, too. So, I think we have something for everyone.

AuroDreph, Cyborg and Virtual Daemon must be commended for their great
job of doing all the programming for this edition. The viewer's are really
good. Thankz Members!

SLAM has grown in size and quality since the first Evolution came
out a few months ago.  We've had some good members drop out for various
reasons but we've also got some new members. The group left have
The Underground Prophet and Virtual Boy. Our new members are Death Knight,
Virtual Daemon, DarkSide and Hyperlock.

Our next SLAM Issue will probably come out in 2 months, so make sure
to look at our distribution points for the latest news and SLAM magazines.
