That's a good question. I still don't know it.

In this Issue we used two viewers. A Win95 and a Dos viewer.
If you think we shouldn't do that again in SLAM 3 or you think we
should better make it with Html and Java then send us a mail to

slam@presidency.com.

Another question is the kind of viruses in our next Issue.
Should we write more about ASM viruses or Macro Viruses and
would you like to read more interviews or more article about
infection and anti-heuristic techniques?
That's important questions that we must know.

So, please contact us and say what you want.
