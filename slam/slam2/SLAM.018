                  Quick and Easy Virus Host File Generator
                               by Gothmog/DHA

Lots of times when I'm working on my latest virus, I find the need to infect
a host file to see if the virus is working correctly. And to make such a
host file, I don't want to use a program with cumbersome command-line options
or mess with debug, which while easy, is still a pain when you want to get
something done. So, for fast results, I cooked up this batch file system. The
main batch file, MAKEHOST.BAT, creates a virus host file by piping a script,
MAKEHOST.SCR, through debug. Quick and simple, not much else to it, but I've
found it quite useful, as it's fast and easy to use. I recommend copying both
files to your DOS directory, but any directory in your path is fine.

== cut here =========================================== file: MAKEHOST.BAT ==
@echo off
echo. > %1
debug %1 < c:\dos\makehost.scr > nul
echo.
== file ends ==================================================== cut here ==

And the debug script file; modify the actual host to suit your needs, this
one is fine in most cases, unless you're dealing with a virus that has a min-
imum file size check or one that uses more than the first four bytes in its
infection routine, for example.

== cut here =========================================== file: MAKEHOST.SCR ==
e 100 90 90 CD 20
r cx
4
w
q
== file ends ==================================================== cut here ==

That's it... Bug off.                                             Gothmog/DHA
