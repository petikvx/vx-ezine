   Also greetz to all of you who should have been on this list, but you aren't
 because of my stupidity. You all have my respect.
   Greetings also goes to the old parents of the VX scene: Dark Angel, Dark
 Avenger, Neurobasher, Qark, Mnemonix, NoWhere Man, Talon (RIP) etc, the old
 virus crews: Phalcon/Skism, VLAD, Trident, NuKE, AIH, ARCV, etc, aswell as
 all the existing groups from the scene. Special greetings to Feathered
 Serpents, who will probably become the most popular and elite virus team.
 We, the SLAM staff, wish them good luck!
