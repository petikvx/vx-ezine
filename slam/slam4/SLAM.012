  DISCLAIMER

  This is not a technical article, only a brief comment about RTF. If you're a
newbie in macro stuff then you will understand this easily! ;)


--============--
  INTRODUCTION
--============--

  When you run an Antivirus, it usually uses (whithout scanning All Files,just
the Program Files) the following extensions to search for Word macroviruses:

- .DOC (Word document)
- .DOT (Word template)

  But a few antiviruses search for this extension too:

- .RTF (Rich Text Format)

  If a RTF file has been infected by a macrovirus then if you run an Antivirus
and search for viruses without the "all files" option enabled, maybe your AV
will not search the .RTF extension and, of course, it won't be able to detect
the macrovirus. I've tested many Antivirus programs and i was very surprised
because most of them do NOT search for the .RTF extension.

  WTF is RTF? ;-)
--===============--

  RTF (Rich Text Format) is a form of encoding various text formats, document
structures, and document properties. It uses the printable ASCII character
set. Special characters can be also be thus encoded, although RTF does not
prevent the utilization of character codes outside the ASCII printable set.
It enables programs to export an ASCII file containing text and format
information combined. The exported information can be read by any other
program, like Micro$ux Word, which allows you to import RTF format files.

for example a RTF file can keep these features:
-  Bold
-  Italic
-  Underline
-  Strikeout
-  Text colors
-  Font size


  The following is a dump of a sample of RTF file (created with M$-Word):

     INFECTION PART
--====================--

  Now, for see how a RTF file has been infected by a macrovirus you need:

1) A RTF document (you can create one with your WordPad or WinWord or with
                 your favorite word processor. Use the "Save As..." option,
                 and select: "Rich Text Format"
  (*) if you use WinWord to create a RTF file, be sure that your M$-Word's
      global template is free macros else your RTF isn't clean. Just delete
      the NORMAL.DOT before you run WinWord.

2) Micro$uck Word (use M$-Word english version or your native language
             version: French, dutch, italian, polish, etc.)

3) A piece of WordBasic code which Save the current document as template.

   example:

   Macro: AutoOpen

   Sub Main
      ......            ' ur code ;)
      FileSaveAs .Format = 1    ' convert to template
      Macrocopy .....   'copy your macro
   End Sub

  Of course you can use another way of WordBasic like Organizer, only you need
to save the file as Template (remember in Word a document=0, a Template=1)

  If you have the tree conditions then open the RTF document which M$-Word
infected already. When you open/close the RTF file , it is infected and
converted in Word template by effect of the macrovirus, only the format is
converted, the extension is the same RTF.



                                    Filename.RTF
                                  +--------------+
                                  !              !
     Before Infection---------->  !     RTF      !
                                  !   document   !
                                  !              !
                                  +--------------+



                                    Filename.RTF
                                  +--------------+
                                  !              !
     After Infection----------->  !     Word     !
                                  !   template   !
                                  !              !
                                  +--------------+


  Of course the RTF structure is missing and has been replaced by Word Template
structure.
  Well, you can see now, the only process is the code that converts the RTF
to template. Open the document like binary file with your EDIT.EXE for
windoze 95 and you will see just Word Streams.


--==========--
  FINAL NOTE
--==========--

  Well, now run your antivirus and search whithout "all files" option the
.RTF file infected. If the AV can't detect anything then you can easily send
infected Word documents to people which usa the same Antivirus as yourself.
You only have to rename the infected Word document:

            Filename.DOC ---> Filename.RTF

  Btw, if an Aver reads this article then he will include the .RTF extension
in the search extension by default. Else many people are going to send
e-mails with .RTF files infected (or renamed Word Documents to RTF) in the
attachment. :-P
