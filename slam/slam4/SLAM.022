                            Version 0.1 for SLAM

  Hello. This is my tut on coding viruses with ASIC. For SLAM!
  Now, before I even start, there's a few things you need to know about coding
viruses in ASIC. 1st, coding a virus in ASIC is actually a very time consuming
project. You don't have the low-level abilities that you do with ASM, so you
will have to write your own routines for certain functions. It is assumed that
you have some programming skills already. I will be including example source
code for some things. I will not be including (a) the asic compiler (b) libs
(yes, You will be using certain libs) or (c) a linker. If you cannot find these 
things, e-mail SLAM, and I will have them forwarded to you. Since I'm not 
providing any libs with this article, I'll provide source code that for the 
most part doesn't need them.

  I suppose, you're wondering, well what kind of viruses can I write with asic?
  The answer is prependers (which I will explain how to write) or overwriters
(which aren't even worth explaining).

  Some overview on what a prepender is, and how it works:
  A prepender is a virus that places itself in the beginning of the file, IE
the entire virus overwrites the data already there. What makes this different
from an overwriter is, a prepender saves this data elsewhere (Ie: end of the
file) before overwriting it. In this way, the file data can be restored and 
your virus can run the infected file. Now, some prependers use a temporary file
to store the hosts original data while it's working, and just write the host
at the end. This makes the virus extremely slow. Since it has to read/write
Most if not all of the host. The second type of prepender writes just it's
body, and the same amount of bytes as the data it replaces. Like so:

Original Uninfected program:

----Program

Infected Program:
Virus+someprogramdata+data_that_was_where_the_virus_now_sits

  As you can see, a 5k virus (yes, 5k.. Smaller if you don't use any detailed
payloads, or code the payload in pure asm instead of asic) will read/write
10k per file it infects. Once you infect a file, How do you pass control to it
to make it work again? Thats a very good question. That works like this:

- user runs program
- virus actually loads
- virus reads an image of itself from host
- virus infects some programs
- virus then reads stored data from host (usually at the end, minus virus size)
- decrypts it if needbe
- puts data in front of host, overwriting virus code (Don't panic)
- trims off data it put at the end of the host during infection
- virus then Spawns or shells to host, passing any command line parameters
- once host has returned to the operating system, Dormant virus regains control
  and proceeds to reinfect host, and possibly search for newly created files
  to infect.
- virus terminates.

  One odd thing about this method, since you restore the host to it's original
condition, you have a slight Host Stealth ability. Meaning, if the host happens
to check it's condition on disk, it won't notice any changes, F-prot self check
for example.

  A quick rundown of infection:
- virus determines the executed filename containing it
- reads an image of itself. (since  you can't point to cx:0000 in asic)
- virus searches for a file to infect (exe or com,  both can be infected, yes
  you can infect coms too, even though your virus will be structurly an exe)
- virus reads in data from the target file equal to it's size
- stores this at the end of the target, encrypted beforehand if needbe
- virus then copies it's image into the front of the target.
- virus looks for more files to infect.

  Asic viruses because you will likely use it's Dim command, will get about
40k after compiling, and unless you feel like manually inserting encrypted
text withen them, you will be doing some hex editing after compiling.
Once this is all done, Your not quite finished, You need an exe compressor
such as pklite (not recommended) lzexe or rjcrush.

  And once you finally compress your virus, then you can change the source
code to reflect the viruses final size. Since, you cannot guess ahead of time
how big your exe will be, when all is said and done.

  I promised source code, and it's provided below. And, to save you some time
I've already compiled it, and provided an exe as well. I will not explain each
asic command withen the source code, Asic has excellent online help for that.
And, you should be able to locate atleast the compiler without much hassle.
I used version 5 for this virus.

  If there is interest in this method of virus programming, I'll write more
articles concerning virus coding with this language.
