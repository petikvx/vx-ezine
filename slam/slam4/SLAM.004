   Every article from this electronical magazine, has been released for
 educational purposes only. All the articles were verified and tested, so
 all the stuff should work. WE TAKE ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSABILITY FOR ANY
 DAMAGES or SIDE EFECTS THAT MIGHT RESULT BY RUNNING ANY OF OUR VIRUSES.
 We do NOT support the DISTRIBUTION of COMPUTER VIRUSES, as well as
 DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS. Everything we do, we do it for its beauty and not to
 get famous or anything. Viruses are just simple source codes for us, and not
 malicious parasites that must fuck up others computers.
   Some of us have worked hard in order to provide you with these codes, so
 you should consider that when you'll use samples of our code. We do not want
 greetings or anything else... just use our stuff to learn, and not to
 destroy computer data.

   As you already might have noticed, there is a ZIP file attached to our mag:
 BINARIES.ZIP. This archive contains all our viruses in binary formes (already
 compiled), aswell as some utilites/programs that you'll (probably) going
 to need in order to compile our codes. The ZIP file is password protected.
 We choosed to do that, so you can first read this article and then unzip the
 files. WARNING: All the VIRUSES from our archive (BINARIES.ZIP) are in
 EXE/COM/BIN format, so if you're not really sure what the hell a computer
 virus is, or what could be the consequences of running one, I suggest you
 to LEAVE the fuck those files there! Don't be a smart ass, because if you
 don't know what you're doing, you might pay later.
 The password for the BINARIES.ZIP archive is: "slamviruses" (without the "").

   Enjoy reading our mag! Any opinion about our zine (good or bad) is welcome!
