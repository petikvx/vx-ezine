We were having a problem with a computer at a client's office. Have come
to find out that his son was trying to learn how to "make a virus" by
disabling VirusScan and downloading as many different viruses he could
find. Things got away from him and the computer began to have load problems.
When I got involved, I clean booted and used Virus Scan. It identified and
cleaned 84 different viruses. (Yes, that was eighty - four). After clean
boot I started WIN95 and began having problems. No CDROM was identified,
the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files were changed. A "Safe Boot" worked only once
after which I got a 3x5 white box with the following inside it.
"Rusty Bug...........................CaSio USA". Now I can not get any of
the floppy drives to work for a clean boot. The system boots goes through
a load of some type, and, tells me that there is insufficent memory and
either locks or leaves me at a C prompt. I can't interupt the load with
control C or control break. Sometimes at the C prompt I can do a dir and
access some of the drive. It won't let me run SCAN ! Any idea's short of
FDISK and re-install. Thanks Lou

     This virus is a com/exe infector. It can only spread by executing
     a file that it has infected. The only way to clean this virus
     out is to DELETE THE FILE it is infecting and replace the file
     with a backup.

     The only way I can see that this would keep you from booting is
     if it infected any of your startup commands. There is
     something else keeping you from booting, I doubt it is a virus.

     The floppy drives are not affected by any loaded programs. I
     would check the system bios and make sure that the floppy
     drive A: is set to boot first before the C: drive.

  Hehehe :-), imagine... you have to backup all your programs, because McAfee
can't remove the Rustybug & Krile virus families (viruses created by RAiD/SLAM
written in ASIC)... That's hard work excepting the situation when you got a
better AntiVirus or you've bought a good Backup program.... }:-D

What happened to McAfee guys?...err, NAI guys (yep, i remember that they merged
at network associates). They still have problems cleaning HLLT viruses. I've
tested RustyBug variant of 5330 bytes and other AVs like AVP are able to detect
& remove it. On the other hand, McAfee just shows: "no current remover
avaliable"! pfff...(I've tested it with the latest VirusScan 3.16 and latest
datafile 3104)

  Nowadays, an efficient antivirus needs to detect and remove every present
virus. In our "almighty" Internet, viruses are a treath, because you can easily
send via e-mail an infected program O:-) .
PS: Don't forget that RAiD's viruses are able to infect Windows and DOS files.
