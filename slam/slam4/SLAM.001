                      อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

   There are several places on Internet where you can find our e-zine. A
 short list with some of them follows:

 ๚ The Official SLAM Virus Team WebPage:
     http://xylia.theriverstyx.net/~slam/         (FAST! -> T10 connection)
 ๚ Cicatrix's HomePage:
     http://www.cyberstation.net/~cicatrix/
 ๚ Aurodreph's Cattle:
     http://www.ilf.net/AURODREPH/virus.htm
 ๚ KidChaos's HomePage:
     http://members.xoom.com/kidchaos

   These are the fastest sites I can think off right now. Besides them, there
 are a certain number of BBS systems aswell as other Internet pages that host
 our mag.
   To all the SysOps that mailed me: due to some hard drive crashes, I have
 lost your mails guys... :( If any of you are still interested in distributing
 our zine and wanna be listed here, please mail me again. Also, all of you
 out there who would like to join this distribution list, don't hesitate to
 contact me.

   As you can see, the SLAM Virus Team FINALLY got its Official WebPage. All
 the events and news will be posted on our main page from now on. So, be sure
 to check it. Also, SLAM will probably get a domain name soon, so check all
 the http://www.slam.??? addresses periodically to find out :) We'll keep you
 informed anyway.
