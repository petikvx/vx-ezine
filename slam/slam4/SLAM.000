   Welcome to SLAM Magazine issue #4! After many delays and many internal
 problems, aswell as external, we managed to finish (in a great hurry) the 4th
 issue of our e-zine: SLAM Magazine - The X Document.
   It's been almost 10 months since we released our last issue (#3), and to
 be oughnest with you, there were times when we thaught that #4 won't see
 the light of the day. We were just too darn busy (time is money, huh?) to
 finish anything worth releasing.
                                                               \|||/
  What the hell happened with SLAM?                            (o o)
 ®ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄooOÄ(_)ÄOooÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   A lot of things happened since SLAM #3. We could actually say, that the old
 SLAM team is dead and that a new team has reborned over its ashes and dust.
 The SLAM memberlist has been changed DRAMATICALLY since #3. Just go ahead and
 read the membership article... You'll see for yourself that I'm right.
   The most important loss for our team was the retirement of Nightmare Joker,
 who was practically the founder of SLAM. He was just too busy with his life,
 and he decided to leave the scene for a while or... for ever. Good luck man,
 wherever you are!
   Also, after #3, due to their complete laziness, many members were kicked
 out from SLAM, just for the simple fact that they haven't done anything for
 the group and/or for our zine.
   Like IndianOwl said to me one day, I "ripped off the fat from SLAM". Yes,
 that's true. If you can't find the time to do something in a group, then
 you probably don't belong there (IMHO).

   Due to some internal conflicts with AVers, DarkSide1 decided to retire from
 SLAM and from the virus scene. Also, Cyborg, Hyperlock and Lord of nAvAn
 couldn't find the time to continue their work in SLAM, and they also decided
 to retire and to continue their lives. Guys, we wish you only the best!

   So, after #3, the only members left in SLAM were Aurodreph, CyberYoda, Dark
 Chakal, Stealth Warrior and me, Virtual Daemon. Now you can see why I said
 that SLAM is practically a new TEAM now.

   BUT, since every bad thing has its bright side, after the release of our
 3rd issue, SLAM's got some awsome new members. They are (in order of their
 entrance): KidChaos, Raid (aka RustBug or Casio), Trigger, Forms, Darx Kies,
 Shaitan, Yesna and finally Blue Skull. They are all asm coders, except
 KidChaos who is curently (today May 1th 1998 ;) a macro coder and Raid who
 is half asm/half ASIC (cross between basic and asm) programmer.

   Along with our memberlist changes, SLAM changed its "profile" too. Those of
 you who read our previous issues, saw that we were getting on the asm road
 faster and faster. This way, SLAM evolved from a pure macro coding group
 (Special issue and issue #1) to a half macro-half asm (issue #2 and issue #3)
 group. Now we are proud to say that SLAM has finished its transformation
 process, and has actually grown up into a complete virus coding team.

  SLAM #4: what's hot and what's not
 ®ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
   This issue contains about 80% asm codes and tutorials and only about 20%
 macro stuff. As you will see by reading it, we concentrated almost all our
 efforts to "educate the masses". SLAM #4 contains about 10 tutorials (or even
 more), so I guess the non-viral comunity/beginners will enjoy reading it.
   But besides the great amount of tutorials/technical papers, SLAM #4 brings
 you some other cool stuff too. We have some nice multi-OS viruses (Raid and
 Shaitan have bringed their contribution to this ;), some quite nice asm codes
 and some of the finest WM viruses.
   We do not claim that any of these codes are good. In fact, we don't claim
 that even WE are good. It all depends on you dear reader, to judge us.

   Unfortunatly, we released #4 in a GREAT hurry, thus some things may not be
 perfect. Only about 40% of the things we wanted to be in #4 are there. I just
 hope we'll find the time in the future to bring you that other 60%.

   But enough rambling about... Just go and read the articles! We hope you'll
 enjoy them.
