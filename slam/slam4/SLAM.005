   I linked two editorial articles together, because they're both very related
 one to another.

   Our Official WebPage is http://xylia.theriverstyx.net/~slam/. We will get
 our own domain name soon, so probably all our e-mail addresses will change.
 We'll keep you posted about that anyway. Just visit our HomePage regullary.

   SLAM Virus Team is *STILL* an open group. That means, that anyone who has
 the skills and the will, can join us. Since we're ONLY VIRUS ORIENTED, we
 do not need hackers/phreackers or any other type of codes. We can only accept
 in virus coders. So, those who would like to join our team, please send an
 e-mail with your best code (viral related) and some basic stuff about you
 (handle, country, etc) to virtual_daemon@hotmail.com. (DO NOT SENT ANY MORE
 OLD MEMBERSHIP FORMS!). I'm checking my e-mail on hotmail almost every day
 (unlike my psynet address, who will be a bit ingored in the future), so I
 should get and read all your mails in time.
   Thanks to all the guys who mailed me after #3... my INBOX was "filled up"
 almost every day. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to answer to all your mails.
 I will try to do my best in the future.

 What's next?
 ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

   SLAM #4 took us a bit more than we've expected. And that's not because we
 were too lame to code our viruses, but just for the simple fact that we were
 too busy with our personal lives. From now on, we'll try to do better.
   I've received many e-mails (thanks again guys! :) about SLAM #3, and it
 seems that most of our readers enjoy our mag in this form: two separate
 viewers, one for Windows95 (or better) and one for DOS. That is why we'll
 keep this form of organization for our viewers.

   At this point we're not sure if there will be a SLAM #5 or not. Things
 might work out tho, and probably (we do hope so) there will be another zine
 with the "SLAM" signature on it. We still haven't showed to the scene our
 true face.
   What else can I say? Just look at SLAM #4 as the FIRST issue of the NEW
 SLAM Virus Team. Our "second one" (issue #5) will be much better hopefully.

   Darx Kies has decided to retire from the virus scene two days ago :(((
 Here goes a short explanation from himself:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Well guys, I kinda have to retire.
  A couple of you know that I coded RMC.1551, that was 5 years ago or so, and
in the body of the virus is my real name and an old address. When I 'released'
the virus, I didn't thought that it would ever spread out of Romania.
  Last year I wanted to know if it was known and to my surprise it was. I found
nowhere anything about the payload and that was good. But as I talked to r-
and told him that I coded RMC.1551 he told me my real name and he found it on
the AVP HP.
  I don't want to get in prison or something. :( That's why SLAM Bros you
didn't see no virii code from me. I wanted to make something for SLAM and I
worked with VD on the DOS Viewer and I coded the WIN Viewer. I will also
improve the SLAM HP in the near future with some code and I hope Trg will help
me with some GFX. ;)

  Greetz go to
  VD         - SLAM la putere !!!
