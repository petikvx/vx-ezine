Welcome to the first issue of the SLAM Magazine, this magazine has as
subtitle  "The Document X".  I'm sure this is just the beginning of a
magazine, it will continue until no one reads it anymore or if we are
to lazy to continue it. But I think that that will not yet happen :-)
This isn't a magazine that has a standard time between two magazines,
but I think it will take a couple of months to write the next one. So
make sure to look at our distribution points  for the latest news and
SLAM magazines.  Also make sure  to check out  the VBB magazines  for
more  about some of us.  And for more info about  the group or  us as
individuals check the latest Viral Database (VDAT) from Cicatrix. See
our distribution points  for his homepage,  where you can download or
even read online his latest VDAT. Another thing I suggest to you, for
the rumors and other things that has happened in the Virus World,  is
the latest  God@rky Newsletter,  it's real good,  you get  the latest
news about what happened in the scene and that kinda stuff.  Also see
our distribution points to get the God@rky newsletter.

We suffered a big loss in the virus scene lately: VLAD has quit. They
were one of the best virus groups out there.  It looks like everybody
quits these days, first Phalcom/Skism then NuKE (what a shame :)) and
now VLAD. But a good thing that has  happened lately is that Immortal
Riot merged with  Genesis and that they created one of the best virus
groups out there called IRG, Immortal Riot/Genesis.

But he, for the ones who think that VBB is dead. I've got great news,
there were much things happening lately around VBB.  First they got a
couple of  new members,  I'm one of them. And more important,  A time
ago  Dark Night was e-mailed by  Liquid Cool.  A  hacker/phreaker who
was with  Triple Six  (A hacker/phreaker/etc. group)  until they  got
busted. When Triple Six saw that VBB wasn't doing so well he tried to
contact  Dark Night and said  that it maybe was a good idea to create
some sort of a sub-group in VBB that was about hacking and that kinda
stuff. Liquid Cool could create files to explain how to hack sometin.
So watch out for VBB #4 that will be out soon.

Back to SLAM.  This first issue of SLAM  is mainly about Macro Virii,
because our assembler coderz hadn't had the time to work at the first
issue,  next time there will be probably more assembler shit in here,
so those assembler coderz out there have to wait.

Another thing  I wanna say is,  our english isn't that good,  because
no one from  the SLAM crew is from  a english speakin country.  But I
hope you can understand what we are talkin about. But eh, don't blame
us, we are coderz not english teachers or something.
