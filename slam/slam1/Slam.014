WHAT'S NEXT
-----------

Ofcourse there will be a SLAM issue 2. I think about two months.
It will be the usual new techniques and lots of virus shit.

But for the techniques:
- If the AV-lamers ever make a heuristic macro scanner, we've got
  some ideas to avoid the heuristic scanning. Some sort of anti-
  heuristic.

- Improved retro.

- Polymorfism without numbers in the macro name.

- Any articles you send to us.

And for the other SLAM stuff:
- Interviews with SLAM membas and members from other groups.

- Improved viewers.


And lots of other things we and you come up with...
