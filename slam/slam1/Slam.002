FIRST INFO ABOUT MACRO VIRII
----------------------------

A computer virus has lots of correspondences with biological virii
(plural of virus).
I will present a list with correspondences:

Computer virii                      | Biological virii

with uninfecting you system.        | virii.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are lots of more comparisons with biological virii. Imagine...
At the moment there are 2 main types of computer virii:

                1.  Virii created in assembler (or other program languages,
                    but most of the time in assembler). Created for Dos
                    or sometimes for windows (Bizatch, etc.)
                2.  Virii created in MS-Word macro's (or other programs 
                    that have a good macro language) This sort will be 
                    the subject of this file. 
                    
The second type are the newest virii and spread much more faster then
the first type.

Macro virii (the second type) are created with Microsoft Word for 
Windows 6.0 or higher, you may think how can I create a virus with 
a MS-Word? 
MS-Word has a build in macro language, a macro language is almost the
same as a programmer language (such as C++, Pascal, etc.). The MS-WORD
macro language is a simple version of Visual Basic (a programmers 
language. It's not very hard
to learn, only I never found the perfect book about Word macros.
                   
An assembler virus (type 1) attaches himself to an executable file such
as .EXE and .COM, a Word macro virus (type 2) Doesn't attaches himself 
to .EXE or .COM files, but to .DOC files (the standard MS-Word type). You 
might think, how can a .DOC file with text be infected?
See the following picture for more info. 

  Normal Word Document (.DOC)
    +--------------------+
    | Text + text-format |
    +--------------------+

  Word Template (doesn't matter which extension, .DOT is often used)
    +------------------------------------------+
    | Text + text-format + macros + Word setup |                               
    +------------------------------------------+                                

Word virii are created in macros, so if you want to
create a macro virus you must be sure that the file is saved as a
Word template, because in Word templates you can save macros. But
the only problem is that Word templates are almost always saved as
.DOT. So we must change the FileSaveAs program that it will save Word
templates as .DOC.

What is a macro?
A macro is a sort of a list of things that MS-Word will do auto-
maticcly when the macro is run.

Maybe it's going a bit fast now, so we'll take it all over now, but
if you almost fallen asleap because you already knew everything, go
on with SLAM.003 and enjoy...

A summary of what we had till now:

 - There are 2 types of virii:
        -Assembler virii, mostly for DOS
        -Winword virii, a new type of virii created with the macro language
         of Microsoft Word 6.0 or higher

 - A Word virus is created in a macro, a list of instruction that MS-Word 
   can do automatticly when a macro is run.
 
 - Word can only save macros in templates so you must make sure that Word
   saves every infected file as a template.


Ok that was that. We have the basics of a macro virus here. Now we'll go
on with a specific macro virus, the Concept macro virus. It was the first
macro virus and is probably the most in the wild virus.

In Word you can see if there are any macros installed. You do this with
selecting the Tools/Macros. You then get a dialogbox with the names of
the macros installed in the Normal.dot, Normal.dot is the template where
Word saves its settings in and stores his macros in that are created or
copied to the Normal.dot. Because Word automaticly opens the Normal.dot 
when Word is opened we must make sure to copy the virus macros to the 
Normal.dot.

If you understand everything till here you can read on. Otherwise you
may consider reading it again from the start.

We'll continue our journey in creating macro virii with looking at the
first Word macro virus, Concept. Because Concept is just a simple Word
macro virus we'll start with this virus. It's detected by all AV-progs
I know about but you must learn to walk before you can do the Polka!

The Concept Macro Virus
-----------------------
Before you going to do all the stuff down here it's good to
do the following things:

-Make a backup of the Normal.dot from \winword\template\normal.dot
-It's handy to install the WordBasic help file too

Concept uses 5 different macros to infect and spread. The names of these
macros are:
               
               - AAAZAO     (a copy of the AutoOpen macro)
               - AAAZFS     (becomes the FileSaveAs macro)
               - AutoOpen   (is automaticly executed when doc is opened)
               - FileSaveAs (changes the fileSaveAs dialog so it will save 
                             as a template, but with a .doc extension)
               - PayLoad    (is the infection marker, this macro doesn't do
                             anything, it's just for fun)

In word macro virii the following happens when anyone gets infected:

                1.  You open an infected template (document)
                2.  The AutoOpen macro in the infected template (document)
                    copies all the virus macros from the template (document)
                    to the Normal.dot
                3.  The virus macros changes the FileSaveAs  dialog so
                    that it will save every (normal) document you
                    want to save but changes it into a template and saves
                    the macros of the virus in the document

This happens with almost every macro virii. There are exclusions, but I
will explain these in later files.
Back to Concept.
The virus uses 5 macros, but if you look in an infected document (not the
Normal.dot), with Tools/Macros you will see only 4. You might think: How
the fuck is that possible??? 
It's not very hard to explain:
It's quite logical. If you use an infected document (not the Normal.dot) 
you'll see the 4 macros:
                             - AAAZAO
                             - AAAZFS
                             - AutoOpen
                             - PayLoad
And if you look at an infected Normal.dot you'll see:
                             - AAAZAO
                             - AAAZFS
                             - FileSaveAs
                             - PayLoad

You see that there isn't any AutoOpen macro in the Normal.dot. That's
because it isn't nessecary, because nobody opens his Normal.dot manually.
But if it's opened if you start Word the AutoOpen macro won't run auto-
maticly. We'll come to this later. But in the infected document the
AutoOpen macro is probably the most important macro. Because it does
the actual infection of the Normal.dot. I'll show you later how the
macro works. The PayLoad macro in the infected document is the same as
in the infected Normal.dot and only contains a message:
  "That's enough to prove my point"
It further has no use.
The AAAZAO is a copy of the AutoOpen macro and the AAAZFS macro is a
copy of the FileSaveAs macro. The use of these macros are explained in
the drawing down here. 

  The macros that are copied to the Normal.dot when AutoOpen is executed

    +--Infected document---+
    | AAAZAO --------------+--------+
    | AAAZFS --------------+-----+  |
    | AutoOpen             |     |  |
    | PayLoad -------------+--+  |  |
    +----------------------+  |  |  |
                              |  |  |
    +--Normal.dot----------+  |  |  |
    | PayLoad <------------+--+  |  |
    | FileSaveAs <---------+-----+  |
    | AAAZFS <-------------+--------+-|
    | AAAZAO <-------------+--------+-|
    +----------------------+

You saw that AAAZFS is copied to AAAZFS and to FileSaveAs and AutoOpen was
not. That's because it is running. You cannot copy any macro that is
running. That's why FileSaveAs isn't copied when saving a document
(and infect the document) because FileSaveAs is running. In stead of
FileSaveAs, AAAZFS is copied. AAAZFS has the same contents as FileSaveAs.
As you will see later.
Because AutoOpen isn't copied to the Normal.dot you must have another
macro that has the same contents as the AutoOpen macro to infect other
documents that aren't infected yet, because the infected document must
have an AutoOpen macro in it to infect other computers. Got it? Here's
another drawing to show you what happens if you save an uninfected
document, with the FileSaveAs macro.

  The macros that are copied to the uninfected document when FileSaveAs
  is executed. 

    +--Normal.dot----------+
    | AAAZAO --------------+--------+
    | AAAZFS --------------+-----+  |
    | FileSaveAs           |     |  |
    | PayLoad -------------+--+  |  |
    +----------------------+  |  |  |
                              |  |  |
    +--Uninfected document-+  |  |  |
    | PayLoad <------------+--+  |  |
    | AAAZFS <-------------+-----+  |
    | AutoOpen <-----------+--------+-|
    | AAAZAO <-------------+--------+-|
    +----------------------+

I hope you got it. Now the final thing before we going to see the macros
and their contents of the Concept macro virus.

Every virus must have a see-if-already-infected-thing in it. Because if it
tries to infect a file for the second time you will see all kind off strange
error messages. This counts for assembler virii and ofcourse for Word macro
virii.

Don't quit now if you don't understand a thing of it, most of you will
not understand it right now. I will discuss the macros now.
You probably have seen that the macros FileSaveAs and AAAZFS are the same.
The macros AutoOpen and AAAZAO are the same to. It's quite logical because
the AAAZFS gets copied to the FileSaveAs and the AAAZAO is copied to the
AutoOpen macro. So because of the two same macros I will only discuss two
macros with you, the FileSaveAs and AutoOpen, more is not neccesary.
If your Normal.dot has the Concept macros you can easily watch them by
clicking    Tools/Macro---->"choose macro you want to view" and click Edit

Here follows the macros AutoOpen and FileSaveAs again only now with more
explanation, I hope you get it now.

The Macro virus Concept is included with this SLAM issue in the file
Concept.zip

Enjoy creating your first macro virus and learn from the WordBasic help
file and books. You can read on with the mag if you want but it's
probably better if you first learn something more about the Word macro
language WordBasic.
