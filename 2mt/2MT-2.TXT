***NOTE: 2MT has changed thier name from "2 Much Thinking" to
"2 Many Thoughts".  We have kept it 2MT for file naming purposes but the
name has changed.  Who cares right.  Well just changing the name so we
can sound more mature.  I don't want NuKE calling us lame.

2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT-2MT

        Lame... that is such a harsh word.  Whoever thought that up must
have been a real looser.  Anyways that word has been used quite a bit in
the BBS world to day.

                   "So and So is lame and I am Elite"

        Please.  The reason why it is so accepted in today's society is
1) because the bbs world is composed of mainly school geeks and they all
love these intelectual words, and 2) because Elite people like NuKE use
it so everyone wants to be /<ool.

        Well the "Elite" group NuKE seems to use that word quite a bit
now adays.  Every new group that is put together is considered lame
until NuKE approves of them. We here at the 2MT HQ have composed a list
of things you can do if NuKE ever uses it on you.  Please feel free to
use one or all of the ideas mentioned.  They are all free.

What to do when NuKE calls you lame:

01. Change your alias.  Maybe then you can act as Elite as they do.
02. Write a large appology to them and try to kiss as much ass as you
    can.  Nowhere Man will enjoy that part, especially if your a male.
03. Go tell your mommy.
04. Tell me and I'll tell Rock Steady's mommy tonight.
05. Quit BBS'n.  Once NuKE says your a lamer.  Your always going to be
    one.
06. Join the WaReZ Scene.  You can blend in with the other lamers.
07. Start your own group so you can call NuKE lame.
08. Hold your breath and count to 50.  This will not only get rid of
    those damn hickups but will also get rid of NuKE.
09. Cry.
10. Make a virus from VCL.  Heck it may be a buggy virus and won't work
    but it will still be better than most of NuKE's viruses.
11. Call Patti Hoffman and tell her to change all occurances of NuKE in
    her VSUM to some immature word.
12. Ignore them.  This always seems to get rid of kids.  They will get
    bored and eventually leave you alone.
13. Write a long article talking about how lame they are and put it in
    your info jour.. I mean your Magazine.
14. Call Joseph Grec.. I mean Rock Steady voice and bitch to him.
15. Send each member a condomn.  They will all love you, now they don't
    have to clean the shit stains off their joystick.
16. Send each member a bone.  Their girlfriends will love you.
17. Send each member an inflatable girl.  That way they will have
    something to do with the bone you sent them in number 16.
18. Do a drive by egging on their houses.  Use the X-Tra large eggs
    because their splash capacity due to the gravitational pull and the
    earths rotational tilt will cause a greater eruption on the plane.
    In other words it will make more of a mess.
19. Read back issues of 2MT and take your mind off things.
20. Read back issues of NuKE's info journals.  Get a good laugh of Rock
    Steady trying to explain things he doesn't understand and NuKE's
    pascal trojans.  Then you'll know who's lame.
21. Write a virus with a lot of text in it stating who you are and the
    viruses name.  Distribute it everywhere and boast about it.  Then
    release 50 varients all having different text but the same code.  When
    NuKE see's this they can't say a thing because you can just show them
    the NuKE Pox series.
22. Ask Rock Steady to see all 94 of his viruses that he has created
    over the years.  This will shut him up for a while as he will have
    to write about 50 of them before showing you them.
23. Listen to some Metal music.  (A form of suicide)
24. Listen to some Techno Music. (A way of getting high)
25. Use those lame ass Nowhere Util's to crash a pirate board.  Make
    sure its a lame one because when you get caught (and you will) you
    will be deleted.
26. Go get a good fuck from your girl friend.
27. Go get a good fuck from NuKE's girl friends.  But don't bring
    anything sharp as the inflatable girls that you sent them back in
    number 17 will surely pop.
28. Then again don't fuck NuKE's girls.  They may be worn down from over
    use and eventually pop anyways.
29. Suck Rocko's dick.
30. Bring a tweaser to perform the task mentioned in number 29.
31. Put up a bbs and lock all NuKE members out.
32. Crash a NuKE bbs.  If you can crack that damn password in their lame
    IJ's to get the numbers to some.  If you can't then you truly are
    lame.
33. Upload all their viruses to McAffee and all as soon as they are
    released.  Ah forget it.  All their viruses get spread in their mag
    and nowhere else but boards for collecting.  There is no point to
    there group in the VX community.
34. Tell P/S that NuKE has been saying stuff about them therefore
    starting a war between the two groups and from there... well we all
    know that P/S will surely kick as.  P/S is respected more than NuKE
    because they act mature.
35. Continue Crying.
36. Throw a fit.
37. Pick a booger from your nose and stick it on your screen while
    viewing NK-info4.  Haha it will blend in perfectly and NuKE will
    never know.  NOTE: Following this suggestion will prove that you do
    need help.
38. Stick a virus in their IJ's and spread them around.  Like IJ #5 NuKE
    will claim it is not infected and what goes resident is the crack when
    really it is infected.  With the latest version of NuKE Pox of course.
39. Create an ascii loader stating that NuKE is lame and spread it
    everywhere.  While your at it put an add for your bbs in there.
40. Tell your daddy.
41. Tell the rest of your family.  If your italian the bloody mafia will
    eventually be after him.
42. Look up the word LAME in the dictionary.  What does it exacly mean.
43. Have fun with the word LAME.  Look if you rearrange the letters you
    can spell MALE.  Nowhere Man's mum is that.  Or how about MEAL.
    Rock Steady could use one to shut his mouth.
44. Go download a ware.  Hey Prince of Persia 19 is out.  Get it and
    spread it to all your favorite warez boards.
46. Write a text file like this.
47. Hope your still crying.
48. Shoot that damn energizer buny.
49. Jump to the top of the list and do everything over again.
50. If you havn't done anything by now.  Then you are truly lame.
