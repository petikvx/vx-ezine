1.Back Orifice Clones - The Alternative Way
=========================================
by VENOMOUS
octobre 1998
[The Alliances Group]

Clones are essential tools for channel takeovers on IRC. As IRC bots gets 

Making clones on the same server are quite hard these days. One of the popular 
ways of making clones are using wingates or socks. Scanning for an available 
socks or wingates can be frustrating. When you find one, someone might be 
using it. There another way to do it. Use Back Orifice. 

First you have to get some tools. I would suggest getting the Back Orifice 
pack and WakoFloodBots. (Don't ask me how to get them)

Now the steps.
==============

Sweep for a list of BO infected or join #bo_owned.

Open another BOGUI side by side of the first one to redirect the infected IPs.

Insert the infected IP (e.g. 192.168.0.3) into the target host text box and 
using the redir function in BOGUI, redirect the connection to the IRC server 
and port  you want. You need to have the IP not the hostname. 
To do that just type /dns irc.webbernet.net 

Put 6666 (or anything you desire) in the in port text box on BOGUI and the 
IP of the IRC server and port number in the out IP:(port) text box and hit OK. 

Now with WakoFloodBots set the server port to 6666 and the server to the IP 
of the target host you've just redirected and click connect. Once connected, 
your clone is ready.
 
To make more just repeat the steps with different IPs. 

You may of course use other clones loaders.

I know this is very troublesome so you will have to wait for a tool which 
automates all that. But you have quite stable clones and they r0xx 'cause 
bots that scan for socks cannot detect them and anyone who u

ses wingates will know that they can't 
connect to irc.webbernet.net.

2.An Introduction to IRC Colliding
==================================
by B|uSmurf
[The Alliances Group]

Alright kiddies, ever wonder what the hell happened when out of the blue 
you received this error on your status and have been disconnected from your 
IRC ?

"*** You were killed by irc.ncal.verio.net (irc.ncal.verio.net!irc.ncal.
verio.net ((ident@myisp.com)irc.anet.com <- (lamor@hisisp.com)
*.webbernet.net[root@ircd.webbernet.net]))"

This is probably due to a netsplit which occur just minutes/hours ago, 
or even a lag on a certain server. In one network there can only be on 
original nick and should there be two nicks of the same spelling both will 
be killed immediately. This is known as a nick collision.

This text is especially for kiddies who seek the knowledge of colliding, 
but unfortunately the concept is written for IRCNET but can be implement 
on other network also.

Colliding
=========

You can observe the network by joining a channel known as &servers, in 
there you'll be able to monitor all the servers at once :

•¯¯¯¯¯¯¯[ &servers  ]
 [ modes..+mtnaq o..0 v..0 total..1
 [ topic..SERVER MESSAGES: servers joining and leaving
•_______[ chanstats ]
 
Should a server split off from the rest of the network, you'll see 
something like this :

-irc.webbernet.net:&SERVERS- *** Notice -- Received SQUIT *.unipi.it from 
*.DE (Connection timed out)
-irc.webbernet.net:&SERVERS- *** Notice -- Received SERVER *.hu from 
Uni-Stuttgart.DE (7 [irc.bme.hu] Technical University of Budapest)
-irc.webbernet.net:&SERVERS- *** Notice -- Received SERVER *.unipi.it from 
irc.ludd.luth.se (8 [irc.ccii.unipi.it] University of Pisa, Italy)
-irc.webbernet.net:&SERVERS- *** Notice -- Received SQUIT irc.msu.ru from 
ircd.portal.ru (Ping timeout)

You are currently sitting on irc.webbernet.net and in the channel &servers, 
and suddenly you saw this lines like this :

"-irc.webbernet.net:&SERVERS- *** Notice -- Received SQUIT *.unipi.it from 
*.DE (Connection timed out)"
----- This mean *.unipi.it have splitted off from the rest of the network.

"-irc.webbernet.net:&SERVERS- *** Notice -- Received SERVER *.unipi.it from 
irc.ludd.luth.se (8 [irc.ccii.unipi.it] University of Pisa, Italy)"
----- This mean *.unipi.it have merge back with the network.

Another nice command nice command to get the list of the rest of the 
servers is by typing /links on your status window. Or if you want an 
easier way, get the Link Looker add-on for mIRC from Xcalibre.com or any 
other mIRC related sites.

Ok so now you know when a server splitted off or merging back, but how do 
you exploit it? The best way is to join that particular server which 
splitted by using proxies/wingates. In IRCNET we have different country 
servers and to name a few there are :

*.dti.ne.jp (6) [irc.dti.ne.jp] Akasaka Tokyo, Japan
*.lv (2) [ircd.lvnet.lv] LvNet-Teleport, Riga, Latvia
*.fr (5) [sil.polytechnique.fr] Ecole Polytechnique, France
*.at (4) [irc.wu-wien.ac.at] [137.208.127.3 6667] Vienna, A

If you're from *.ru, how do you enter a server from *.jp? Simple, book a 
plane ticket to Japan and pray hard the split doesn't merge during your 
journey. Ok, here's the way.. scan for proxy/wingate by using a scanner 
like Domscan or WGateScan which can be obtain from warforge.com.
Using this proggies, scan for *.jp proxy/wingate... and after you've found 
one open another mIRC and join in the fun. Many of you might not know how 
to use proxy/wingate, so to save you some precious times searching high 
and low for an instruction manual, below is a short commands :

/server (proxy/wingate) 23
/quote (server which have splitted off) (port)
/quote nick (nickname)
/quote user X X X X

And presto! You are in! Collide any nicks you like or regain any channels 
you want which have been opless before the split. BUT wait, there's another 
problem, you might encounter something like nick/channel temporary not 
available or channel is jupe. This can be overcome when the server have 
been splitted for quite sometimes like maybe 30 minutes or 1 hour. 

Another good way to collide is using the lag of the server which have 
recently merge back. You can collide multiple nicks by just using one 
clone, by changing your nick constantly to your victim's nicks. A good 
mIRC script which have a built in lag collide proggy is Mindfield which 
can be obtain from Tribe's homepage at : 

www.tribe.roxx.ircnet.mcmails.com

Tribe and Mindfield mIRC Scripts have built in proxy scanner in them which 
saves you your time from going around looking for proxies/wingates.

That's all kiddies, enjoy and have fun.

3.Getting the real host address in IRC
======================================
by br0therX@gmx.net
october 1998


You are again and again the victim of a Denial of Service (DoS)attack in IRC.
You are probably interested in who this attacker is,
So you do a /whois on the nick who is attacking you.
 
  /whois attacker  ----------------------------> attacker@hereisthehost.com
		  (that shows the users address)


Now you have the hostmask but already do no know if it is a spoofed one.
Next thing you have to do is a /dns on the attacker's hostmask.

  /dns hereisthehost.com ------------------------> couldn't be resolved
			(usually gives you the IP)


The IP couldn't be resolved so it's probably a spoofed on


But what can we do ? Hey no problem! There is a real nice command for IRC 
(doesn't work on IRC-net Server).

  /quote userip attacker ---------------> attacker=specialagent@195.111.112.123

Wow - and the last thing you have to do now is:

  /dns 195.111.112.123 -----------------> Resolved to luba-pc.de


Gotscha! You have the real host address. Time to let the attacker dance.

4. 13 tiny bytes to show the huge sillyness of our great common
===============================================================
bt398 (bt398#@SOTON.AC.UK)

Lately, I've been playing a bit with net.exe program(\windows\net.exe). With 
this program, a user can set up the networkdrivers (Windows For Workgroup 
protocol); moreover, a user can log in (opena wfw session) and also change 
his password. As this program runs on DOS, I've been wondering how next.exe 
was retrieving the password of the user;as no DLL calls to undocumented 
functions are possible, only a call to aspecial interrupt/function should be 
used. Then, tracing through the code, I've found a rather interesting feature.
When a user changes its password, net.exe accesses to the old passwordusing 
the multiplex interrupt 2fh (or so-called software interrupt) withfunction 
11h (sub function 84h). I suppose that function 11XX, int 2fh is installed 
by the windows kernel so that it can exchange data (WFW infos)with a DOS 
program. Well, so you would say that this function requires asinput the 
password and returns an error if the password is bad.. but,  no...Microsoft 
did it the other way. The function returns the uncrypted password to a 
buffer (... no comment).Indeed, this is not _big_ deal but if a user has 
access to your computerafter you logged then he can easily retrieve your 
password.. And I am sure that a lot of people uses the same password for 
their mail and their windows password (so it is somewhat a security problem). 
I attached a smallprogram that prompts the password of the user (you must 
have logged in first); this only work on Windows for Workgroup 3.11 and 
Windows 95(Windows 98 and Windows NT are not affected -hopefully-).But I 
wouldn't be surprised if Win98 has an undocumented function that returns the 
password of the user (I wouldn't bet that about NT though.)
fix : well, I didn't find anything .. except that this code : 
mov ax, 1184h 
mov bx, 0dh 
xor cx, cx 
int 2fh
seems to disable the password caching feature.

5.Basic TCP/IP Components
=========================
by br0therX@gmx.net
octobre 1998
credits to J.P.


Before moving forward to discussions of deeper knowledge, it is important 
that you have the base understanding of some of the more common TCP/IP 
concepts.


The IP Address
==============


Every computer connected to the Internet or another network need a unique 
TCP/IP Address. A single TCP/IP Address is comprised of two components that 
combine to provide a single resolvable address: the Network Identification 
and the Host Identification.


Network and Host Identification and the InterNIC
================================================


 
The Network Identification portion of a TCP/IP address identifies what 
portion of your network a device resides on, while the Host address portion 
of the address identifies a device as unique. Because there are varying 
sizes of networks, and a limited number of IP addresses, TCP/IP address 
schemes have been categorized into three address classes. These three 
classes are administered by an organization called InterNIC. The InterNIC 
maintains a list of available IP address schemes and assigns them to 
organizations in an effort to ensure that no two networks have the same 
network ID. This done to prevent conflicts if a network decides to become 
part of the Internet. To effectively distribute these IP addresses, the 
InterNIC has defined three address classes based on the number of octets 
that are used to make up a Network ID. These address classes are known as 
Class A, B, and C.


Which Classes and Host Numbers Available ?
==========================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IP Address          Octets used for Octets used for              Octet A    Available
Class                Network ID           Host ID                Values    Host Add.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class A                 A                  B,C,D                 1-126      16.777.214
Class B                 A,B                C,D                   128-191        65.534
Class C                 A,B,C              D                     192-233           254
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

An IP address is made up of four octets, represented as A,B,C,D in the 
previous table. In all cases a single IP address is made up of a Host ID 
and a Network ID. For instance,  if a machine had the Class C address of 
199.23.232.17, the machine would have a Network ID of 199.23.232 and a Host 
ID of 17. On the other hand, of a machine had a Class B address of 
142.55.39.121 it would have a Network ID of 142.55 and a Host ID of 39.121


What is a Subnet Mask ?
=======================


Even though your TCP/IP stack is inherently aware of the three TCP/IP 
classifications and therefore will automatically break down the Host ID and 
Network ID of any given address, it is necessary to assign each logical 
network a Subnet Mask. This Subnet Mask assists each client in determining 
the Host and Network IDs of any packets coming in and any packets going out. 
A Subnet Mask assigns 1s to the Network ID bits and 0s to the Host ID bits 
of an IP address providing for quick translation of an IP address.


Default Subnet Mask for Each Address Class
==========================================


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IP Address       Network ID       Subnet Mask   Binary Translation
Class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class A  A.X.X.X          255.0.0.0      11111111.00000000.00000000.0000000
Class B  A.B.X.X          255.255.0.0    11111111.11111111.00000000.0000000
Class C  A.B.C.X          255.255.255.0  11111111.11111111.11111111.0000000

While it might seen redundant to assign a Subnet Mask to a computer when the 
TCP/IP stack is inherently aware of the network classifications, it can 
actually be used to further segment the network.
Subnet Masks can be an extremely complicated subject. 


The Default Gateway
===================


The Default Gateway often simply called the Router, is a device that has 
knowledge of other Gateways on the network and is used as first contact 
by devices that need to communicate outside their own network.
In other words, any time a host sends a packet to a device with a different 
Network ID, the packet is first sent to the Default Gateway. The Default 
Gateway then forwards the packet to the next logical gateway until the 
packet reaches the final gateway. The Default Gateway is in most cases 
associated with either a physical router port or a logical router port.


The Domain Name Servers - DNS
=============================
The Domain Server provides a user friendly interface to your TCP/IP network 
by providing a method for resolving IP Addresses to easy-to-remember Host 
Names. The Domain Name Server is used to eliminate the need for every user 
to know not only your network addressing scheme, but also the Host ID of 
every sever or host. The first step in alleviating the situation is to 
provide a Domain Name to act as an alias for the Network ID. For instance, 
using a Domain Name Server 131.135.132.100 can be translated to DRESSMAN.COM



WINS/NetBIOS Name
=================


Microsoft clients (as do OS/2) require the NetBIOS interface client to 
server/client to client communication.
The TCP/IP protocol does not inherently provide for this interface.
In result, when a Net-BIOS-dependent machine attempts to communicate across 
a subnet with another NetBIOS-dependent machine using only IP, it will fail 
miserably. Even though Machine A can ping Machine B and vice versa, unless 
the NetBIOS interface is available, there will be no communication.
To resolve this issue, the Internet community at large defined RFCs 1001/1002 
(Request for Comment) providing design for an IP-friendly NetBIOS-Interface. 
This interface, commonly known as a NetBIOS Name Server, acts very much like 
a standard Domain Server; however, instead of providing a flat Host Name to 
IP address resolution, it provides NetBIOS name to IP address resolution 
allowing for standard NetBIOS-dependent communication.

At this time, there are only three known NetBIOS Name Servers. The first is 
Microsoft WINS, which provides complete NetBIOS-dependent services for all 
Windows clients - but is not completely RFC-compliant. 
The second is SAMBA, a shareware based UNIX service that not only acts as a 
NetBIOS Name Server, but also allows UNIX hosts to act like Windows for 
Workgroups workstations and share files with Microsoft clients.
The last known NetBIOS Name server is provided by Network TeleSystems.

Note: So be aware if your Computer tries to communicate via port 137 to the 
Internet telling anyone that you are sharing printers and files.

7.Cracking WebPages for the whole family-or-Webmaster change your Permissions!
==============================================================================
by br0therX
octobre 1998


This should not be a how to crack but should show how easy it is to obtain 
miss-configured Frontpage passwords!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| There is an often quoted axiom in computing publishing circles and it goes |
| like this "80 percent of the people use only 20 percent of a program's     |
| capabilities" |                                                            |

FrontPage VTI-BIN and VTI_PVT Vulnerabilities
=============================================

FrontPage Version: 1.0
Impact: Remote users can view passwords or other sensitive files
Class: Severe to critical
Fix: None yet.
Additional Info: http://rhino9.ml.org ; bugtraq@netspace.org ; 
http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/search.html


This is a well known bug in the security world but it still exists !
And so I think that it is worth to discuss.

You can find those Frontpage servers via SearchEngines like Altavista 
[http://www.altavista.com] or with FTP-SearchEngines like FTPSearch 
[http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/].


Just look for files like :      administrator.pwd 
				administrators.pwd
				authors.pwd     
				service.pwd     
				users.pwd 
						


If you found such a file try to access it. Probably you have no problem to 
read it. There are no world-read restrictions. And by default this directory 
is also world writeable!! That's really a huge security hole!
[maybe you want use the Anonymizer [http://www.anonymizer.com/surf_free.shtml] 
for accessing such files, or even use another way of Proxy-Chaining.

Those *.pwd files are stored in the /vti_pvt/ directory.
A typical /vti_pvt/ directory looks like this:

  users.pwd              19-May-97 19:06     1K




 Your *.pwd file which you accessed via http or ftp will look apparently like:
 
# -FrontPage- 
br0therX:RIeUwTw2eYj56   ------>note: that's not the password, but the
-                                     encrypted hash.


WOW - that's it! Now you have the FrontPage login and also the encrypted  
password. Add  :0:0:comments:/:/bin/bash to your password file and drop it 
into your cracker [br0therX:RIeUwTw2eYj56:0:0:comments:/:/bin/bash] like:

Cracker Jack by Jackal; PaceCrack95; Hades by Remote and Zabkar 
(pooh...that's fast) or John the Ripper by Solar Designer.

FrontPage server extension use DES encryption.
"One would think that DES is entirely infallible. It isn't. Although the 
information cannot be reverse encoded, passwords encrypted via DES can be 
revealed through a comparative process. The process works as(s) follows:


1. You obtain a dictionary file, which is really no more than a flat file 
   (plain text) list of words [commonly referred to as wordlists].
2. These words are encrypted using DES
3. Each encrypted word is compared to the target password. If a match occurs, 
   there is a  98 percent chance that the password was cracked."


Wow, again -that's it! Now you have the password in plaintext!
A lot of people also use this password for their UNIX-Shell. So you can take 
a homerun directly to ROOT.

Shit this was damn easy and all I can say is: Check your Frontpage *.pwd 
file permissions and the permission to view /_vti_pvt/ and /_vti_bin/ .
Or maybe some day you will found your side cracked.



The next problem is that anyone could connect to the /_vti_bin/ directory, 
place commands files and execute them.

8.BackOrifice Remove/Detect
===========================
by the RobinsonLaw
kelvinla@yahoo.com
September 27, 1998


Since that more and more newbies became the victim of Bo 
(a popular trojans).I'll write an article on how
to detect whrether user is been infected by trojan and how 
to remove them.


Back Orifice(BO) Desription
===========================


REMEMBER-Never receive a file from a stranger even if 
they said they have a good hacker program unless u doing!!!

Many newbie have been affected because they have initialise
a server trojan file,which in real name for it is BOSERVE.exe.
It can be renamed by the intruder.Once it is installed ,
it'll open up a backdoor for intruder to get in through
the victim ip address and create hoax in it.
For instance,delete victim files,copy it,reboot victim machine etc.

Some infected victim thaught that the intruder is a real
hacker but actually even a 9 yrs old boy can do that just 
by clicking the program.The create of this program is 
show that how insecure win95/98 is.

To determining whrether BO has been installed on your machine:

Basic level
===========

Basic level mean that the trojan install in victim machine is no 
password needed and it's using default port which came by 
downloading the back orifice program.In this case i will only
taught how to detect and remove it i won't taught u how to 
use it cuz more and more ppl been the victim of it 
and i don't want them to surfur again.If you don't agree 
what i said just ignore it and continue ur LAMN ACTIVIES.

1]go to c:\windows\system directory and check whrether there is a
 blank program ( .exe)<-- spacebar.exe if u found it u 
 couldn't delete it now cuz it's running when ever u startup 
 ur machine.

SOLUTION-There is plenty of way to remove it so i only teach one.
That is don't startup ur windows go to dos prompt when u startup ur
machine goto the c:\windows\system and delete the program.

2]Well after u successful delete it,it does not mean that u free from
trojan u still have to delete the registry key if not windows will 
startup with an annoying saying that this file counldn't execute.

Solution-Start the regedit program (c:\windows\regedit.exe)and access 
the key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
Look for files that range between 124,928 byte and remove it.
In default situation,the data will be set value as " .exe" when u 
see it just click delete.

3]If someone tell you that he going to delete your 
favourite program or ur screen pop up a message such as 
"YOU ARE NOW BEEN HACKED" u will probably think that some 
hacker had hack into ur machine and u couldn't do much about
 unless became nervous and seek for help right?


 Solution-1]Disconnect from the net and he will not get
 into ur machine anymore follow instruction above and 
 remove the trojan.Simple and easy

 Solution-2]In case you want some fun and see who is 
 accesing ur hardisk  .First run c:\windows\netstat.exe
 and you will see some ip address look  for Uddp 
 port 31337 or 90 that mean the intruder is connect to u.
 You can copy his ip address and do wateva u want :>.


Advanced Level
==============


Advanced level mean the trojan had been reconfigured.
When u follow instruction above and still could not cure 
it then it maybe the intruder have renamed it or change the port.

1]In case i don't want to waste your time on how to remove it
 just go to our club and download an antigen for it.

2)Well if the situation could not be cure just backup ur 
important files and reformat your hardisk :>.

9.ICQ-EXPLOIT
==============
by the ÉÅZ¥ MÖÑÉ¥
eazy_money@hcvorg.com
October 17, 1998


Annoying People and Shortcuts
=============================

ICQ won't let you on?  Well try instead of just connecting, go into chat
mode but, when you connect you'll be in chat.  Just click 
Available/Connect and it'll disappear.  You're on.If you're in a large
chat room or just have "IRC Style", if someone has the same text color
as your background you can't see it right?  Go to Display then click 
Override Format.Ok I'm sure some of you live with your parents 
(not 18 yet) or maybe you have a sibling or friend who like to watch
you when you're in ICQ right?  Yeah me too.  Well say you're in a chat 
with someone teaching you something or you're there with some girl/guy
(no discrimination here) getting off.  You don't want them to read it
but you want to save it right?  Well click File and then  Save Buffer.
But then you need to get rid of it well, click File and then 
Clear Buffer.You're in a chat and noone knows each other right? 
Well there's this one person leaving logs all over in your firewall
(it happens).  This guy/girl isn't on your ICQ list but he/she's 
cussing you out in chat.  So he can't get past your firewall but 
you wanna talk to these people well, KICK HIM/HER.  Click File then
Kick User then double-click the nick of this person.  It brings up 
a voting dialog. If the person doesn't get kicked they're liable to
do the same to you.Someone wants you to teach them to hack?  They keep
trying to send you a chat too?  Well of course you're going to decline
but you want to slow him down some?  Well Decline with a reason. 
Put your reason.  Then hold enter until the dialog holds no more.
Then click ok.  The person sees a reason and they can't click ok because
it's too big for the window.  They can click on the dialog and hit enter
or space and it'll disappear but are they thinking about it?
In the old ICQ when you double-clicked the persons name and the message
dialog popped up right?  Well in ICQ 98 you can double-click their name
and it opens up the message box.You hate when someone sends a message
to anyone?  You want to do it but you're not sure how?  Well open up 
a message box to anyone then click More then Multiple Recipients then 
send it to whoever you want.You wanna send more than one file on ICQ? 
Well go to the directory where the files are then click the first file
then hold CTRL click all the other files you want then send it.
You wanna get someone to leave you alone?  Get them to add themselves
to their own cantact list.  When they connect to ICQ next time.  
Everyone on their list will be gone when they restart ICQ.

Proof ICQ has a few mistakes
============================

When you send a Inernet Phone/Game Do not Accept is spelled wrong.
Click on the ICQ button then move your mouse to the right over the
 flower then let go the button sticks.After you get over 200 users on 
your list you'll start losing some you don't talk to.
When you use a ' in your Information or in a message it comes out as ".

Supposed Secrets
================

Put a - next to your name then look at your info.  You don't see what 
it do you?  It's right there! 'Nick Name First Name and Last Name' ARE
 NOW  'Category Company and Department'Put a & next to your name and 
like the tip above....it changes your info.  Check it.INs like 7000000 
(Administrator Ð) work for ICQ also try 8000000 and so on.  I have not
 tried all these.

Security
========
Say you've been message bombed on ICQ?  Me too.  Well, you can stop
that.Click ICQ then go into Security & Privacy then go to the ignore 
list tab.Then click Do not accept messages from users not on my list.
That's it.  Mess with the Security & Privacy.

Spoofing
========

Yes I know this is why you got this document in the first place.So here
it is.Well, click ICQ then go to Preferences then click on the Connection
tab.  Click I'm using a permanent internet connection (LAN).  Then click
I am behind a firewall or proxy.  Now click Firewall settings.  I am
using a SOCKS4 proxy server.  Next.  Now put in the IP you want in 
SOCKS4 Host.  Click next.  Click Done.  Click OK.  Now restart ICQ 
and you're spoofed.

You wanna know the drawbacks to this?  Well here they are.
First off you can't get a direct connection to anyone.  
It'll ask you to send through the server.  Noone else can get a 
direct connection to you.  If they keep hitting Retry they'll never 
get through so they have to be smart enough to send through the server.
Also you can't send or recieve chat requests.  That's about it.

Heya !

So I'm finally back ;) Since i've in the last couple of weeks have noticed
people keep asking about a serial for Winamp i decided to write this tutorial.
I know there are several keygens out there, but wouldn't it be nicer to get
the serial on your own ? Sure it would, and that's why, in this tutorial, i'm
gonna teach you how to "crack" Winamp 2.0

So read on and have your very own serial within a minute ;)

First of all you need to install the program (Winamp 2.0 - www.winamp.com)
Then i suppose you have already installed SoftIce and are now ready to crack.

So you probably already noticed (using SoftIce), that WinAmp 2.0 
(WA2 from now on), uses the breakpoint getdlgitemtexta (=BPX GETDLGITEMTEXTA)
So you launch WA2 and go to the Registration menu. Now you're ready to type
your name and (fake) serial. So you type your name, except for the last 
letter cause WA2 checks for the correct serial by every single letter
you type.EX: BuLLe  (without the last letter).
Then you press CTRL+D and type BPX GETDLGITEMTEXTA
Press F5 and type in the last letter. (in my case T)
*BOOM* and you're back in SoftIce.
There you press F11 to return from the CALL'er.
Then you press F10 10 times untill you're at this line:
0177:0040373B   CMP EAX,ESI
Hmm..two registers compared..sounds interesting, so let's type ? EAX to get
a closer look at it. In my case this is what showed up:
024F541D        0038753309      "OT"
Now what, you think. Well if you don't see anything interesting here you 
might as well reboot your system and never turn the power back on ;) 
Guess what you're looking at DUMBASS !! Yeah you're damn right ! 
The serial !!!!So clear all breakpoints by typing BC* and return to WA2.
Enter your name and serial and guess what shows up in the About box !!

		----- LICENSED TO: <your name> (your serial) -----

Is this cool or what ?? Yes it is. Eventhough you could have d/l'ed a keygen,
you must feel better doing it your self. At least I do ;)

All for now..till next time !

to get the fun stuff with winamp
-> open winamp
press N
press U
press L
press escape
press L
press escape
press S
press O
press F
press T

I write thi$ for educational u$e only!!
If  you get bu$ted it i$ not my falt it i$ your$.
$oo you can not take me to trail or $ue me
here we go you phone addict$  :-)

This will show you how to make a red box
it i$ ea$y a$ 1,2,3 

$tep 1..     what you will need
========

you will need a "33 Number Memory Pocket Tone Dialer"you can pick one
up at raido shack and you will need to order a "6.5536 MHz frequency
crystal" from mouser you can pick one up at http://www.mouser.com
last but not least you will have to have a phillip's head screw driver

$tep 2..    
========

Once you get every thang take cover off and remove the crystal
that is in there and saulder the 6.5536 MHz frequency crystal in there.
Then program the 33 Number Memory Pocket Tone Dialer
to play the nickel,dime,and quarter tones.

$tep 3..
========

Now you go to a payphone and play the tones and never agin pay for a service.

Do not edit thi$ in any way!!!
Leave it a$ it i$ or you will be sent to Hackers Hell=)

Thi$ trick work$ be$t with ICQ and IRC

I write thi$ for educational u$e only!!
If  you get bu$ted it i$ not my falt it i$ your$.
$oo you can not and will not take me to trail,$ue,and or blame me in any 
way for your action$. Here we go you hacking addict$  :-)


Here we go,

1st off get the victims ip# off  ICQ or on IRC they could be spoofed
type this to get a the real ip# on IRC /quote userip eazymoney.Which
gives:eazymoney=+user@194.134.10.162. This is his true ip  #4. Now once
again you /dns 194.134.10.162. This time, there is a response Resolved
to <the dns user resolved>"source from Antionline"

If he/she has you on there ignore list on ICQ then make another account
and readd that uin# or Try to find some one there talking to that is
on the victims list and is on your list too either way you'll get their 
ip#.

What you got to do now is open a exploit (nestea or boink, newtear etc 
for Linux) (the best to use is Exploit Generator v0.85 for Windows) run
a netstat "dns their ip#" get the port open from that host.
You should now have the victims ip# and port , then send a packet just 
1 from a regognized host they talk to seldomly "note" 79% firewall users
have such fucked up rulsets or so many incoming hosts that they let 1 
packet through. that packet is let through on their ruleset, so it 
registers =) ding! 

It may take a while for the packet to send the whole fragment but
within a matter of seconds.
Boom watch the lamer go offline. :-)
There are other ways of forcing backdoors open on conseal PC
firewall "considering it has 2 flaws" As to be said by many firewall
annaylists "conseal pc firewall" is the most secure firewall to prevent
attacks against hackers. Well you annalzers check twice next time:) 

Thi$ ha$ been te$ted by me it work$ on a lot of pepole.
I would like to $ay about not quite 99% considering you have some
firewall warrior out amongst us.
Thi$ i$ good to prove to pepole that thank there really secure  
that thay ain't $hit basicly.
Even lamer$ can prove them worng.

14.Connecting to SprintNet/...etc from Canada
=============================================
 by KungFu Monkey
 shitall@yahoo.com
 October 12, 1998


Alright incase you hadn't noticed there is nothing written by me. Well
nothing with my name on it, RIGHT? Its cause my name use to be Varicose Virus
and that got old really fast, so I decided to right a text on connecting to

SprintNet/Telnet/SprintMail/GlobeNet from Canada. As you may know SprintNet
is almost impossible to connect via Canada. You cant call SprintNet up with
your modem cause it doesn't work like that, well if your in the states it
does work like that, but your out of the calling area, but when you try
through datapac you get error messages like this: CALL CLEARED- INCOMPATIBLE 
CALL OPTIONS (XXY).

So how the hell does someone connect to the elusive SprintNet from North of
the border??

So far there is only one way to connect to this over protective American
network from Canada. It takes a little skill and knowledge but after
that your in.


Connecting to SprintNet/Telnet:
===============================

First you'll need a telnet account with a BBS or your ISP or something. you
then need to find a dialout. I tend to use dialout.XXXX.edu (XXXX is
actually letters but I ain't tellin yall cause overuse causes many a shutdown,
RIGHT?)

Once connected to the dialout you need to make sure its working so type AT

it should reply with OK
if not your fuct.

Then your gonna find a SprintNet public access dialup. [I use 18005463000] if
this number is still available while you read this go ahead and use it.

So you've telneted to your dialout. You've typed AT and received OK, so
next is dialing the number you want to dial. the system I use is ATDT8[then #]
(it could be different with the system you use) so then you type
ATDT818005463000
....you wait...and you wait...and wait some more...but then you receive

CONNECT 1200

BUFFER 38400

So now what?? well do what any good hacker would do. Hit <return> or ENTER
twice. If the dialout disconnects you, keep trying, the dialout I use only
connects everyonce and a while. So you hit ENTER twice you then see

TERMINAL=

Now I've tried D2 and <RETURN> and they do the same thing so go for it.
So now your connected to SprintNet, felicitations. So what now? Its just like
datapac'cept you don't have to enter the zeros so example 31200061 can be
re-written as 31261 don't ask...it just does.

That's about it. Also this is VERY fun to play on. And now you can go
to IRC and show how your are an 31337 HAX0R DUDE! and you can say, HEY I CAN
GET TO SPRINTNET BUT CAN YOU GET TO DATAPAC?? although they probably can so
don't ask.


Conclusion:
===========

Be very CAREFULL when using dialout on the internet, cause they can very
easily trace your number (of course they can they're a freakin'
Telecom Company) and its SIMPLE as hell to trace telnet sessions! Unless
your an EREET BITCH but if your such an EREET BITCH why are you reading
this?!?

Tracing
=======

This is really easy but some people dont know this .. 
Get WSPING and get the ip and trce it ..  the 2nd to last domain is normaly 
the isp.. that sahould tell you and if it doesn't try the domain like as if 
it where a webpage .. (Ex.--)
IP Address: 209.30.70.6

16.Rootshell Defaced
=====================
taken from http://www.rootshell.com
28 octobre 1998


10/28/98 8:44AM PDT
On Wed Oct 28th at 5:12AM PST the main Rootshell page was defaced by a group 
of crackers. Entry to the machine was made via SSH (secure shell) which is 
an encrypted interface to the machine at 04:57AM PST this morning. Rootshell 
was first informed of this incident at 6:00 AM PST and the site was 
immediately brought offline. The site was back up and operational by 
8:00AM PST. We are still in the process of investigating the exact methods 
that were used. The paranoid MAY want to disable ssh 1.2.26. Rootshell runs 
Linux 2.0.35, ssh 1.2.26, qmail 1.03, Apache 1.3.3 and nothing else. The 
attackers used further filesystem corruption to make it harder to remove the 
damaged HTML files.


Here is the hacked site:
