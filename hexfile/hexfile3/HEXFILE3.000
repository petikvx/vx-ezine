          Iniibig ko ang Pilipinas
 
          Ito ang aking lupang sinilangan
 
          Ito ang tahanan ng aking lahi
 
          Ako'y kanyang kinukupkop at tinutulungan
 
          Upang maging malakas, maligaya at kapaki-pakinabang
 
          Bilang ganti
 
          Diringgin ko ang payo ng aking mga magulang
 
          Susundin ko ang mga tuntunin ng aking paaralan
 
          Tutuparain ko ang mga tungkulin ng isang mamamayang
            makabayan at masunurin sa batas
 
          Paglilingkuran ko ang aking bayan ng walang pag-iimbot 
            at buong katapatan
 
          Sisikapin kong maging isang tunay na Pilipino
 
                  sa ISIP
 
                    sa SALITA
 
                      at sa GAWA
 
 
 
    Mabuhay!
 
 
    It is centennial month. What more can I say but...

    On the Matthew article last issue, I brought forward the idea that 
    Matthew could have been written by someone from Adamson University. I 
    also stated that Mathhew.2667 might shed light on the real origin of 
    the virus. It turned out that I was wrong on the Adamson part and 
    right on the 2667 variant. However, I still believe that Matthew is 
    partly based on Possessed.
 
    YeZ sent me a disassembly and a copy of Matthew.2667 virus. Based on 
    the disassembly, the virus might have been written by someone named 
    "R.M.O. Ordona" (or do we have another "Hermilito Go" here?) of Saint 
    Louis University in Baguio City. The place where the virus originated 
    is indicated in the last line of the virus message: 
 
                 Matthew 6:25 (Agnes) May 92' IICS-SLU B.C.
 
    Where "IICS-SLU" refers to the Institute of Information and Computing 
    Sciences-Saint Louis University (now known as College of Information 
    and Computing Sciences). "B.C." stands for Baguio City.  
    
    This firmly proves that Matthew is from the Philippines. Thanks to 
    YeZ for bringing this to my attention. More on the virus when we 
    feature YeZ's disassembly in a future issue.
 
    You can visit the web page of St. Louis University at 
 
                            http://www.slu.edu.ph
 
 
                                     <o>
 
 
    What do we have for this issue? First, we are going to have the works 
    of friends:
 
 
    * YeZ *  YeZ is a college student in Zamboanga City. He will share 
           with us his thoughts on stealthing, specifically, hiding an 
           infection when a program is loaded in a debugger. To further 
           illustrate his thoughts, a demo virus, *YeZ.1155*, is 
           included.  
 
           Zamboanga City is the only place left in the Philippines where 
           Spanish is still spoken. It's not really pure Spanish, but 
           Spanish speaking people would understand it. I don't know if 
           YeZ speaks Chabacano. 
 
 
    * Mikee *  Mikee is from Novaliches, Quezon City. He is the prime 
           mover of Mikee's World which you would find at 
 
                     http://members.xoom.com/virmike/
 
           The web site recently had a long-needed facelift and is much 
           improved now. Mikee's venture to EXE infection with a version 
           of the *StowAway* virus. 
 
           Mikee's World will soon release their zine. Watch out for it.
 
 
                                     <o>
 
 
    Then our usual disassembly of viruses found in the wild but this time 
    we are going to feature virus families that are flag wavers in 
    commemoration of the Centennial of the Declaration of Independence of 
    the Philippines.
 
 
    * June12 *  This nationalistic virus plays the Philippine national 
          anthem, "Lupang Hinirang", in full and displays the national 
          flag. Three strains of the virus that I have copies of, is in 
          this issue.
 
    * Rebolusyon *  Another flag-waving virus but is sympathetic to the
          Communist Party of the Philippines.
 
 
    These next viruses from the wild are not flag wavers but boot 
    infectors. 
 
    * Quaint.B *  This is the other known variant of Quaint. Quaint.A 
          appeared on HEX-FILES No. 2. The Quaint dropper was updated to
          include Quaint.B. 
 
    * Sampo *  Sampo is the first confirmed boot virus to have originated 
          from the Philippines that is able to infect hard disks. Virus
          dropper program and disassembly by YeZ. 
 
 
                                     <o>
 
 
    And finally, viruses that came from my wildest dreams:
 
    * Kontragapi *  A polymorphic COM infector which places the jump to 
          the virus code several instructions away from the program 
          entry point. It also has retrovirus functions.
 
 
    * Duwende 2 *  The encrypted and stealth version of Duwende. For 
          those who do not know it yet, the original Duwende appeared 
          on HEX-Files No. 1.
 
 
    * June12.Sentenaryo.1898 * This is my virus to mark the centennary of 
          the Declaration of Independence of the Philippines. This is 
          actually a modification of June12.Standard.2660 -- the most 
          nationalistic virus ever to come out of this 100-year old 
          republic.

                                   to the 
                             
                             people of Indonesia 
 
                                  for your 
                           successful mass actions 
                          to effect changes in your 
                             national leadership
