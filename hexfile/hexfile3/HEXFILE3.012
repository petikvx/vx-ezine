    Virus Name:   Kontragapi
    Author:       Putoksa Kawayan
    Origin:       Manila, Philippines
    Date Written: April 1998
 
 
    Kontragapi is a polymorphic, memory resident, COM infector. It places 
    the "jump to virus" away from the entry point. It generates random 
    common instructions to pad the decryption instructions. It would also 
    trash programs it consider as anti-virus. 
 
    Even with heuristic, AVs could not detect the virus at present. Even 
    if the AV could find the "jump to virus", it would get lost in the 
    padding used to hide the decryption instructions. Even AVs that 
    construct or use a generic decryptor, would find it hard to determine 
    the specific decryption instructions.
 
    These would remain true until the AVs get hold of the virus.
 
 
 
    THE VIRUS
 
    Kontragapi resides in memory as a TSR requiring 6432 bytes of memory. 
    It hooks Int 21. It also hooks Int 24 when the Int 21 handler is 
    active. It lets other infected files know that it is resident in 
    memory. If it receives a get system date request (21/2a) with DX 
    having a value of 1898h, DX is returned with a value of 1998h. There 
    is no chance that this value would be returned by the regular 
    function because it is out of range.
 
    It infects COM programs if you want to know what drive you are 
    currently on (21/0e) or you ask for the system date (21/2a). This 
    usually happens when you execute a "DIR". Even typing "A:" and 
    pressing the enter key triggers the infection routine. 
 
    Because the infection triggers are not directly associated with a 
    file, Kontragapi searches for an uninfected COM program in the 
    current directory. 
 
    How does it know if the COM is infected? Kontragapi looks at the time 
    and date stamp value for the file returned by the file search. If the 
    FileTime.Second and FileDate.Day-1 is the same, then the file is 
    considered infected. I used FileDate.Day-1 so that I could lessen the 
    chance of triggering the "invalid time stamp" flag of AVs' heuristic 
    scanners. This leaves me with files created on the 31st day of the 
    month that would trigger the heuristic flag, like MS-DOS 6.22 COMs. 
 
    Kontragapi would only infect COM programs at least 512 bytes long. 
    However, having a longer file is no guarantee that it would be 
    infected. This would depend on the location of the executable 
    instructions and what these instructions are. If a COM is infected, 
    the virus is appended to the program. The instruction that passes 
    control to the virus is usually somewhere in the middle of the host 
    program. 
 
    The virus is 2292 bytes long but the actual infective length varies. 
    This is because the length of the decryptor varies between 100 and 
    1000 bytes. I reserved a 1536-byte buffer for the creation of the 
    decryptor to be safe.
 
 
 
    RETROVIRUS (ANTI-AV) FUNCTIONS
 
    Kontragapi would check name of files against those normally used by 
    AVs, that is, when you execute them (21/4b); when you open a file 
    (21/3d); tinker with their attributes (21/43); or, rename them 
    (21/56). The filename associated with these DOS functions is 
    considered AV if it matches any of the following:
 
                  F-*  TB*  AV*  *AV  *VIR*  *SCAN*  *KILL* 
 
    If a match is found, the start of the file would be overwritten with 
    a short program that randomly displays "kontragapi".
 
    Kontragapi is not selective on file types and would even overwrite 
    text files. The file extension is included in the AV name match. 
    Infected programs renamed by AVs to *.VIR would also be overwritten.
 
    These AV search masks would take care of all the AVs referenced 
    (except for Sweep which is a later addition) in the PhVx Register. As 
    promised last issue, AVP had been included in the guest list of 
    Kontragapi. AVP is very close to my heart that I would go out of my 
    way to accomodate it.
 
 
 
    POLYMORPHISM
 
    You can consider the encryption of Kontragapi as polymorphic. 
    However, it is not a true polymorphic because the decryption 
    structure remains constant. What makes this polymorphic is the 
    insertion of random common instructions in between the decryption 
    instructions. 
 
    The structure of the decryption is as follows:
 
                mov            sp,start_virus
         _loop: pop            ax
                xchg           sp,ax
                xor/sub/add    sp,ax
                xchg           sp,ax
                push           ax
                pop            reg16 (except sp)
                cmp            sp,end_decryption
 
    The encryption loop has two format:
 
             jne  _loop             je   _end
             jmp  virus_code        jmp  _loop
                              _end: jmp  virus_code 
 
    Notice that only two registers are used in the decryption -- sp and 
    ax. This simplifies the insertion of irrelevant common instructions. 
    And, ah and sp, as well as al and ax, share the same register bit 
    value.
 
    What are the instructions inserted? All instructions inserted are 
    common and what could be more common than:
 
           mov                             reg,reg/mem/immediate
           add/adc/sub/sbb/xor/or/and/cmp  reg,reg/mem/immediate
           rol/ror/rcl/rcr/shl/shr/sar     reg,cl/1
           xchg                            ax,reg16 
 
    The register and immediate operands could either be 8-bit or 16-bit. 
    All registers are used except for sp. The memory operands are in four 
    formats: directly addressed, and, indirect with no displacement, with 
    8-bit diplacement and 16-bit displacement.
 
    The instructions generated are based on the content of the file which 
    would make the insertions "unique" to that file. There would be at 
    least one inserted instruction (1 to 5 bytes long) in-between the 
    decryption instructions. The first decryption instruction would be 
    placed away from the destination of the "jump to virus".
 
    Is this routine bug-free? I admit that I have not thoroughly debugged 
    the routine. One problem I forsee is when it comes to memory 
    operands. If we have the instruction:
 
         mov/add/adc/sub/sbb/xor/or/and/cmp    register16,[memory16]
    
    and [memory16] points to ffffh, then we would be facing hang time. It 
    had happened before and it could happen again. That's the risk we 
    have to take.
 
    This usually happens if the instruction associated with a 16-bit 
    indirect-addressed memory operand is preceded by an OR PtrReg16,xxxx. 
    Although MOV, ADD, ADC, SUB, SBB, XOR and AND could also precipitate 
    this problem, it would not be as likely as OR. Because the program 
    loops, the value of that PtrReg16 could accumulate especially if it 
    is not changed by other instructions within the loop.
 
 
 
    INSTRUCTION TRACER
     
    Kontragapi uses an instruction tracer to "tunnel" into the host 
    program. This would put the "jump to virus" several instructions away 
    from the program entry point, the first non-branching instruction, 
    that is not a jmp or call.
 
    The tracer does not care what the instructions are. However, it is 
    interested in how many bytes make up the instruction. By doing this, 
    it could skip over some instructions. In the real world, this would 
    be 3 to 6 instructions because the tracer fails when it gets to a 
    conditional jump. Still, there would be instances when this would be 
    much farther away.
 
    The instructions recognized by Kontragapi and therefore skipped are:
 
      int                             10/11/12/16/1a/some 21
      push/pop                        segreg/reg16
      inc/dec                         reg16
      add/adc/sub/sbb/xor/or/and/cmp  reg/mem, mem/reg/immediate
      mov                             reg/mem, mem/reg/immediate
      mov                             segreg, reg/mem 
      mov                             reg/mem, segreg
      lea                             reg, mem
      test                            ax/al, immediate
      rol/ror/rcl/rcr/shl/shr/sar     reg/mem, cl/1
      xchg                            ax, reg16
      cs:/ds:/es:/ss:
      pusha/popa/pushf/popf
      cbw/cwd/nop
      daa/das/aaa
      cmc/clc/cli/sti/cld/std
      direct jmp_short/jmp_near/call_near
 
 
    This would be fine if there are no risks involved. What are these?
 
     * It is possible that the virus could be changed/overwritten because 
       we are not concerned with what the skipped instructions really 
       are. Any instruction that changes the content of a memory operand 
       is a possible cause for disaster.
 
     * Because we re-execute the skipped instructions, if the host 
       program assumes the register to contains a particular value, then 
       we have a problem here. 
 
     * If the skipped instructions change the value of a segment 
       register, this might result to unfavorable condition.

    Two debug scripts follows the source code. The first is the virus as 
    compiled from the source code below. The other is the virus that was 
    released as beta version.

 ;
 ; TRACER reads host program instruction so that the jump to virus
 ; code is placed some bites away from the host program entry point
 ; (first instruction that is not a branch). In most cases, TRACER 
 ; would be able to place the jump to virus after four or six 
 ; instructions away from the entry point. But there would be cases 
 ; where this would be placed much farther.
 ;
 ; Most AVs that use the entry point to scan for viruses would not
 ; be able to detect the viruses. For those that would be able to 
 ; detect the virus we need encryption to hide our virus.
 ; 
 ; The only danger in using TRACER is that a possibility exists that 
 ; the virus would be corrupted during the execution of the skipped 
 ; host program codes. Although this is unlikely to happen, still 
 ; the possibilty of it happening is is there.
 ;
 ; Another side effect is in programs that displays a message at
 ; the start of the program. In that case, the messages would be
 ; displayed twice which would give away the presence of the virus.
 ;
 ; The instructions skipped by TRACER are:
 ;
 ;       Instructions                    Operands
 ;
 ;       INT                             10/11/12/16/1a/some 21
