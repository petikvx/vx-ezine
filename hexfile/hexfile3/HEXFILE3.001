                               PhVx Register


   This PhVx listing is divided into four parts: 
   
        Part I   covers PhVx found in the wild a copy of which is in 
                 HEX-FILES collection. This is further subdivided into 
                 sections. Viruses in Sections A and B are confirmed 
                 PhVx and the rest are probable PhVx.

        Part II  covers PhVx published in HEX-FILES. 

        Part III covers viruses found in Filipino virus authors' web  
                 sites.

        Part IV  covers viruses mentioned in AVs virus lists and 
                 documentations as originating from the Philippines or 
                 from indications the virus is from the Philippines. 


   The origin of viruses in Part IV still needs verification. When a 
   copy is obtained and the source could not be ascertained, this would 
   be placed under probable PhVx until such time the origin of the virus 
   is determined. Viruses mentioned in VSUM as originating from the 
   Philippines are not acceptable unless independently corraborated by 
   another source.

   The PhVx in Parts I, II and III were scanned using AVs coming from 
   the Philippines and other countries. Their identifications are then 
   cross-referenced. Alphabetically, the AVs are:

        Philippines: DisCoVir 1.09
                     ViRem 2.00a
                     Vkill 0.40
              World: AVP 3.0 b120 up980607 (Kami)
                     F-Prot 2.28b (Frisk)
                     FindVirus 7.84 (Dr Solomon)
                     Sweep 3.10 (Sophos)
                     Thunderbyte 8.06 (ESaSS)
                     ViruScan 3.1.7 v3105 (NAI)

   Philippine AVs are those circulating at school or downloaded from 
   Philippine AVs' web site. Foreign AVs were downloaded from their own 
   web sites or pro-AV ftp sites. The AVs are not necessarily the latest 
   versions.

   The following conditions are followed during scanning:

        1. The AVs used are all evaluation copies. DOS command-line 
           version of the AV is used, if available.

        2. The PhVx were scanned using *AVs default configuration*. The 
           only option enabled is the creation of a scanning log file, 
           if available and not implemented as a default.

        3. The infected files used are COM programs, that is, if the
           virus is able to infect COM programs, otherwise, EXEs are 
           used. The host programs are those that appeared in HEX-FILES 
           as debug scripts or a file containing similar instructions.

        4. The entire file infecting collection is scanned using each AV 
           program. 

           If an AV says the file is infected but does not mention a 
           specific virus name, a second scanning of that particular 
           file is made to determine if it could detect the virus when 
           no other virus known to that AV is present. This is resorted 
           to because in the real world there would often be only one 
           kind of virus infecting a system at a given time. 

           At present, this only affects Thunderbyte's detection result.
           The method followed is as follows:

           a. Four directories are created on an empty disk. 

           b. An infected file is placed in the root directory, two on 
              the first directory, three on the second, four on the 
              third, and, five on the fourth. 

           c. If the AV detects an unknown virus on at least one file,
              then the virus is reported as detected by that AV.

        5. Boot sector infectors are scanned from 1.44 mb diskettes. For 
           those that could not infect 1.44 mb diskettes, the virus boot 
           sector is forced patched to a 1.44 mb diskette boot sector. 

        6. If the AV detects the PhVx through its heuristic or generic 
           algorithms but does not mention a specific virus name, the 
           identification is prefixed with "=" as in "=Type_ComTSR", 
           "=virus", etc. 

           PhVx that are detected but the AV is not definite on its
           identification (such as in "This virus is like...",  "new or 
           modified variant of....", "....related", "....unknown?", and 
           the like), the virus name used by the AV is preceded by a "=" 
           as in "=WpcBats", "=June12th", etc.

           A "-" means the AV did not detect the PhVx. 


   This is not an endorsement of AVs nor their performance vis-a-vis 
   PhVx. AVs are mentioned here for their virus IDs so that you can find 
   your way through the virus naming mess.
