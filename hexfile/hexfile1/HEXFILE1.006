    Cara is the first file-infecting virus that originated from the 
    Philippines. It is just fitting that the first issue of HEX-FILES 
    includes this virus.
            
    For the analysis of the virus, I will give way to August Li's article 
    which appeared in OnDisk! Magazine No. 7 (July 1991) and the entry of 
    Cara in CaroBase.

       CARA: A Commented Disassembly by August Li
       ------------------------------------------
         
       I have almost fully disassembled the virus and here are my 
       findings.
         
       Virus name : Clandestino Auto-Reproductivo Anti-virus 
                    (C.A.R.A.)
         
       Description:
         
       1. Infects COM files only.
         
       2. Adds 1024 bytes to infected file.
         
       3. Occupies 2048 bytes in memory.
         
       4. Checks system memory if it has been decreased. It will display 
          the following message and exit the program.
         
          Virus es en memoria!
          Clandestino
          Auto-
          Reproductivo
          Anti-virus 
          
         
       5. Will go memory resident if Int 61, Int 62, Int 63, Int 64 are 
          free. If not, it simply chains to the original COM file.
         
       6. Takes over Int 20, Int 21, Int 13 and when executing, will 
          intercept Int 24 in order to handle critical errors.
         
       7. At every fourth floppy disk read, the boot sector is checked 
          for presence of the following virii: (The ID used is only ONE 
          WORD, so the probability of false alarms are very high.)
         
          a.) Italian Bouncing Ball (Ping Pong)
          b.) Microbe
          c.) Stoned
          d.) (c)Brain
          e.) <unknown>  (last two virii I could not identify)
          f.) <unknown>
         
          If any of the virii is present, the boot sector is overwritten 
          with C.A.R.A.'s own code, which simply displays the following 
          message (with a beep) and halts the boot up process:
         
          Disco es infectado.Reemplaza "Boot".
          Clandestino
          Auto-
          Reproductivo
          Anti-virus 
          
         
          If none of the virii is present, it stamps the boot sector with 
          a boot vaccine. The vaccine is "Tri vaccine" w/c protects 
          against:
         
          a.) (c)Brain
          b.) Pentagon
          c.) Microbe
         
       8. It monitors the following DOS functions:
         
          a.) Open file
          b.) Get/Set file attribute
          c.) Execute program
          d.) Rename file. If the filename has a 'COM' extention, it will 
              proceed to infect the file.
 
    Comments: This virus is a local virus, since it can detect Microbe. 
              This virus uses VIR-X's Tri Vaccine. This virus is 
              detectable and removable by VIR-X, although it is not 
              documented in VIR-X. (Hey, Luis, this needs some 
              explanation ...) This virus is an anti-virus virus, 
              although I do not think that making it a virus is a good 
              idea since no one has control over it.
         
       1. It is easy to modify it to become destructive.
         
       2. It might hang systems running multitaskers, other TSRs, etc.
       
       3. It occupies unnecessary diskspace due to multiple copies.
         
       4. It takes up memory.
         
       5. Not everyone appreciates having vaccines on the boot sector of 
          their floppy disks. (Vaccines causes problems on some non-
          standard disks, e.g. copy protected disk)
         
    Search string for SCAN users: You can add this line to a text file 
    (e.g. VIRUS.SIG) that can be used by SCAN to detect C.A.R.A. (e.g. 
    SCAN /EXT VIRUS.SIG):
         
                 "B44ABB00B0CD2181EBC000B44ACD21B4" C.A.R.A.

 PsK Comment:
 
 In addition to August Li's comments, a letter appeared on March 1991 
 issue of PC Digest regarding Cara vis-a-vis Luis Sarmenta's Vir-X Plus:
 
   "Speaking of viruses, the version of VIR-X Plus is the only anti-
    virus which I have detects the presence of the C.A.R.A. virus 
    despite the absence of VIR-X.FVS. I believe that VIR-X Plus is 
    the only anti-virus utility which detects this virus."
 
 The response appeared on the April 1991 issue of PC Digest:
     
   "Vir-X author Luis Sarmenta confirms that his program does indeed 
    handle this virus. He adds, however, that it does not do any 
    intentional harm. He notes: `In fact, it is an anti-virus, 
    C.A.R.A. means Clandestino Auto-Reproductivo Anti-Virus. I think 
    it's not a harmful virus in itself but the panic it may cause 
    could be a big problem.' To avoid panic, Sarmenta did not mention 
    the virus in the documentation of Vir-X Plus."
 
 If you want to get more info and specifics on Cara, I will have to 
 refer you to Mr. Sarmenta. The last I heard is that he is studying 
 in USA. His last e-mail address is

 What follows is the assembly source of Cara.Standard.1024 virus. If you 
 want to create the original virus (including the insertion of nops), you 
 will have to use masm 5.0 to compile this program:
 
      masm cara-std;
      link cara-std;
      exe2bin cara-std.exe cara-std.com
 
 If you are going to use a86 4.02 (it will not create an exact copy of 
 the original virus), you need to place a size override (byte ptr) on 
 memory operands with immediate second operand. compile in a86 to know 
 what part of the code needs fixing. 
 
 you will not get the original virus exactly if you use tasm, which 
 suppresses the nops.
 
 I tried to run my specimen of the virii nor the first generation of the 
 virii on a 386 up to pentium cpus, but was unsuccesful. You might be 
 able to run the infected programs on an XT or 286 based computers.

 컴 CARA-STD.ASM ENDS HERE 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
 
 
 
 
 This is the first generation of the virus created by compiling the 
 cara-std.asm in masm 5.0.
 
 To create an executable program, cut the debug listing below and save it 
 in a file named cara-std.scr. Then
 
      debug < cara-std.scr
 
 The executable file cara-std.com is created.
 
 Even if the virii does not work on my test machine, it might work on 
 yours. So better know what you are doing.
