                                PhVx and CARO
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
          One thing we, who are interested in virii, are very concerned 
    about is the way AVs name virii. 
 
          In the early 90's, a guideline for naming virii was formulated, 
    the CARO virus naming convention. People thought that this will bring 
    order to the chaos. Probabably due to lack of cooperation and 
    coordination, the AVs went on their own way in naming virii. Old 
    virii whose CARO name had been already set were still changed by AVs 
    to suit their own ends. This resulted to virii having several CARO 
    names.
 
          If the leading AVs do not agree with each other in naming 
    virii, what more of Philippine AVs who are not aware of the CARO 
    guidelines. Of the three local AVs of note, only one is moving 
    towards compliance to the CARO guidelines, in its own way. 
    Oftentimes, the three AVs do not use the same name for a PhVx.
 
          This is what HEX-FILES wants to straighten out and hopes to see 
    uniformity in the names used for PhVx at least in the Philippines if 
    not in the global AV and VX community.
 
          I formulated a simplified guideline in naming PhVx. This is 
    based on and conforms to the CARO guidelines. A PhVx is named in the 
    format:
 
            Family_Name.Group_Name.Major_Variant.Minor_Variant
 
    1. Family_Name
 
       The new PhVx is only given a new Family_Name if it is found not to 
       belong to an existing Family_Name.
 
    2. Group_Name
 
       The new PhVx is only given a new Group_Name if it is found not to 
       belong to an existing Group_Name.
 
       If the existing members of Family_Name are not grouped into 
       Group_Name and the new PhVx does not differ in structure to 
       existing members, Group_Name can be omitted and members of 
       Family_Name are instead identified by Major_Variant. 
 
       However, if the new PhVx differs with other members of 
       Family_Name, existing members of the Family_Name are given the 
       "Standard" Group_Name if no descriptive name can be arrived at. 
       The new PhVx is given an appropriate Group_Name.
 
       If Family_Name is segregated into groups, all members of 
       Family_Name should be a member of a Group_Name.
 
    3. Major_Variant
 
       The new PhVx Major_Variant is often its infective length. The 
       Major_Variant can be omitted if there is only one member of 
       Group_Name, or Family_Name, as the case may be.
 
    4. Minor_Variant
 
       The new PhVx is only given a Minor_Variant if there exists at 
       least two members of Group_Name (or Family_Name as the case may 
       be) having the same Major_Variant.
 
 
    I came up with names for existing PhVx based on the above guidelines. 
    Names currently used by AVs were considered. Where the current name 
    used is not acceptable, a new name descriptive of the PhVx is used. 
    Everybody is enjoined to use the following:
 
 
    Cara.Standard.xxxx        Cara is a universally accepted name.      
    Cara.Kara.xxxx            However, with the release of Cara.Kara in 
                              HEX-FILES, it is only proper to separate  
                              them into groups.                         
 
 
    Danao                     Xed would have been fine if there was no   
                              Jerusalem.Bad_Illusion which displays this 
                              text. To avoid confusion, the name DisCoVir
                              uses is adapted.                            
 
    
    Jerusalem.Bad_Illusion    It is accepted that this is a member of    
                              Jerusalem family. However, I could not     
                              accept 1735 (not descriptive enough) or Xed
                              (to avoid confusion) as Group_Name.  It 
                              displays the text "Bad Illusion".           
 
    
    June12.xxxx               This is the first name for the virus. AVs
                              chose Mabuhay instead because activation  
                              date can be easily changed. Text can be  
                              easily changed also, encrypted or not.   
 
    
    Microbe                   Universally accepted, but drop the 's'.
 
 
    Msu                       This is a more descriptive name for the   
                              virus as it covers the two existing       
                              variants, which based on virus            
                              descriptions, originated from two campuses
                              of MSU - Iligan City and Marawi City.      
 
    
    Oggo                      This is what the author/s wanted it called,
                              so let's give them credit.                  
 
    
    Pempe                     Universally accepted.
 
    
    Possessed.xxxx            Universally accepted. Could have been
                              grouped separately but for lack of a  
                              descriptive name.                    
 
 
    Quaint                    I do not how DisCoVir came up with that    
                              name. Due to lack of a descriptive name, it
                              is accepted.                                
 
 
    Rebolusyon                This is more descriptive than Qark, Quark 
                              or any other name. Written by someone who 
                              symphatize with the revolutionary movement
                              and this is a text displayed by the virus. 
                              Name first used by FVR, former name of     
                              ViRem.                                    
 
 
    Sampo                     Universally accepted.
 
 
    Tadpole                   Universally accepted, but drop the 's'.
 
 
    Wpc_Bats.Ala-Eh.xxxx      This is the Family_Name most AVs use.
    Wpc_Bats.Lipa.xxxx        Although Ala-Eh and Lipa are almost  
                              similar, grouping them separately is
                              necessary for clarity.               
 
                              The main difference between Lipa and Ala-Eh 
                              is that infection made by those belonging 
                              to Ala-Eh group aligns the victim program 
                              to paragraph boundary before infecting it. 
                              Those grouped in Lipa infects the victim 
                              file by a constant length, adds 100 years 
                              to the date stamp and is DIR stealth.

    The following is the CARO guidelines for naming virii. The complete 
    file (naming.zip) is available at http://www.chibacity.com/chiba/
 
 
 
                     A New Virus Naming Convention
 
 
    At a CARO meeting in 1991, a committee was formed with the objective
    of reducing the confusion in virus naming.  This committee consisted
    of Fridrik Skulason (Virus Bulletin's technical editor) Alan Solomon
    (S&S International) and Vesselin Bontchev (University of Hamburg).
 
    The following naming convention was chosen:
 
    The full name of a virus consists of up to four parts, desimited by
    points ('.').  Any part may be missing, but at least one must be
    present.  The general format is
 
            Family_Name.Group_Name.Major_Variant.Minor_Variant[:Modifier]
 
    Each part is an identifier, constructed with the characters
    [A-Za-z0-9_$%&!'`#-].  The non-alphanumeric characters are permitted,
    but should be avoided.  The identifier is case-insensitive, but
    mixed-case characters should be used for readability.  Usage of
    underscore ('_') (instead of space) is permitted (and even
    encouraged), if it improves readability.  Each part is up to 20
    characters long (in order to allow such monstriosities like
    "Green_Caterpillar"), but shorter names should be used whenever
    possible.  However, if the shorter name is just an abbreviation of 
    the long name, it's better to use the long name.
 
    1. Family names.
 
    The Family_Name represents the family to which the virus belongs.
    Every attempt is made to group the existing viruses into families,
    depending on the structural similarities of the viruses, but we
    understand that a formal definition of a family is impossible.
 
    When selecting a Family_Name, the following guidelines must be
    applied:
 
                                    "Must"
 
    1) Do not use company names, brand names, or names of living people,
       except where the virus is provably written by the person.  Common
       first names are permissible, but be careful - avoid if possible.
       In particular, avoid names associated with the anti-virus world.
       If a virus claims to be written by a particular person or company
       do not believe it without further proof.
 
    2) Do not use an existing Family_Name, unless the viruses belong to
       the same family.
 
    3) Do not invent a new name if there is an existing, acceptable name.
 
    4) Do not use obscene or offensive names.
 
    5) Do not assume that just because an infected sample arrives with a
       particular name, that the virus has that name.
 
    6) Avoid numeric Family_Names like V845.  They should never be used
       as family names, as the members of the family may have different
       lengths.  When a new virus appears and a new Family_Name must be
       selected for it, it is acceptable to use a temporary name like
       _1234, but this must be changed as soon as possible.
 
                                   "Should"
 
    1) Avoid Family_Names like Friday 13th, September 22nd.  They should
       not be used as family names, as members of the family may have
       different activation dates.
 
    2) Avoid geographic names which are based on the discovery site - the
       same virus might appear simultaneously in several different 
       places.
 
    3) If multiple acceptable names exist, select the original one, the
       one used by the majority of existing anti-virus programs or the
       more descriptive one.
 
                                  "General"
 
    1) All short (100 bytes of code or less, messages excluded)
       overwriting viruses are grouped under a Family_Name, called
       Trivial.  The variants in each family are named by their infective
       length.
 
    2) The relatively small viruses which do nothing but replicate and
       which do not contain anything particular that can be used to name
       them, are grouped in the following six families:
 
       SillyC   - Non-resident viruses, which infect only COM files;
       SillyE   - Non-resident viruses, which infect only EXE files;
       SillyCE  - Non-resident viruses, which infect both types of files;
       SillyRC  - Resident viruses, which infect only COM files;
       SillyRE  - Resident viruses, which infect only EXE files;
       SillyRCE - Resident viruses, which infect both types of files.
 
       The variants in each family are named after their infective 
       length.
 
    3) The trivial boot and master boot sector viruses which do nothing
       but replicate are grouped in two families:
 
       SillyP - Trivial master boot sector infectors
       SillyB - Trivial DOS boot sector infectors
 
       The variants in each family are named after the contents of the
       2nd and the 3rd bytes of the infected boot sector in hexadecimal
 
    4) All overwriting viruses written in a high-level programming
       language are grouped in a single family, called HLLO. The
       particular language used in the virus doesn't matter. The names of
       the variants in this family conform to the same rules as the Group
       names (see below).
 
    5) All companion viruses written in a high-level programming language
       are grouped in a single family, called HLLC.  The particular
       language used in the virus doesn't matter.  The names of the
       variants in this family conform to the same rules as the Group
       names (see below).
 
    2. Group names.
 
    The Group_Name represents a major group of similar viruses in a virus
    family, something like a sub-family.  Examples are AntiCAD (a
    distinguished clone of the Jerusalem family, containing numerous
    variants), or 1704 (a group of several virus variants in the Cascade
    family).
 
    When selecting a Group_Name, the same guidelines as for a Family_Name
    should be applied, except that numeric names are more permissible -
    but only if the respective group of viruses is well known under this
    name.
 
    3. Major variant name.
 
    The major variant name is used to group viruses in a Group_Name, 
    which are very similar, and usually have one and the same infective 
    length. Again, the above guidelines are applied, with one major 
    exception. The Major_Variant is almost always a number, representing 
    the infective length, since it helps to distinguish that particular
    sub-group of viruses.  The infective length should be used as
    Major_Variant name always when it is known.  Exceptions of this rule
    are:
 
    1) When the infective length is not known, because the viruses are 
       not yet analyzed.  In this case, consecutive numbers are used (1, 
       2, 3, etc.). This should be changed as soon as more information 
       about the viruses becomes known.
 
    2) When an alpha-numeric name of the virus sub-group already exists
       and is popular, or more descriptive.
 
    4. Minor variant name.
 
    Minor variants are viruses with the same infective length, with
    similar structure and behaviour, but slightly different.  Usually the
    minor variants are different patches of one and the same virus.
 
    When selecting a Minor_Variant name, usually consecutive letters of
    the alphabet are used (A, B, C, etc...).  However, this is not a very
    hard restriction and longer names can be used as well, especially if
    the virus is already known under this (longer) name, or if the name 
    is more descriptive than just a letter.
 
 
    The producers of virus detection software are strongly usrged to use
    the virus names proposed here. The anti-virus researchers are advised
    to use the described guidelines when selecting names for new viruses,
    in order to avoid further confusion.
 
    If a scanner is not able to distinguish between two minor variants of
    a virus, it should output the virus name up to the recognized major
    variant. For instance, if it cannot distinguish between
    Dark_Avenger.2000.Traveller.Copy and Dark_Avenger.Traveller.Zopy, it
    should report both variants of the virus as Dark_Avenger.Traveller.
 
    If it is also not able to distinguish between the major variants, it
    should report the virus up to the recognized group name.  That is, if
    the scanner cannot make the difference between
    Dark_Avenger.2000.Traveller.* and Dark_Avenger.2000.Die_Young, it
    should report all the variants as Dark_Avenger.2000.
 
    At last, if the scanner is also unable to distinguish between the
    different groups, it should output only the family name of the virus
    (Dark_Avenger in our example).
 
    5) Modifiers.
 
    It is possible that a virus belongs to a particular family by its
    structure, but the virus writer has used some kind of concealing of
    this fact. Such concealing could be the conversion of the virus into 
    a polymorphic one by linking one of the avialable polymorphic engines 
    to it, or by compressing it with some executable-file compressor 
    (e.g.,PKLite, LZEXE, etc.). The latter method is of concern only if 
    the virus is able to spread in compressed form. Since one and the 
    same virus could be concealed with different methods (or even with 
    more than one method), this could cause classification confusion.
 
    Such viruses should be classified as if the concealing mechanism has
    not been used, with a modifier appended to their name. This modifier
    indicates the particular concealing mechanism used. If the concealing
    tool conforms to a naming hierarchy, it's full name (e.g., TPE.1_3)
    should be used as a modifier. When the modifier indicates a
    compression tool, only the first two characters of the name of the
    tool should be used.
 
    For instance, the Pogue virus is a member of the Gotcha family, but
    uses the MtE.0_90 polymorphic engine. Therefore, its full name should
    be "Gotcha.Pogue:MtE.0_90".
 
    It is permitted to use more than one modifier in the full name of the
    virus, if the virus uses more than one concealing mechanism, e.g.
    "Civil_War.1234.A:TPE.1_3:MtE.1_00:PK".
