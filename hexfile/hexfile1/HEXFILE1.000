          Mabuhay!
 
          Welcome to the first issue of my zine.
 
          I am Putoksa Kawayan, a Filipino and a resident of the City of 
    Manila, Philippines. One of the things that caught my interest is 
    computer virii. 
 
          I had been collecting virii for some time now. I had assembled 
    a modest collection of these virii found in the wild here in the 
    Philippines. These are mostly new virii as I was not able to get some 
    of the early virii because I was very young then. 
 
          Aside from collecting virii, I also write virii whenever I am 
    forced to stay indoors, such as when there is a strong typhoon or 
    when my weekly allowance runs out. While my classmates were into 
    Wordstar and BASIC, I was already into assembly on my own. Our 
    teacher who could hardly teach us BASIC (learned on a seminar one 
    summer vacation), what more with assembly he doesn't know of. As I 
    was into this on my own and due to the absence of good sample 
    programs, I disassembled a virus to learn more on handling files. As 
    a goal, I decided to write a virus of my own. This is how I became 
    fascinated with virii.
 
          The first virii I disassembled was Possessed. Whatever bad 
    things people said about Gumba, his Possessed told me things that 
    books never did. As I disassembled more virus, the more I learned how 
    to do things another way and all that stuff. So you see folks, virii 
    are not that bad, if you look at it in perspective. Before, I am just 
    like you. Whenever I find the dreaded *VIRUS* on my disk -- I was 
    quick on the trigger finger and my av is always on the ready.
 
          My first virii is based on Possessed, but is not a Possessed 
    clone. But looking at it, you could find something Possessed-like 
    here and there. But it has something that Possessed didn't have - 
    encryption. 
 
          This multi-level encrypted virii became a self-modifying, 
    multi-level encrypted virii and is now a full multipartite,  self-
    modifying, multi-level encrypted virii. All of my virii are not 
    released except for a few copies which went to the virii collections 
    of friends. Never did I intentionally release these to the wild as I 
    did not have the heart to infect another person's disk or files 
    whoever he may be. I decided to put up this virus zine, HEX-FILES, 
    instead.
 
          Why did I choose HEX-FILES for a name? Just like many others in 
    the VX side of this world, I like 40Hex. I like the way it was 
    presented - no frills and very light. When I decided to put up a zine 
    of my own, I wanted it to look like 40Hex. The "HEX" part is in 
    cognizance of 40Hex. I was thinking of something which will sound 
    nice with hex. That's when I saw a local computer magazine's cover 
    story - "Hexed Files". It sounds like x-files, a tv show I like to 
    watch, and it is a good description of virii. (In fact, the cover 
    story was a pun on x-Files.) But it was a bit too long for my title 
    page (see above), so I dropped the 'ed' and placed a hyphen instead. 
    And that's the long and short of the story on how HEX-FILES got its 
    name. Comprende.
                             
          To give HEX-FILES a direction and purpose, I formulated the 
    following objectives:
 
          1. To present virii that originated from the Philippines, both 
             confirmed and widely believed to be of Philippine origin. 
             From hereon, these virii are collectively referred to as 
             PhVx;
 
          2. To serve as a forum for Filipino virus authors to present 
             their work;
 
          3. To maintain a list of PhVx; and
 
          4. To encourage and promote standardization of names used for 
             PhVx.
 
          I do not encourage and would not encourage writing of 
    destructive virii or writing of virii in general. But there are many 
    out there who are coding virii. College teachers are even encouraging 
    their computer majors to write virii as project in assembly language 
    courses. HEX-FILES is intended for those who already write virii. 
    These virii might find their way to HEX-FILES and could include 
    destructive codes.
 
          An exception to my self-imposed rule on not writing destructive 
    codes is if it concerns AVs and AV like settings of your computer. I 
    would rather kill AV progs before they zap me. It's a matter of 
    survival. As in real wars, civilians are hit in the crossfire. One of 
    these civilians is SCANDISK of DOS. Others that use AV like names 
    will also be hit. My apologies to the makers of these programs. Do 
    not use AV names or you will be hit hard and hit hard it shall be.

   *      HEX-FILES does not carry live virii. However, program listings *

          There's nothing much in this issue. Starting next issue we will 
    have some of the newer virii and also some old stuff. The focus will 
    be on virii created by students from Adamson University: Possessed 
    and Oggo. And I hope I could find the diskette where I kept the 
    source code of the Philippines virus. Plus more...
