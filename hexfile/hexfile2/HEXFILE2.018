   *      HEX-FILES does not carry live virii. However, program listings *  
   * and scripts found in HEX-FILES create first generations of virii,   * 
   * infected programs, virii droppers or other virii related programs   * 
   * when compiled. This was intentionally done so that we could avoid   * 
   * someone from executing these programs without exactly knowing what  * 
   * they are doing. Believe me, there are people stupid enough to do    * 
   * this.                                                               * 
   *                                                                     * 
   *      If you create an executable program out of those listed in     *
   * HEX-FILES means that you are fully aware of the nature of these     *
   * programs and the consequences of using these programs. You also     *
   * agree that HEX-FILES and/or everybody connected with HEX-FILES in   *
   * any way are not responsible for any damage that may result from the *
   * use or misuse of these programs.                                    *  
   *                                                                     *
   *      You, being the person who created the executable program       * 
   * and/or executed the program, bears full responsibility for your     * 
   * actions.                                                            *
   *                                                                     *
   *      Furthermore, you fully agree that these programs would only be *
   * used for research and/or educational purposes. In no way should     *
   * these programs be used to inflict harm or damage on another         *
   * person and/or his property.                                         *

    Programs in HEX-FILES are presented as assembly language source code 
    (*.asm) or debug scripts (*.scr). The suggested name for the assembly 
    source code or debug script is indicated before the listing. The 
    compiler used to exactly recreate the virus is indicated at the start 
    of the assembly listing. If another compiler is used, you might not 
    be able to recreate the exact virus and instead create a new variant 
    of the virus.
 
 
 
    How to create an executable program
 
    1. Open the selected file in a text editor. You can also use your 
       word processor but you will have to save it as a plain text or 
       ms-dos text file. Save a back-up copy of the file. Most files 
       contain both asm and scr listings, and others contain multiple 
       listings.
 
    2. Cut everything from the start of the file up to the line which 
       says
 
             ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ xxxxxxxx.ASM starts here ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
       or    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ xxxxxxxx.SCR starts here ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 
 
    3. Cut everything from the line which says
 
             ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ xxxxxxxx.ASM ends here ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
       or    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ xxxxxxxx.SCR ends here ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 
       up to the end of the file.
 
    4. Save the file as xxxxxxxx.ASM or xxxxxxxx.SCR, as the case may 
       be. Remember to save the file as plain text or ms-dos text file.
 
 
    5. Compile the listing
 
       5.1. For debug scripts, the command line is 
 
                 debug < xxxxxxxx.SCR
 
            An executable file is created, usually a com. If the created 
            file is an exe, it will have an .ex_ extension. Rename to 
            xxxxxxxx.exe to make it executable.
 
       5.2. For assembly source codes, the listing is written in a way 
            that it could be compiled by different compilers, 
            specifically A86 4.02, TASM 2.01 and MASM 5.0. Other 
            compilers could be used but might require code fixes.
 
         5.2.1. Command line for A86 version 4.02
 
             5.2.1.1. Create COM program with org 100 directive 
 
                         a86 xxxxxxxx.ASM
 
             5.2.1.2. Create COM program with org 0 directive 
 
                         a86 xxxxxxxx.ASM xxxxxxxx.COM
 
             5.2.1.3. Create EXE program
 
                         a86 xxxxxxxx.ASM xxxxxxxx.OBJ
                         linker xxxxxxxx.OBJ
 
                      You can use tasm's tlink, masm's link or another 
                      linker of your choice. a86 does not have a separate 
                      linker program.
 
 
         5.2.2. Command line for TASM version 2.01
 
             5.2.2.1. Create COM program with org 100 directive 
 
                         tasm xxxxxxxx.ASM;
                         tlink /t xxxxxxxx.OBJ;
 
             5.2.2.2. Create COM program with org 0 directive 
 
                         tasm xxxxxxxx.ASM;
                         tlink xxxxxxxx.OBJ;
                         exe2bin xxxxxxxx.EXE xxxxxxxx.COM
 
                      You can use other binary converter instead of 
                      exe2bin.
 
             5.2.2.3. Create EXE program
 
                         tasm xxxxxxxx.ASM;
                         tlink xxxxxxxx.OBJ;
 
 
         5.2.3. Command line for MASM version 5.0
 
             5.2.3.1. Create COM program
 
                         masm xxxxxxxx.ASM;
                         link xxxxxxxx.OBJ;
                         exe2bin xxxxxxxx.EXE xxxxxxxx.COM
 
                      You can use other binary converter instead of 
                      exe2bin.
 
             5.2.3.2. Create EXE program
 
                         masm xxxxxxxx.ASM;
                         link xxxxxxxx.OBJ;
 
 
         5.2.4. For other compilers, refer to the program documentation 
                or see the compiler's help screen.
 
 
 
     Availability of Compilers/Programs
 
     1. DEBUG.EXE comes with Microsoft's operating system. If you are 
        using ms-dos you have debug unless you deleted it.
 
     2. EXE2BIN.EXE comes with ms-dos but was dropped from ms-dos 6. A 
        replacement binary converter is available from shareware sites. 
        However, if you still want exe2bin, I think you can download a 
        copy from microsoft.
 
     3. A86 is a shareware program and is available from shareware sites 
        or you can get it from its distribution site at
 
                          http://eji.com/a86/index.htm
 
     4. TASM and MASM are commercial programs. If you are interested, get 
        in touch with Borland and Microsoft, respectively.
 
        However, if like me, you couldn't afford to buy these programs 
        (with my meager allowance and the dwindling value of the 
        Philippine peso, how could I), a copy is available from your 
        friendly warez and virus sites. I won't tell you where but...
 
                      Look and you shall find
                      Knock and it shall be opened unto you
 
     5. For other compilers, I guess you can find many shareware assembly 
        compilers in the Internet.
