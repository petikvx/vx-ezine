                      Philippines 1A and Philippines 1B 
 
                         (fixed to work on all CPUs)
 
 
    I fixed Philippines 1 virus just for you. So let us get to know it 
    first.
 
    When I first wrote this virus back in 1993, I wanted to do something 
    different. Something that has not yet been seen in the Philippines at 
    that time.  I also wanted to force AVs to make extra efforts if they 
    want to cleanly remove the virus from an infected program. The 
    easiest to do this is through encryption. That's what I did and I 
    overdone it a bit. I made several layers of encryption, made the 
    encryption mask on some layers variable, and scattered the data 
    needed by AVs to put a program back to what it was before. This way 
    AVs have to peel off each layer of encryption if it wanted to restore 
    an infected program. AVs can opt for the easy way out by deleting the 
    infected program. So folks, don't blame me if AVs delete your files. 
    It's their fault and not mine.
 
 
    What does it do? Aside from infecting programs, it does mischief and 
    fulfills one of my dreams -- become a swimmer.
 
    * The Infection * It is found at the end of files because it is 
      easier done this way and I would not have to overworked your drives 
      from too much read and write. I also align your programs before 
      infecting it. So in addition to the length of the virus, you would 
      get one to 16 bytes more. I also set the read-only attribute of 
      infected programs so that you would have a hard time deleting it. 
      Oh, the virus only infects on EXEC (21/4B00)
 
    * The Encryption * The virus in COM is encrypted in three layers, 
      with the second layer split in two parts in some cases. In EXE, the 
      virus is encrypted six times. The portion from the start of the 
      virus up to the EXE entry point is encrypted in three layers. 
      Portion from the EXE entry point routine up to the end of the virus 
      is also encrypted in three layers, with the possibility of 
      splitting the second layer into two. The "Philippines" at the end 
      of the virus is not encrypted because it is my signature.
 
    * The Mischief * The virus also checks for get/set file attribute 
      (21/43) and file open (21/3D). If the program is COM or EXE, I 
      check it for infection. If it is not infected, I let it do what it 
      asked for in the first place. However, if it is already infected...
 
      ...If you asked to see the attributes set for a program, I would 
         let you see it except for the read-only attribute which I hid. 
         If you requested to set an attribute, I would force the setting 
         of the read-only attribute whether you like it or not. You would 
         not be able to delete an infected file through DOS.
 
      ...If you opened an infected program, I would open it for you but 
         would let you think that you had failed. (This is my way of 
         preventing AVs from scanning an infected program :), but it does 
         not work against all AVs. :( ) I would open the file, set the 
         error flag, and would return to you with the error code for 
         "file not found". The file handle of the opened program is not 
         saved. If you tried to open too many infected programs you might 
         run out of file handles which would neccessitate a system reset.
 
    * The Wish * One of the things I really wanted to do is learn how to 
      swim. What with the nice beaches near you. (But don't try to swim 
      in and around Manila Bay unless you are a masochist or have 
      suicidal tendencies. Don't you know that it is very expensive to 
      die. Have pity on your family who are going to shoulder all those 
      expenses.) But no can do. You see I have this fear of going into 
      water more than waist deep without something firm and solid to hold 
      on to. Since I couldn't swim, I just have to content myself on 
      being a good swimmer in my dreams. And, now, in your computers too.
 
      I set up an Int 8 handler (Didn't I tell you in HEX-FILES No. 1 
      that Possessed taught me a lot of things. This is one of them. 
      Other parts of this virus I got ideas, directly or indirectly, from 
      Possessed.) so that you would not be able to break off from it. 
      Even Windows crashes. There are two triggers: length of time (about 
      four hours) and infection count (at least on the 98th file 
      infected). When these are met, I would display the swimmer happily 
      doing my version of the breast stroke in your screen. You would 
      need to reboot to end the show.
 
      If the swimmer is too fast or too slow in your computer, increase 
      or decrease the value of DI in "DoDelay" routine. The value of DI 
      currently set is just fine for my Pentium 166.
 
      An improved swimmer is in Philippines 3 (aka Kakabakaba).
 
    Two debug scripts are included here. One is a compilation of the 
    first fix, Philippine 1A, which is just enough to make Philippines 1 
    work on my computer. The other, Philippines 1B, has more changes in 
    the code. I would only present you with the source of the Philippines 
    1B because Philippines 1A is almost similar to Philippines 1.
 
 
    Enjoy....

 ;-------------------------------------------------------------------
 ; 
 ; You can use *TASM 2.01* or *MASM 5.0* to compile this source code. 
 ; The executable program created by TASM and MASM would be the same.
 ; However, there would be differences in the first generation codes
 ; which do not affect the main virus code and, therefore, does not 
 ; concern us.
 ;
 ; If you would be using A86, you would need need to fix the forwardly
 ; addressed data.
 ;
 ; Compile to EXE.
