    Mabuhay!
 
 
    For this issue, we are going to have....
 
 
    ** A list of virus related mailing lists both pro-av and pro-virus 
       orignating from the Philippines.
 
 
    ** An encore for Matthew with two articles and a disassembly. 
 
         *The Virus Writer's Resume* An article by N.O.Phoenix on his 
           thoughts about virus authors. It bares little known facts 
           about Matthew and the identity of its author. If Jonjon Gumba 
           is EDP head of a hotel in Metro Manila, where would the 
           Matthew author be? Illegaly cutting pine trees in Baguio City 
           for the Christmas season? Read on to find out.
 
         *Virus Verse* An article written by Alan C. Robles published in 
           the February 10, 1995 issue of the Philippine Daily Inquirer. 
           This article is reprinted WITHOUT PERMISSION AND KNOWLEDGE of 
           the author or the newspaper.
 
         *Matthew.2667* A disassembly of the seldomly seen, if you have 
           seen it at all, variant of Matthew. Know why it did not spread 
           as much as Matthew.3044. Virus program listing was created by 
           YeZ. 
 
 
    ** YeZ of Zamboanga City, shares with us his disassembly of two local 
       variants of Jerusalem and Danao. Program listings for this three 
       viruses were created by YeZ.
  
         *Jerusalem.AllSystem9.1818* was made to appear to have been 
           written by the owner of a computer chain cum training center. 
           Virus has tricks to make your life terrible.
 
         *Jerusalem.Bad_Illusion.1238.A* This seems to be the first virus 
           to have come from XED. And, according to form, it intends to 
           create havoc. The text in the virus says that XED is/was 
           attending school at University of Cebu.
 
         *Danao.2869*  This virus was for a time thriving well in well in 
           the wild and was giving people a lot of headache. This virus 
           was written by XED. Text in the virus might mean that he is 
           from Danao City in the province of Cebu.
 
       Before I forget, Se¤or YeZ hablo Chabacano. Yo no hablo Chabacano 
       y Espa¤ol. I only used a Spanish-English dictionary for this. :) I 
       don't know if I got it right.
 
 
    ** We are also going to have something about Wpc_Bats family.
 
         *Payloads of Wpc_Bats*  We are going to have a program that 
           would show you five screen payloads of the virus family, 
           including one that was disabled by the author. 
 
         *Disasembly of Wpc_Bats variants, namely, Wpc_Bats.Ala-Eh.3161, 
           Wpc_Bats.Ala-Eh.3072, Wpc_Bats.Ala-Eh.3161, Wpc_Bats.Lipa.2793 
           and Wpc_Bats.Lipa.3207. The program listings of the five 
           variants would give you an exact copy of these variants if you 
           would only follow the compiling instructions. 
 
           However, AVs, specifically, F-Prot and FindVirus, use values 
           of far pointers to determine variants. If the values of these 
           far pointers are not those expected by them, they would say 
           that the file is infected by a new/unknown virus variant. If 
           that happens, it is not my fault anymore. It is not right to 
           assume that bios interrupts vectors found in the IVT always 
           points to the segment of the bios.
 
 
    ** Lorz is from Albay and is a member of Pinoy Virus Writers. Lorz 
       submitted three Word macro viruses. These are the only new virus 
       you would find in this issue. 
 
         *Margaret* A multi-language infector with a nice payload.
 
         *Mary* A polymorphic infector and pops a message on a certain 
           day.
 
         *Mykah* A stealth macro virus with some retro-virus functions. 
           Watch out! It might format your hard disk!
 
 
    ** Finally, corrections to virus program listings which appeared in 
       past issues: :(
 
         *Cara.Standard.1024* I made typographical errors on this one. :(
 
         *June12* Because I placed my initials in a data portion of the 
           virus, F-Prot and FindVirus detected the three June12 variants 
           in HEX-FILES No. 3 as unknown variants. :( 
 
           To humor the AVs, I have here three program listings that 
           would not make the AVs ask you to send them copies. But if 
           these two AVs start affixing .A, .B.... to the three June12s 
           from HEX-FILES No. 3, I would like to remind all lamers out 
           there that there are still 65,534 other possible two-byte 
           combinations.
 
 
 
                                     <o>
 
    
    Starting this issue, executable programs are presented in uuencoded 
    scripts instead of our usual debug scripts. This was resorted to 
    because debug scripts jacks up the size of files. It is also too much 
    for big files like the word document that carries Lorz macro virus. A 
    script created by uuencode has a low overhead.
 
    However, if you prefer debug scripts over uuencoded scripts, tell me 
    so that I could make adjustments for the next issue.
 
    A uudecode program is in HEXFILE4.021 in debug script. You could also 
    look for a copy from shareware archives.
 
                                      
                                     <o>
 
 
 
    Whats up in the Philippine virus front?
 
       Mikee's World web page got zapped. However, a member is planning 
       to revive the group. Mikee is out of the action and Mikee's World 
       is floundering.
 
 
       Pinoy Virus Writers main web page has moved after its previous 
       main web site at tripod got zap. PVW's main web site is now at:
 
                   http://sourceofkaos.com/homes/brianjan/
        
       Pinoy Virus Writers would also be issuing the fourth issue of its 
       zine, PVW, not later than December 1998.
 
 
                                     <o>
 
    Well this is all for now. Here's wishing you all an advance 
 
                               Merry Christmas

   * HEX-FILES does not carry live virus. However, program listings and  *
   * scripts found in HEX-FILES create first generation viruses,         * 
   * infected programs, virus droppers or other virus related programs   * 
   * when compiled. This was intentionally done to prevent someone from  *
   * executing these programs without exactly knowing what the programs  *
   * really are. Believe me, there are people stupid enough to do this.  *

    Next issue we would not have any disassemblies. We would have 
    something old and new, but no disassemblies. We might have this 
    early (?????) next year. 
 
    Got to do something first. 
 
           Ang pangako ko kay Zoom23 ay napako.... 
           Bubunutin ko muna ang pagkapako nito.   :)

                       may flat rate na, may metro pa!
