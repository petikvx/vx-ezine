                           The Virus Writer's Resume

    Virus Writers are not at all different from you or anybody else. In a 
    pool of Virus Lovers, the only difference that I could think of is 
    the mere and obvious fact that they have already coded, compiled and 
    run their own computer virus or viruses.
 
    Hey! Everybody has to start somewhere and being a Virus Lover is an 
    edge and if you dream to become a virus writer yourself then stop 
    reading this article and go practice.
 
    The best tools a person could really have to achieve his/her goal is 
    not in the kind of software or computer language to use but rather 
    CURIOSITY and PERSEVERANCE. Without these two, then you cannot even 
    go a step farther from where you are. A person has to learn to accept 
    failures and face the fear for new ideas. To become a virus writer is 
    not a TALENT but a hard earned TROPHY for those long sleepless nights 
    of tedious coding, researching, trials and errors, then the  only 
    evidence of your success is your creation itself, i.e. Your Virus.
 
    A Computer Virus in plain sense is just a computer program. But 
    looking at it deeper you see not the things it can actually do but 
    rather the character, creativity, motives, ideas, intents, how much 
    time the author has put into it and as much as everything the Author 
    sees or thinks during the actual process. This explains why some 
    viruses are as destructive as overwriting data and as complex and 
    convoluted as those that goes almost invisible in an infected system.
 
    Some Virus Writers do this things just for the mere reason of "DOING 
    IT"; some for FAME and have their work included in some popular 
    antivirus software; some for revenge and some for practical jokes, 
    some to prove a virus' worth as a useful tool as the case of the CARA 
    virus (AN ANTI-VIRUS VIRUS.)
    
    There are a lot of reasons or motives for a person to write a virus 
    and that makes each VIRUS unique and writing one is a wonderful and 
    irresistible endeavor to take.
 
    Throughout my computer career, I have seen as many virus as I have 
    seen legit programs. Being a virus lover and writer, I have learned 
    to appreciate much of the locally made ones like June12, PEMPE, 
    POSSESSED, OGGO, SAMPO, MATTTHEW and many others. As I have said, I 
    like these viruses not for what they do but more on the character 
    behind them.  Each of these viruses is a programmer who spent wee 
    hours in the morning tweaking just to give birth to his creation.
 
    The June12 virus in my own interpretation was not created for the 
    bare reason of NATIONALISM because of the National flag and anthem it 
    displays but of a unique and creative mind to do something different 
    and was not done at that time.
 
    The Possessed virus, also a unique product of a curious and creative 
    individual who may have gotten the idea due to rising popularity of 
    the news that a computer can be stricken ill during those years of 
    virus awareness. Showing the DEVIL'S FACE on the screen of an 
    infected system vividly displays this fact.
 
    The Pempe Virus is one example of a virus that could have been 
    written for revenge as alleged by one student of the opposite camp, 
    The virus displays on the screen the word PEMPE and AMACC which they 
    say stands for AMA COMPUTER COLLEGE.
 
    The OGGO virus could have been written as an attempt to race in the 
    annals of VIRUS WRITERS during those years and a text included in its 
    message shows OGGO VIRUS by the PALPAK GROUP of ADU.
 
    The SAMPO virus, a boot sector virus is a product of the University 
    of The East, its origin and name was based from the displayed text 
    that goes "SAMPO PROJECT X ... University of the East." This virus 
    could been written as a challenge to write a boot sector virus as 
    this type of virus are quite rare in the Philippines.
 
    Among others, The MATTHEW virus became the center of my interest. As 
    unique as it could be, it actually displays a BIBLE passage and 
    believe to have originated from BAGUIO city.  It contains the text 
    "RMO", "SW&SH", "the bible passage from mat."  And some other stuff.  
    Basing it from a date I found inside the virus body I remembered a 
    friend from Baguio City and called him up to give me some info 
    regarding this virus.
 
    According to him the program, including its variant, was written by a 
    guy named "RAYMOND M. ORDONA" and his not a teacher as the case for 
    the HERMELITO GO virus but he (Ordona) was a co-student during those 
    days in SLU.
    
    They were as I remember one of the first batch of Comp-Sci students. 
    As the virus de-mystify in one phone call, the text "RMO" became 
    clear as it actually came from the Author's initials and the "Bible 
    Passage" was obviously an influence of the school itself as SLU is a 
    Catholic School handled by Italian priests.  The "SW&SH" actually 
    stands for "SWORD and SHIELD". My friend could not tell what or where 
    Ordona got this but it is believed to be a student body in SLU. 
    Looking closely at the Author, he was said to be a book worm, 
    mathematician, in short a genius. He worked here in Manila for some 
    time and went to the United States. At present, he works at (name of
    a big database company) as a computer consultant.
 
    You as a programmer with great zeal to learn and experiment could be 
    one of these individuals who have made it to the halls of virus 
    writers, all it takes is being yourself and putting character to your 
    work. Be unique. Don't just copy or revise other's work but learn 
    from them and formulate your own way to achieve a much better result. 
    Start slow. Try to absorb the essentials then go for more complex and 
    serious stuff.

    I removed the name of the company where Ordona works at the last
    minute.

    pass it through me. Sorry, but he is not ready to face the world 
    himself. I guarantee that he would get your message. If you still do
