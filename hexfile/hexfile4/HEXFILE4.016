                Virus Related Mailing Lists from Philippines
 
 
 
    Do you want to hear on what's the latest on viruses in the 
    Philippines? Then you'll have to subscribe to mailing lists, 
    especially those that are focused on viruses.
 
    There are now three such mailing lists. One is pro-VX and the rest 
    are pro-AV. All mailing lists accepts posts by e-mail.
 
 
    1. Pinoy Virus Writers Mailing List/Discussion Group
 
    This mailing list is maintained by Zoom23, the bosing of Pinoy Virus 
    Writers. Posting mainly consists of news about the Pinoy Virus 
    Writers and the goings on in the pro-virus scene.
 
    To subscribe, you need to go to Zoom23's web site at:
 
                   http://sourceofkaos.com/homes/brianjan
 
    Or, for help, you can write to:
 
           brianjan@mailcity.com  or  pinoyvirii-help@listbot.com
 
 
 
    2. RP-VIRUS Echo Mail of Fidonet Philippine Zone
 
    This mailing list is an echo of the local Fidonet virus forum. This 
    is a moderated forum and is pro-AV. But pro-VX sentiments are also 
    tolerated, but be prepared to get sideswiped.
 
    Discussions are mainly focused on viruses currently spreading in the 
    wild and similar rumors. Feeds from this mailing list is not 
    consistent. Sometimes, your mailbox is swamped with messages and at 
    times, there's a long stretch that you are not receiving anything. 
    But I heard that this virus forum is very active in the BBS. The 
    frequency of feeds from RP-VIRUS probably depends on the mood swing 
    of the moderator. :)
 
    To subscribe, send e-mail to listserv@cyber.org.ph with only the 
    following in the body of your e-mail:
 
    subscribe RP-VIRUS
 
    If listserv returns an error, try "susbscribe RPVIRUS" instead. 
    (Messages for posting are sent to rp-virus@cyber.org.ph)
 
    You would be asked to confirm your subscription. This confirmation 
    should be sent to listserv@cyber.org.ph
 
    The international Fidonet virus echomail is also available for 
    subscription. If you are interested, ask the help of the  
    postmaster@cyber.org.ph for details.
 
 
    3.  Philippine Anti-Virus Mailing List
 
    This is the newest of the three mailing lists. Invitations to join 
    just got out second week of November. As it is still new, I do not 
    know how it would come out. The invitation says the mailing list 
    would deal mainly on notices of new anti-virus releases, virus alerts 
    and hoaxes.
 
    This mailing list is maintained by the Philippine anti-virus web site 
    at http://members.xoom.com/phil_av/
