   Guys forced me to publish a matrix which I used to create some
   predictive polymorhical encryption engine (based on emm3 ideas).
   Because MGL's matrix published in our zine #1 was really poor I created
   a better one, including 386+ opcodes of course.
   However this matrix presented here is also quite obsolette, and I
   started to build up a new one some weeks ago, but Katmai and Athlon
   specific opcodes overlaps a lot, so it tooks me more than a week to get
   rid of it and after that I accidentaly deleted what was already done.
   And you can imagine - I was so angry so I didn't started again :)

   To use this matrix, you should at first install a true-type fonts
   (supplied) which I used in these excel sheets: using control panel -
   fonts - file - install new fonts. And you can print it as big as you
   wish, and start marking opcodes and groups you need to optimize your
   engine :) Good luck!

                                                                     Flush
