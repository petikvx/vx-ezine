                                Dark Paranoid

   This is another elite contribution to our zine. So, after some time
       passed from release of this beautifull piece of code, we can
       present it to the virus comunity. I would like to express my
       unlimited thanx for allowing me to publish the source code to the
       author. Coder of Dark Paranoid, known under handle Terror-6, is one
       of the young Slovak programmers, who are countinuing the work of
       Vyvojar - to bring to the world new, never before seen viruses of
       the finest slovak quality. So far, according available information,
       Terror-6 is working on something, but no one knows, what it is. But
       we can hope, it will be some wild thing.

   And now, let's talk about Dark Paranoid. This is very unusual com'n'exe
       com'n'exe file infecting resident virus. The approximate lenght of
       code, which is appended to target file is about 6 kB. When
       infecting com files, the Dark Paranoid 'll place own code to the
       start of file and the original contens of file 'll be moved behind
       the viral body. Exe's are infected as usual, the virus is appended
       to the end of file and the header 'll be manipulated to point to
       the virus. But what makes Dark Paranoid so unusual is its
       polymorphism. This virus is polymorphic even in the memory. In
       every moment, only one instruction from virus is unencrypted. After
       execution of this instruction occurs INT 1. Handler of INT 1 'll
       reencrypt executed instruction and decrypt next one. Decrypted
       instruciton 'll be execuded and excrypted again. And this is the
       princip of Dark Paranoid's "ENGINE OF ETERNAL ENCRYPTION". If you
       think, that INT 1 handler could be used as possible scanstring, you
       are so hopeless and crap ...

   When author spended such a amout of time and beer to code such a
       beutifull virus, and then he allow to catch it in memory with
       simple scanstring, he 'd be a big jerk. So, dear Averz and dear
       virus friends, handler is slightly polymorphic. On every
       instalation to the memory is this handler changed.

                                [vsepar.gif]

   Virus avoids to infect files, which starts wiht 'AV', 'SC,' 'CL', 'GU',
       'NO', 'FV', 'TO', 'TB'. In plain text, Dark Paranoid 'll not infect
       AVP, SCAN, CLEAN, GUARD, NOD (but ICE 'll be infected :(((( ),
       FINDVIRUS, TOOLKIT and TBAV. Dark Paranoid 'll also avoid to infect
       baits and goats.
       Dark Paranoid contains payload - it prints on the screen text Dark
       Paranoid and shakes the screen.

                                [vsepar.gif]

   Finally, all I have to say is - enjoy the code.
