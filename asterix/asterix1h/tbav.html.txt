              This is just little article to keep you informed.

   The big world of bussines is ruled just by one golden rule. This rule
       is very simple. Big fishes use to eat smaller ones ! Only in some
       exceptional cases can small fish eat bigger one. The latest victim
       of this rule has well known name, especially in the virus
       underground. Because i wanna tell you its name. Read my lips ....
       TBAV, Thunderbyte Antivirus, produced by ESSaV B.V., a Netherland
       based company is no longer independent ! As stated by TBAV
       officials, TBAV "decided to become a part of NORMAN Group". In
       plain text Norman bought up the TBAV technology and research team.
       This fact means not only the change of product name to Norman
       Thunderbyte Virus Control, but also probably new, and more
       agressive advertising for the product.

       And this advertising makes me laugh. Just for ilustration, some
       quotations from Norman Data Defense System materials.

   [art_desk.gif] ... Norman Thunderbyte Virus Control never become
   obsolete. [but they provide updates every two months ]
   [art_desk.gif] ... Norman Thunderbyte Virus Control is always one step
   ahead of the virus writing community [ I think, this 'll be joke of the
   year, or am I not right ? :)))) ]
   [art_desk.gif] ... Norman Thunderbyte Virus Control is one of the few
   virus scanners able to understand OLE2 format ... This means full
   detection capability of Macroviruses, even encrypted ones ! [ Just
   check out Slovak_Dictator Marcovirus on other place in this issue to
   get the corrected opinion :))) ]
   [art_desk.gif] ... cleaning utility, which enables all users to quickly
   and effective remove all macroviruses. [ I want to see it, dudes :) ]

       Historia est magistra viteae. In the past, we've shitload of
       tricks, how to piss TBAV, how to deactivate its resident driver etc
       ... In the past, they always were (and always 'll be ) viruses,
       which forced AVers to less or more change their products. TBAV was
       no exception. And they should be one step ahead ? Stop kidding ! We
       will see...
