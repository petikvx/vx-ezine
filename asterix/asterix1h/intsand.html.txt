   [intwho.gif]    Interview with MrSandman of 29A

   ... known as Tarantino's film lover.
   As i wanted to gain some interviews for this issue i started with Sep.
   But due some problem with my mailer daemon, actually the first
   interview was this one. Lem'me introduce dude from Spain, who stayed
   some time in Romania. I guess, that the Romania episode was the reason
   why Mr. Sandman started to write viruses. Just for explanation. Romania
   borders on Bulgaria.... And Bulgaria.....

                               [intsepar.gif]

   [intq.gif] Can you introduce yourselves ?
   [inta.gif] Well, we're just a group of friends who knew themselves in a
   BBS, started changing ideas and decided (me) to found a virus writing
   group and release a virus magazine. Most of us are studying a career at
   the university, other are in the military service, and the rest are
   studying at the school, very near to start a career.
   [intq.gif] Your relationship to girl, beer and another lovely subjects
   [inta.gif] Hehe... well, my relationship with my girlfriend is ok, we
   even travelled to India and live (sometimes) together in a flat of
   mine... we've been going out for more than a year :)
   About beer, i'm sorry, but i don't like it :) I don't like drinking, i
   only do it in very special circumstances. Other lovely subjects could
   be music, cinema, and, of course, computing and writing viruses.
   Anyway, i don't have many free time, as i have a lot of exams and a lot
   of unreplied BBS and Internet mail... i guess you know this situation
   :)
   [intq.gif] When and why did you start to be interested in computers ?
   [inta.gif] I had my first experience with a 8088 bought by my brother,
   when i was only 6 or 7. I didn't have any adaption process or shit like
   that, i just liked computers since the first time i knew them. Anyway,
   i must say that my first love was my first Macintosh :)
   [intq.gif] Your first contact with virus ...
   [inta.gif] It was some time after buying my first Mac, with a virus
   called WDEF with which there were some infected applications my brother
   brought from his work. Anyway, it was also an AV contact, as i did a
   disinfection work with an application called ResEdit (the equivalent in
   Mac OS for the debug.exe of DOS) :)
   Two years later, more or less, my PC got infected with the
   Traceback.3066 virus, and that's when i really got interested on
   viruses, albeit i could not do any 'serious' work until i got a modem
   and downloaded more virus stuff (especially virus magazines) from
   spanish underground boards.
   [intq.gif] What about your first virus ?
   [inta.gif] Heh... well, there were some projects. The first virus i
   coded was a 30-byte-more-or-less overwriting infector :) Later i wrote
   an appending non-resident COM infector, later i tried the EXE
   infection, SYS files, etc. And that's when i started combinating
   different kinds of infections and inventing some new original stuff.
   The boot/MBR thing came later, but that's something i never liked,
   dunno why... this is... i can write a boot/MBR infector in two minutes,
   but i don't like them at all; don't ask me the reason :)
   [intq.gif] How did u land in 29A staff ?
   [inta.gif] Well, actually i never landed... it was the rest of the
   people who did it :) We all used to interchange ideas and material via
   a spanish BBS called Dark Node; one day i realised that we had enough
   stuff to release a zine, and then i proposed it. Many people accepted,
   so we founded 29A and we started to work in order to release our first
   zine asap.
   Anyway, in 29A there's no staff, there's just a boss who takes
   decissions according to the opinion of the rest of the members, but
   there are no 'range' differences between us.
   [intq.gif] Perspectives of polymorphism
   [inta.gif] Polymorphism has some advantadges if we compare it with
   other viral techniques such as stealth, for instance. There's no any
   unique routine which mutates viruses, it's something very personal,
   more personal even than a virus itself. So it depends on the
   imagination of a virus author to write a powerful-supercomplex poly
   engine... anyway, right now we must focus the slow poly stuff, as it's
   the unique way to fuck AVers and make them worth of the money they
   earn.
   And this last thing depends on the point of view of each virus author;
   some of us bet for originality, other writers prefer to release their
   viruses and see how long do they stay in the wild... so there's no any
   unique answer.
   [intq.gif] Perspectives of stealth
   [inta.gif] Stealth is almost dead, it's the opposite thing to
   polymorphism. There are very few stealth techniques, as everybody uses
   the ones which already exist... they only vary a little if you mean
   full stealth, as it's something which takes a bit more of time.
   They work, so everybody uses them; they're very simple, so it's very
   difficult to write something really original and special on them.
   Anyway, Super (new 29A member!) has something to say about this ;)
   [intq.gif] New systems (W95, NT OS/2 ) and viruses ...
   [inta.gif] Since Bill Gates is the wealthiest man in the earth right
   now, we must assume that Windows (and i don't mean Windows95 or NT) is
   the future. Heh, anybody could make all the people think that a crock
   of shit is good, and even eat it... if he has the money Bill Gates has
   :)
   Operating systems such as Linux, OS/2 and Mac OS are very good, but
   they will die soon as the number of dickheads increases every day. Of
   course, Windows95 won't be the definitive operating system... anyway, i
   think that it's a positive thing to spend our time trying to find out
   more stuff about PE infection under Windows95, as things won't change
   radically in a LOT of time.
   [intq.gif] Today I got a message about first virus under Linux. What do
   you think about it
   [inta.gif] Good news for the virus community, of course :) That's the
   second part of the future... 50% will be Windows-dickheaded users, and
   50% will be Internet applications developers who will work under
   Linux/Unix with programming languages such as Java.
   Anyway, Linux is still a very 'rough' operating system which evolves
   with very slow but firm steps into a definitive consistent alternative.
   [intq.gif] Virus as weapon ( bunch of paranoid geeks like
   NSA,CIA,DIA,SIS 're asked to skip this question and answer)
   [inta.gif] It'd be very difficult to write such a virus (if you're
   expecting a good success ratio), cause it'd have to be a slow
   infector... but not so slow, cause it'd then leave more time for people
   to discover it. It'd a good idea to copy itself into unusual places,
   either using the cavity infection method or the Pascal/C trick used by
   Zhengxi and Lucretia.
   There would be much more doubts about this, such as, for instance,
   wether to be small (the virus) but with a stupid encryption, or to be
   around 10k long, but encrypted with five highly polymorphic complex
   engines.
   [intq.gif] As an Spanish dude, can you describe local virus scene ?
   [inta.gif] There's no scene besides 29A in Spain... there are many
   underground boards, but almost all of them without any special
   relevance. The two most important underground BBSs in Spain are Dark
   Node and Edison's Temple. In both of them you can find a lot of virus
   writers, but most of them are members of 29A, or just write a common
   virus from time to time.
   It seems that hacking/phreacking is more popular here. In fact,
   Edison's Temple is a hacking-oriented BBS, just ask Mr. White or
   Wintermute, two of the most important persons there.
   [intq.gif] The same stuff as previous but AV
   [inta.gif] Some time ago there was an antivirus called Skudo, written
   by a dood from Barcelona called Jordi M=A0s. Anyway, it was designed
   for preventing against viruses, not for detecting/disinfecting them. As
   its author left Barcelona and now lives in France, we didn't know
   anything else about Skudo.
   There are some other 'pure' AV packages, such as Artemis, Panda,
   Oyster, XScan, PC-Cillin, and so on, but they're just commercial shit
   (the typical ignorant dickheads who claim that their antivirus detects
   over 9000 viruses , you know...).
   [intq.gif] Your favourite virus and why
   [inta.gif] Errrhmm... never had anything clear on this. I think i'd
   choose Zhengxi as my favourite virus, as it's the most complex i've
   ever seen in my life, and there are still lots of unexplored (commented
   tho) things on it which can be used in other viruses.
   It's original, it uses a very insidious infection way, it's the most
   difficult virus to detect/disassemble, and its poly engine is
   *awesome*.
   [intq.gif] Your favourite antivirus programm and why
   [inta.gif] AVP, of course. It's the most professional (well, i'd even
   say it's the unique professional AV), very reliable, easy to use for
   lamers and very flexible for gurus, it's the one which
   detects/disinfects more viruses, and the unique AV which includes so
   necessary (and easy!) techniques such as disinfecting known viruses in
   memory. Its code analyzer is the best, and it's probably the most
   difficult AV to fool. Besides, i love AVPUtil and AVPRO, two utilities
   of its registered version :)
   [intq.gif] Vx coder you would like to meet personally and why
   [inta.gif] Dunno, this is probably the most difficult question. I think
   Qark, he's very funny, he's the virus writer i admire most, and i have
   a very good relationship with him; of course, i'd like to meet other
   people i admire a lot, such as Quantum, Stormbringer, Rajaat, Q the
   Misanthrope... who knows, there are a lot.
   All the 29Aers usually meet in Spain two or three times a year, and we
   ave a lot of fun, we even bring computers to our meetings, so we can
   execute/write viruses, and so on :) Of course, it would be very nice to
   do an european VX meeting, that would be da freak! ;)
   [intq.gif] AV people you would like to meet
   [inta.gif] I'd like to meet Kaspersky in order to discuss technical
   stuff... in other to do other things, i'd rather choose Patty Hoffman,
   for masturbating in her tits, Vesselin Bontchev, in order to suggest
   him a new haircut, and Frans Veldman, for waking him up.
   [intq.gif] Are there in Spain some laws against viruses and their
   author?
   [inta.gif] There's just a law which forbids to modify/destruct any
   data, but there's nothing against writing self-reproducting code and/or
   releasing it, you're guilty only if you're the one who executes it
   intentionally.
   [intq.gif] What do you think 'bout maniacs who want to bust and
   prosecute us, the vx coders and would like to erase the vx scene ?
   [inta.gif] I call that envy. They can't just understand that the word
   'virus' doesn't imply 'destruction' necessarily, so they can't
   understand that many people enjoy themselves writing viruses, just as
   other people do when they paint pictures or watch TV. They'd probably
   like to know how to write viruses without having to use VCL, but their
   morality forbids them to have any kind of relationship or contact with
   people in the virus scene.
   [intq.gif] Your plans 4 the future as coder and in general
   [inta.gif] Just to release a lot of highly succesful 29A issues and to
   have more time to spend on doing the thing i like most: writing
   viruses. Never mind if they work under DOS, Windows, Windows95 or
   GameBoy, it's just to feel again the sensation of having written
   something really original and interesting to the rest of the people.
   [intq.gif] Last but not least : can you point us to some interestin'
   online resources on the internet ?
   [inta.gif] Well, i'm not very used to navigate through the Internet,
   but anyway i have some interesting addresses in my bookmark...

   [intq.gif] So thanks, Mr.Sandman. Was very nice you spending some time
   with this interview.
   [inta.gif] It was nice to answer all your questions, best luck with
   your magazine! :)
