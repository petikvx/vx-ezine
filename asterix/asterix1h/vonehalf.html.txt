                  The only authentic One_Half source code.

   Editorial
       You may remember the time of its Outbreak. It was horrible, unknown
       and effective. It encrypted your data. It was One_Half. Still on
       the scene, still in the wild, still in the wild list. Here comes
       the source.
       Disclaimer
       The code presented below is one of the most successuf virus in the
       history. It can (under some circumstances) destroy your data. If
       you compile it, its on you what you 'll do with the exacutable
       file. We don't care. Guilty for any damage is that asshole, who
       executes it.

   Dear friends
       some time has already passed since the great days of One Half
       epidemy.Nevertheless we still hope that a code of this popular
       virus inspires you also now. A lot of stuff has been written on the
       subject, so I tink, not many words are necessary about this little
       creature any more. And, so, here is the original source of
       One_Half.3577.

   OneHalf.3544
       OneHalf aka Slovak Bomber aka Explosion II is multipartite resident
       com'n'exe virus. When infected file is executed, OneHalf infects
       the MBR of the harddisk. The original contens of MBR 'll be stored
       on track 0, on in the 8th sector, when we count from the last one.
       MBR 'll be altered and the viral body 'll be placed in last 7
       sectors of track 0. Then OneHalf looks for last active DOS
       partition table (or extended patrition table). Then number of first
       and last sector of this partition 'll be computed and stored at
       offset 29h in MBR. Starting from this moment, on every system
       reboot virus subtract this variable by 2 and encrypts 2 cylinders
       which are pointed by this variable. This means very slow disk
       encryption. The encrypted areas on disk are decrypted on demand,
       but only when virus is memory resident. Attempts to remove virus
       via clean boot and FDISK /MBR are the best way to lost your data. I
       just forgot to say, that OneHalf is stealth virus. Onehalf infect
       files on floppy discs and network drives, but not on the local hard
       drive. This is very good and effective strategy of spreading. We
       were told, the virus was in the very beginnig planted in the field
       on 3 computers in university lab. And look - now it is spread world
       wide.

   In the infected file, the virus decryptor is divided into 10 parts,
       which are spread across whole the infected file. These parts are
       connected together by 2 types of jumps and of course, there are
       here some garbage instruction, randomly choosed from 10 possibles.

   When one half of the disk is encrypted, virus, depending on the system
       date and generation prints to the screen following message:

   Dis is one half.
       Press any key to continue...

   The body contains also string "Did you leave the room ?", related to
   Explosion virus by the same author.
