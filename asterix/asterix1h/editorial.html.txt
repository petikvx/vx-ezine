   [intro.gif]

   [d.gif] ear reader, please allow me to introduce the first (and i hope
   not the last at the same time) issue of our zine. I hope, everyone 'll
   find in this isssue at least two or three articles, which 'll be for
   him of some value.

                              [separ_blue.gif]

   [w.gif] e would like to focus our mag not only on virii, but also on
   the rest of the H/P/A/V. Ofcourse, we don't want to present only own
   stuff, every piece of your activity, dear reader, 'll be great. If you
   're author of the ultimate, kick-the-ass virus or utility, or just want
   to tell your latest experiences or opinions to the rest of comunnity,
   contact us ! We would like to make your stuff public.

                              [separ_blue.gif]

   [r.gif] emember, not everyone is virus&asm guru, so we 'll bring some
   stuff, which for some of you dudes, could be trivial or lame. But for
   someone it could be good example or ever the inspiration for own start
   as vx coder.

                              [separ_blue.gif]

   [l.gif] ast but not the least, we 'll try to bring some interesting
   background stories and infos, some virus history related articles and
   more ...

   [w.gif] hy this zine is named '*'? Well, we got several explanations.
   Just choose your favourite one.

   [bluedot.gif] '*' in computer terms stands for wildcard - the sign that
   covers everything.
   [bluedot.gif] '*', which ascii code is 42, was a international code for
   Slovakia, the origin of editors of this zine. However, nowadays we got
   a new dial-code 421 :(
   [bluedot.gif] '*', the number of 42, is the answer to ultimate question
   of life, universe and everything.
