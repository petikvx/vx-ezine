       As i bought in my favourite book store book titled "Modern computer
       viruses - basics, prevention, protection" i was really pleased. But
       this feeling didn't last more than few hours. As i red each further
       page,i became such a strange feeling. As i have substantial part of
       the book red already elsewhere.
       This czech book, titled "Moderni pocitacove viry ....", written by
       Josef Jaluvka, is divided in two parts. First part is the usual
       crap like what virus is and what it does, defines type of viruses
       and etc... Second part, in my humble opinion the substantial, is
       the crutial part of this book. It is quit detailed guide to write
       viruses. But ... I mentioned before my strange feeling bout this
       book. And this second part has brought the proves.

       About 50 % of this book is ripped from various zines, mostly from
       VLAD's, 40hexes, NuKe Journals, but also from serious hardcopy
       publications which are copyright protected. But this author, son of
       the bitch gives not only one fucking credit for stoling the text,
       schemes and sources. Asshole ! Cock sucking motherfucker ! Fucking
       lamer ! DIE !!!!!!!!!
       As i told it to some people, which work was stolen, they were
       really angry. Just one example for all ...

       One former member of vx underground, now retired, was really ungry
       . I was asked not to publish his name and his opinion. But just to
       ilustrate his pleasure, i put here anonymous some of his opinionz.
       [art_a.gif] ... and im not surprised...these books are all shit
       anyway
       [art_q.gif] all yours tutes 're included. But that dick didn't put
       one single credit in that book
       [art_a.gif] ... no shit! what a jerk
       [art_a.gif] ... goddamn fucker. good thing those tutes aren't so
       great anyway :)
       On some other place in the book that 'author' is really without any
       shame. He just ripped series of articles, originally published in
       elite hardcopy slovak magazine, PC Revue. Even the schemes are the
       same ...
       I guess, if the true author of that part in book 'll read this (and
       I know he 'll because he is an AV sucker working for some company
       producingr avir iC), he 'll prosecute that lamer Jaluvka for
       copyright violation. I hope he 'll request at least 1,000,000 for
       that violation. So, i wish you to lost that case, Mr. Jaluvka ....

       Just to ilustrate some of really valuable information in the book,
       imagine this. On page 202, chapter 5.1 "Pasivni obrana" - Passive
       protection, Jaluvka describes how the authorz 're trying make it
       heavier to AVerz. One of these counter - measures should be code
       optimalization. And he gives some excellent xsamplez in table.

       In book two, chapter one, Jaluvka describes some toolz, necessary
       to fight (and write) computer viruses. He describez Techhelp! 4.0,
       some deep-inside-DOS books,sourcer, AFD pro, Turbo Debugger, Qaid
       analyser and ... that's all folk :) He has no idea, that some Ralph
       Brown's Interupt list exist (every good FTP site or BBS has it),
       that some Soft-Ice debugger is on the nearest warez site, and
       ofcos, that there is a shitload of virus zines. But, maybe, this
       omision is just purpous ?

       Although the book cointains couple of useless crap and some really
       screwing mistakes, it could be used as a quit good tute to code
       viruses. But I think, that is not the thingy the author wanted.
       But people, if you are publishing some stuff, do not forget to
       include that funny C in brackets. Just by putting (C)opyright 1997
       by your_name_here you should be protected. And of cos, in case of
       copyright violation you can prosecute the bastard.

       This article is (C)opyright, (c)opyleft 1997 by The Ziggy Zag and
       was written just and only for the bombastic issue #1 of the *-zine.
