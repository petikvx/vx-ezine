   [art_drops2.gif]      Introduction
   Mgl (Mengele.(P)hD?) told me SVL was about to release a newsletter, and
       asked me kindly to contribute a little something to it. He had
       nothing in mind what I do for them (I said no to source-code
       contributions since I didn't feel like decreasing the code quality)
       so I just had think about something myself. Well, this is the
       result, perhaps nothing really worth wasting any time with, you
       decide. My nature is to please anyone whenever I can so don't held
       me responsible for you losing your faith in humanity, society, god
       or whatever. If someone want me to write just something, surely
       I'll do it. If he would've asked if I could give him a blow-job, I
       would though have turned down the request.

   [art_separ.gif]

       This contribution from me is styled VLAD-AF article.2_5 because I
       find the scene way too serious and that article a good read (Yay. I
       wrote it ;)). This mean this can be seen as a early valentine issue
       from myself included in the SVL-e-zine #1. Or it might just bee
       seen as wasted bytes dedicated to wasted souls.
       Notice that the rest of Immortal Riot/Genesis has nothing to do
       with this stuff at all. I assume personal contributions is allowed
       to other zines, specially since MGL contributed to IRG#8. Also
       important to mention is that none of this stuff (I guess) would
       make it into an IRG-sinze due to our new technical styled magazines
       which I hope you all did enjoy!

   [art_separ.gif]

       So... This is from all of me, to all of you - whoever you are. My
       dog surely will like it, but an updated interview with him won't
       follow! Parden me.

          Deadly serious ironic/sacrasm-ish reading and happy '97!

   [art_drops2.gif]      Things to do before physics
   Before I continue writing I'd like to take the opportunity to mention a
       few things that perhaps could easy my burden.
       1). Time to spill out the beans... But who wants to eat them
       anyways? I'm as for the moment writing & doing reserch on an
       article about "why viruses are written, for who they're aimed, why
       viruswriter's keep on doing them, personal motivation for
       viruswriting, why you once started and what you find facinating (or
       at least interesting) with them." So, I'd like *every* writer of
       computer-viruses to email me and write a little something about the
       above mentioned questions. If you feel like adding a few things
       that you find interesting go ahead, let your mind go wild!

   [art_separ.gif]

       You can be anonymous if you like but don't forget to mention that!
       This article will hopefully (most likely) be included in our next
       issue of Insane Reality - IRG#9.
       My email adressess are:
       tuir@hotmail.com
       tuirg@hotmail.com
       tuir@hehe.com
       Notice also that those system's is rather instable, but if you read
       (II) you know I also can be reeched on that adress ( (II) is 9
       lines below this line ).
       2). Part II - Where you rather not want your daughter to be late at
       nights... On http://www.algonet.se/~robry there are some IR & IRG
       files located (ir.html is the file located on that adress btw, if
       that is for any use).
       It's not an offical IRG page but all of IRG.SE know the homepage
       operator and he kindly borrowed us some HD space. Every swedish IRG
       member can also be reeched on that adress - just email
       robry@algonet.se and he will kindly CC (that is abbreviation for
       _carbo-copy_ if my memory isn't totally phucked) them to the
       correct person. Notice though that the official IRG-page still is
       located on:

              http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/9595
       3). I'm just an inspiration for birth-control... My submission
       (other word for contribution Quantum told me ;)) to VLAD-AF
       (Vlad-April Fool's Edition) called "IR#8" contained a little
       challenge - namely to crack "File Encryptor". Well, Sepultura found
       out the 12 byte long key which was "tuir@MAR.C0m" (w/o the
       quote-marks).

   [art_separ.gif]

       The april fool joke from me was that secret.txt never did gave out
       my real information nor it did contain the reasons why my handle
       was The Unforgiven. For those who wonder.. keep on wondering! I
       doubt that it has something to do with suicide though, which some
       brave writer believed.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Also notice that Quantum never did hack immortal.se (since it
       doesn't exist), and ripped "IR8" from there, it was a submission to
       their zine from me, pretty much like this is ;). He wrote that
       information at the end of the article. Well as I figured you never
       did read the entire faked Insane Reality #8 ;) and believed him.
       April sucka. I hope you reech the end of this one :).

   [art_drops2.gif]      Red Hot Chili Faces
   Hmm, I don't quite know where to start, but I would like to comment a
       few personal things at this entry.
       There are a few good reasons why I didn't contribute much to IRG#8
       and beside being very busy with life, university, my gf and the
       general irl-stuff I re-read the IR-zines and felt terrible
       embarrased for them and felt like writing no more. For example, I
       started to write an article called "What good side-effects
       viruswriting can result in", but gave it up. It became too
       personal, abstract and complex. And beside this, it turned huge. A
       short summary of my results might still be included here or
       elsewhere since it's a rather interesting topic. So stay tuned.

   [art_drops2.gif]      The early Insane Reality - Insanity or Reality?
   Well, both really. They're insane, yet real. I was red-phucked-up in my
       face and my heart went ape while reading some articles, specially
       those which included stuff written about girls and politics. And
       yea.. those viruses too. *Sigh*.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Also worth to mention, I wasn't too pride too see some text-strings
       included in my viruses or in programs included as hex-script in
       some zines. (One example is "lord0.com" in IR#7 (reality.010 among
       with basicly, the entire adventure of porno)). For those who've
       been harassed, I'm sorry.

   [art_separ.gif]

   Hrm, about some articles... Really, who're interested in reading about
       some Maria, some Ellinor, some Anette or some other girl? Who're
       really interested in reading about a confused teenager opinions
       about something that he cannot express properly in english? Who
       really bother about a person who ramble on and on and on (like now)
       without giving any information, just pure junk? A real rnd_garbage
       generator, or so? However, for those who really are interested in
       my and my life, junk stuff, etc. paradoxal enough I won't let you
       down, but this time write about something that I can be proud of
       and still will be proud of when I read it in let's say 3 years.
       However, it's still junk though. Do I never just give up?

   [art_drops2.gif]      Current life & general hints, advises and shit
   Current life is cool. I study and spend most of my spare time with my
       close friends or with my gf (name won't be mentioned) who I've been
       togheter with about half a year (so far).

   [art_separ.gif]

       Hints in life is have plenty of sex. If you consider yourself too
       busy or "too of something else.. " change opinions. Nothing is as
       relaxing as it. It's though not good to became a "sex-addict",
       since most addictive things is bad for you, sex being the exception
       as long you have semi-control over it (having sex with yourself
       w/masturbating 5 times a day isn't the way to go). Not only is sex
       great but to really care about someone rocks. Don't let your life
       miss this.

   [art_separ.gif]

       If you smoke just give it up. It smells bad and it won't do any
       good for you. Smoking at parties is alright but it doesn't really
       impress on most ladies. Socially smoking is great, but socially
       being decently drunk is also a killer, so.... it isn't perhaps the
       best way to deal with things'n'shit anyways.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Alcohol. ch3-ch2-oh. This rocks. Don't be sober too damn often.
       Home made whine can rock (and beside it's cheap, it's a good
       hobby...).

   [art_separ.gif]

       Astronomy. Really interesting and is a great thing to discuss,
       philosophy and crapp on about after a few beers. Only a few things
       can be described as complex or simply as this.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Driving-license. Freedom costs. But damnit, it's worth it.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Cooking. Everyone likes to eat, be sure you can do magic in the
       kitchen. Don't rely upon girls to do this for you. Not being
       dependant on other persons is essential in life. I only wish I
       could describe my situation as "not being.. ". Bah, isn't money to
       key to everything? (yes, that might as well include the r@@t of
       evil, too)

   [art_separ.gif]

       One Half. A really good virus, lack bugs and contain a really cruel
       original payload. This issue includes the original source code.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Suede - Coming Up. A really cool album, maybe the best album any
       U.K band ever produced. Sgt.Pepper from Beatles might just be up
       there.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Ford Fairlaine. "Eih.. I fucked him!". Great fucking movie if you
       ask me. Up there along with Eddie Murphy's RAW.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Hotmail. Well, any anonymous mail-system is great if you feel like
       giving your teacher some soft of feedback (critism can be kind of
       sensitive, just trust me..). Http://www.hotmail.com. A cool
       rerouter can be found on http://www.starmail.com (tuir@hehe.com is
       one of those catchy phrases..).

   [art_separ.gif]

       Burger King. Just so much better than fucking McDonald's. Not a
       good place to work on I guess but for lunch (not date-dinner
       though!), it's more than OK.

   [art_separ.gif]

       AVP anti-virus. Love the demo-section. The scanning/cleaning
       capabilities is also really impressive. Along with its
       code-analyser. If only it would ran a little bit faster on my
       machine.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Java, html and high level languages. Well, assembler is cool, but I
       sincerly doubt it will get you any wealthy. Internet and its
       applications is what brings you money. Developing things fast is
       what companies want you to do.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Irc. If used properly (i.e. not sitting there wastening all your
       spare time) irc can be as good as a scrink depending on which
       people you have a conversation with.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Money. I have stated that greed is your worst enemy, so watch out.
       Money tend to change things, beware so it won't mess you up. Might
       just solve your problems better than booze. Booze solve things by
       its nature ;), problems is not included though.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Drugs. If you're afraid to face the reality, change your situation,
       don't flee from it with drugs, computers, irc and shit like that.
       If you can control your use, it will sooner or later turn into
       abuse and you should give it up asap.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Clifton Classic clothes. A sleep-over, black jeans (or ordinary
       Docker's if you prefer that) combined with Sweet Georgia Brown hair
       pomade looks nothing but great.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Insane Reality. For whoever find low-level assembly programming and
       virus-related things interested this is zine to get ;). Hehe, just
       had to mention this.

   [art_separ.gif]

       love. If you don't find someone else to love that loves you back,
       be sure to love yourself. It's great to have a massive, yet humble
       ego.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Studies. Can be quite hard. Compared to life and work it's though
       not as hard as you once believed.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Isaac Asimov. Truely a smart writer. The books about the
       "Foundation" and "robots" are good and cleverly written. Something
       useful to waste your time with and might just get you interested in
       astronomy.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Acqua Di Gio Giorgio Armani. Going around stinking bloody Farenheit
       or some other highly common eau de toilette or after shave always
       manages to upset someone. Be original and expensive in your choice
       of scent.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Coffey. Keep your awake during studies, during hacking, during
       coding. Sleeping is such a waste of time, really.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Oxygen. Can't really without it, however some early viruses early
       in the world's timeline could.

   [art_separ.gif]

        Overrated things

   Hitchhiker's guide to Galaxy. Isn't all that great, really. Has a few
   points, but not worth 900 pages.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Windows/95. Everyone know this OS sucks, howcome everyone is using
       it?

   [art_separ.gif]

       Swedish chicks. They aren't all that neat. The majority is just
       plain trash most of the rest is average. A minority is something to
       have in the long run. Of course, one doesn't realise this on a 1-2
       week long vacation.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Sleeping. Everyone likes this and it's essential it's said. But,
       really, it is like wastening a 1/3 of your life with.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Opinions. Who will listen to you anyways? Who need goddamn
       opinions? Why are you even reading mine?

   [art_separ.gif]

       Technology. Science should be fiction/not truth, dreams/not reality
       and so on.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Neuromancer. Another book not worthy its reputation. William Gibson
       just ain't no good author.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Action movies. Do I have to comment this?

   [art_separ.gif]

   [art_drops2.gif]      Satisfying one's ego
   Here's an interview I filled out for Richard Loearker's book. It will
       be an anti-virus reserach book and I do encourage every viruswriter
       to erase my answers, fill in your answers yourself and send it to
       rilo@xs4all.nl. If you want to add more questions to it, that is
       fine, too.
       I know this is lame, egoistic to include an interview with
       yourself, but this ain't no popularity contest. Do me your worst.
       Personally, everything I've ever written is horrible this piece - I
       see as the exception (i.e. the interview) but that might just
       change if I re-read it in a year. Well.. most things tend to
       change.
       [art_q.gif] What is your handle?
       [art_a.gif] My handle is The Unforgiven.
       [art_q.gif] How did you get your handle?
       [art_a.gif] I found the handle on one of Metallica's albums and
       decided to take it. I liked the song and the alias did somewhat fit
       my person. I don't know exactly why, but metal-music has in a way
       or two always inspired viruswriters so it seemed to be a natural
       handle to occupy.
       [art_q.gif] How old/young are you? (Approx. If you won't want to be
       specific)
       [art_a.gif] I'm 21 years old.
       [art_q.gif] Would you dare to give me your first real name? (Do if
       you want to, don't if you don't want to)
       [art_a.gif] Sure, that would be no problem ;-).
       [art_q.gif] How would you describe yourself?
       [art_a.gif] I prefer not to since your readers would probably think
       of me as some sort of bragger. Ah well, I think I'm a pretty
       ordinary young adult who is a part-time enjoyer of life.
       As for the moment I'm studying on Chalmers University of Technology
       located in Gothenburg (Sweden), and will hopefully be for quite
       some time. I've worked with various things during the previous
       year, among many things computer-security. Although I liked my job
       I decided to get back to school after a moment of clarity.
       Socially I'm really not very complicated. I live a healthy social
       life with really good friends and with my girlfriend who's always
       there for me. I believe I'm very spoild concerning this kind of
       things.
       [art_q.gif] How do your friends and people around see you like? (BE
       HONEST! ;-)
       [art_a.gif] I am not a mindreader, but I do however believe that
       most people have little or no trouble with my humble person. Of
       course, there is always exceptions and honestly I don't deserve to
       be liked by everyone. Hopefully all that is in the past, but who
       knows? Cruelness is one mean habit to kick. It just won't walk away
       all that easy.
       I always try to care for persons who care for me and I'm always
       interested in getting to know new persons. Maybe are those the
       reasons why people accept me for who I am.
       [art_q.gif] Since when did you get involved with virus writing and
       how did you became interested in the first place?
       [art_a.gif] I became interested in viruswriting somewhere back in
       1993. Me and a friend started Immortal Riot - mainly a viruswriting
       group, and I had to start to learn assembly.
       [art_q.gif] Since when did you get involved in a virus authoring
       group?
       [art_a.gif] When I started the group, of course.
       [art_q.gif] What made you decide to join this group?
       [art_a.gif] I didn't join Immortal Riot, I created it. I don't
       though know exactly why I formed yet another viruswriting group,
       but it seemed like a great fun and I tried it out.
       [art_q.gif] How did this group get its name?
       [art_a.gif] I don't have a clue. It did sound cool.
       [art_q.gif] What are the reasons for you writing viruses?
       [art_a.gif] I'm totally clueless! There aren't many good reasons
       really, but viruses facinated me and I wanted to learn more about
       them. The best way to learn more about viruses is to write them and
       so I did.
       [art_q.gif] What is the main purpose of the group?
       [art_a.gif] To write new good undetectable viruses, supply the
       masses with virus related information and knowledge for whoever it
       may concern.
       One of our goals in the beginning was to learn the shit ourself and
       teach echother the knowledge achieved. Ah well, mainly the purpose
       of a viruswriting group is individual. I doubt we had any specific
       purpose really, mainly it was just a fun thing to waste your time
       with.
       [art_q.gif] Approximately, how many viruses have you written?
       [art_a.gif] I couldn't count all updates, new versions and so
       forth. The viruses released in the wild and which has infected
       computers around the globe might be around 30.
       [art_q.gif] Which viruses were a real challenge for you?
       (Masterpiece?)
       [art_a.gif] When I finally got the knowledge to write some good
       virus I got unmotivated and grew bored with it. Mainly I wrote
       viruses whenever I felt like tormenting some computer geeks or when
       I was really upset about something. Nowadays, I've calmed down or
       maybe I just got better things to do with my life? Who knows, I
       might give it another shot, sometime.
       [art_q.gif] Have you written any virus toolkit or add-on?
       [art_a.gif] No, I don't think so.
       [art_q.gif] Why have you written this toolkit or add-on?
       [art_a.gif] ..
       [art_q.gif] What kind of reactions did that program get?
       [art_a.gif] ..
       [art_q.gif] What's your attitude towards antivirus researchers and
       why?
       [art_a.gif] I've no problem with most of the guys "on the other
       side" and most of them do deserve some respect. Some of them have
       though some serious attitude problems with viruswriters, but
       honestly I couldn't care less about them. Some persons have
       problems with everything and this just ain't my burden.
       [art_q.gif] Give me some opinions about and his product. If
       possible, motivate.
       [art_q.gif] ... Frans Veldman (Thunderbyte Scan)
       [art_a.gif] Frans Veldman is a really good low-level programmer and
       TBAV is a technical excellent product.
       [art_q.gif] ... Dr. Alan Solomon (Dr. Solomons Antivirus Toolkit)
       [art_a.gif] I believe Dr.Solly has a huge identity crise or just
       heaps of problems with his very own person. I havn't looked closely
       into his product, but he ain't programming on it himself so it can
       be good.
       [art_q.gif] ... Fridrik Skulason (F-Prot)
       [art_a.gif] I like Frisk a lot! His product is excellent and I
       recomment F-Prot for everyone who are looking for an anti-virus
       program. Fridrik himself is a very nice person and he's also a lot
       like "us" but older. He once stated in an email to me saying
       "viruswriters are a lot like me 15 years ago,", I like him for
       being honest.
       Also notice the comma in the quote before the quotation mark ends.
       Well, let's just say I'm trying to act as a reporter.
       [art_q.gif] ... Eugene Kaspersky (AVP)
       [art_a.gif] AVP is a good product, too. I don't know very much
       about Eugene but I want to believe he's nice.
       [art_q.gif] ... others you would like to give your opinion about?
       (ME? Naaahh)
       [art_a.gif] Nah, I wouldn't waste my time to write anything about
       John Mcafee since everyone knows his product (Scan) sucks bigtime
       and he's a fake.
       [art_q.gif] What is the best line of defence against
       computerviruses and how would you implement it?
       [art_a.gif] To remove all floppy and harddrives and never copy
       anything? :-). Honestly I don't quite know. No system is 100% safe
       against virus attacks.
       Personally I like resident monitors and recommend other persons to
       use them if they're afraid to get a virus (I believe the TSR
       monitor called F-Prot Gatekeeper is a good choice). Some sort of
       scanning software is also good to execute once in a while..
       [art_q.gif] Would you like to work for an antivirus company as
       researcher/troubleshooter? Why or why not?
       [art_a.gif] I would have no problems with that. Would be quite
       ironic and I couldn't say I wouldn't like it before I had tried it
       out.
       [art_q.gif] If someone turns to you for help when his computer has
       a virus, would you help him? Please motivate why or why not.
       [art_a.gif] Sure I would. That would perhaps increase my knowledge
       about these little things and on the same time I would get the
       other persons respect. I've done this several times during the past
       years.
       [art_q.gif] Would you ask money for your help?
       [art_a.gif] Of course not. I dislike greed.
       [art_q.gif] If it turns out to be a virus you have written, what
       would you do?
       [art_a.gif] This too has happend :-). I gave out all technical
       details about the virus (trust me, they got really impressed) and
       wrote a cleaner for it. Voila! Respect earned in a cheap way!
       [art_q.gif] Would you still ask money for your help?
       [art_a.gif] I wouldn't in the first case, so... No, I wouldn't. But
       I would offer them the source code (claimed disasm :)) for further
       investigations.
       [art_q.gif] What would your initial response be if you see a
       newspaper that describes your virus wreaking havoc in:
       [art_q.gif] A government agency?
       [art_a.gif] First I would first laugh my underpants off, but then I
       would be a little bit worried about it. My handle/real identity is
       pretty known afterall so this could get me busted. I think I would
       destroy all evidence so they couldn't prove shits.
       [art_q.gif] A hospital?
       [art_a.gif] That depends. I wouldn't like to see someone getting
       hurt physically by a virus of mine but if it just had infected some
       of their computers or trashed some easy to recover data I'd have no
       worries with it. Of course this is bad publicity, but I can live
       with that.
       [art_q.gif] A large company?
       [art_a.gif] Yummie! I like all daily newspaper reports concerning
       companies getting hit or (prefered) wiped out by a virus of mine. I
       would be happy a day or two then I would forget all about it.
       [art_q.gif] A small company?
       [art_a.gif] I couldn't care to discriminate between large or small
       company. Of course I would like this too.
       [art_q.gif] What would your initial response be if this company
       went broke due to your virus?
       [art_a.gif] I would silently say "Woops, better not trust
       computers, geek." and get paranoid about the consequenses. Surely,
       they would want someone hanged.
       [art_q.gif] What would your initial response be if someone dies in
       the hospital due to your virus?
       [art_a.gif] Shit!
       Really I wouldn't like this to happen. I'm not a weirdo. I would
       probably think about this a lot and after quite some time come to
       the conclusion that it was all an accident and not, - not even
       indirectly - my fault. Then I would try to forget all about it and
       blame the dead vegetable on someone else.
       [art_q.gif] What would your initial response be if the government
       loses all police arrest records due to your virus?
       [art_a.gif] Voila!
       This I would indeed like. But then again, they wouldn't report this
       and just restore the records from backup's. If they had no backup I
       would thing twice about the effects this kind of incident may bring
       and get really paranoid.
       [art_q.gif] How is the law in your country concerning computer
       viruses and what is your opinion about it.
       [art_a.gif] The law is a complete mess.
       I can understand if deliberate spreading of computer viruses is
       considered a crime in some countries, but writing? No way! And how
       easy is it to prove that I deliberate did spread a virus?
       Most laws about viruswriting has a large amounts of flaws. Surely,
       with a good lawyer you will get away with it. Sweden hasn't for the
       moment any specific law which forbids this.
       [art_q.gif] Have you ever been arrested for doing illegal things
       with computer (viruses, phreaking, hacking)?
       [art_a.gif] No. I have never been arrested for anything. Aren't I
       too legal? :-).
       [art_q.gif] Has this arrest altered your view of these activities,
       and, if so, please describe the stage you went through.
       [art_a.gif] ..
       [art_q.gif] Would or do you write antivirus software?
       [art_a.gif] No I wouldn't. I couldn't make money outta it anyways
       and just writing one for fun is a waste with my ever decreasing
       amount of spare time.
       I have though written cleaners against viruses reported in the
       wild. It's for no use to have a product detecting 10.000 viruses
       which aren't a real treat.
       [art_q.gif] If so, what kind of software has your main interest?
       [art_a.gif] TSR-blockers, scanners & cleaners.
       [art_q.gif] What would you like to say to antivirus persons if you
       have the chance?
       [art_a.gif] "Hello". Which is a good first word to start a
       conversation with.
       [art_q.gif] What would you like to say to new virus writers that
       are getting in the scene?
       [art_a.gif] It's not really worth it and maybe it's only a waste of
       time for everyone. In the end nothing what you are doing now
       counts. Find something better to do and get on with your life
       without the scene. It won't do shit for you.
       [art_q.gif] What are you planning to do in the future with the
       knowledge you have now about viruses?
       [art_a.gif] Frankly said I don't quite know. I had use for the
       knowledge gained from the scene and from friends in the scene.
       However I would like to believe that you have use for anything you
       ever learn, so it's not really such a big deal afterall.
       I'm as for the moment writing an article about what good
       side-effects viruswriting may have (on personal basis), but as for
       anything concerning the future, you just don't know.
       [art_q.gif] Do you think that writing viruses was a good descision
       for you to take? Please motivate why Yes or No.
       [art_a.gif] I wouldn't know. I could impossible know what would or
       could have happend if I didn't. I only know my situation as for
       now, but sure I like my current life.
       PS: This interview will be put in a dutch antivirus book.

   [art_separ.gif]

   [art_drops2.gif]      AV interview
   Here comes an interview with Sarah Gordon (all you surely know her).
       She can be reached at on sarah@wildlist.org. Here it follows
       anyways, enjoy!
       [art_q.gif] First of all, i would like you to give me a personal
       character presentation about yourself with your own words. then,
       secondly, (be honest), i would you to write how you think other
       people around you, see you as.
       [art_a.gif] Personally, i try just to be honest, thorough,
       compassionate, and loving person. i try to not make judgements or
       draw conclusions without thinking them through, and i try to be
       fair. (note: i did not say i dont make judgements or draw
       conclusions. i said i try to think them thru and be fair. i see
       nothing wrong with a person saying 'i like or dont like this or
       that and here is why', or 'this or that is wrong, here is why'. i
       am not very good 'game player', and usually just say what i think.
       since sometimes what i think may change, this can be a problem :)
       my priorities in my personal life are relationship to God, to my
       husband (i was recently married as you may know), to my children
       (who are grown), to my friends, and then to my work. at least, in
       theory this is the case. how i see myself?..hmm, well, i try to
       adhere to what i think is important, but i do not always succeed.
       how others see me, well, you would have to ask them :). but i think
       sometimes some people have pre-conceived ideas, or want someone to
       fit a certain mold they are comfortable with....so they put me
       there. when they do actually take the time to know me, they often
       find out they were wrong. i think also this happens with many
       people, not just me. (it could be they find out they were right :)
       yet others, usually those who are professionally competent and
       secure, don't have these problems -- they see the bigger picture
       and have no need to create artificial life-model of another person
       :) (no pun intended).
       i am told that i have no sense of humour and that i see things
       'differently', whether or not this is a benefit is an exercise left
       to the reader.
       [art_q.gif] about your articles, what gives you motivation to write
       them?
       [art_a.gif] well, i write different kinds of articles, and the
       motivation is different for different ones, at different times.
       i write about something if it interests me, and if i think i may
       have some idea someone else may not have thought of. or if i see
       something written i dont agree with.
       i have written several for money, but they are usually technical
       security articles, nothing to do with viruses or virus writers, or
       any of that. sometimes it is nice to deal with 'non-people' issues,
       there is a lot less room for 'controversy' :)
       [art_q.gif] and/or the virus-community with your write-ups? (if
       yes, motivate what.. ).
       [art_a.gif] sure, some have changed. i mean, now they are talking
       to each other instead of just name calling. i think i played some
       role in that. well, i know i played some role in that. but my
       'role' was just to initiate change, as some form of catylst. don't
       you know, usually the catalyst gets burned the most :)
       there is now more examination of facts, instead of hype and
       hysteria, related to virus writers. i know i played some role in
       that. all in all this examination is good, for both sides of the
       discussion.
       i think virus writers are now thinking and talking more about what
       they are doing and want to do, and realising the impacts of
       releasing their creations. im told i have had some role in that.
       but i dont know. i hope i did. but it could be natural sequence of
       events. maybe i just recorded/documented it. maybe i made some
       change by doing that...i don't know. i know personally i have had
       some impact in the overall dynamic, but how much and how to measure
       is difficult.
       many times now im quoted about what ive learned by just talking to
       people and analysing facts about how viruses really spread.
       hopefully this has some effect on getting the media to focus on
       real problems.
       but virus writers and things related to them are just small portion
       of my work. ive done more in product testing, certification and
       network security. however, it is the 'virus writer' work which
       seems to grab some attention.
       [art_q.gif] something you have written/worked about that has been
       misunderstood?
       [art_a.gif] sure, this is always the case with everyone isnt it?
       havent you? :)
       in particular, i remember when phrack wrote some story which they
       later said 'we're sorry, we didnt check this out thoroughly' about
       my trying to shut down some bbs. its true i was in a room when
       someone suggested that some bbs should be closed, but if i remember
       correctly, i suggested this is not a very good idea...
       then, there was that ugly silliness the virus writer kohntark made
       up. i never did figure out why he did that, but he seemed to have
       some stuff works, just like it is cool to know about other computer
       actions and who can argue with you? not me. but there is no 'magic'
       or technological 'excellence' in this stuff. its not 'new science'.
       its not any way to get a good job. what it can be is some very
       costly pasttime. there can be a big price to pay -- you can really
       hurt someone with the viruses, because you can not guarantee that
       you can control the viruses.
       people will say you cant *really* hurt anyone, but they are wrong.
       so please stop and think what you are doing. if you are the kind of
       guy who wants to hurt them, then you deserve what you may get if
       you do it.
       [how many words was that?]
       [art_q.gif] about your article "the generic viruswriter", the four
       persons you selected for the four groups, who were they? (if you
       can't give this out, don't, but motivate why.. ).
       [art_a.gif] sorry but that is confidential to them. why? i told
       them it will be confidential unless they tell me otherwise when i
       asked for people to respond to the survey.
       [art_q.gif] which virus-related article is your personal favorite?
       (why is that..).
       [art_a.gif] general systems theoretical model for av protection (if
       you mean my own). it is favorite because it allowed me to work in
       new area. or do you mean in general?
       [art_q.gif] what, concerning virus-related stuff have you regretted
       in your life?
       [art_a.gif] i regret that i did not realise the personal dynamics
       of my relationship with the virus writer formerly known as dark
       avenger, and that i was sometimes too concerned with my personal
       life to give attention to him when he needed it. but it was really
       wearing me out, and i actually got physically ill from spending too
       much time with all the work. i did not realise the impact this all
       would have on him, or on me. it took alot of my time and attention
       for several years.
       i have written a lot about how we dont realise the impact of our
       actions on others, since the computers can tend to desensitize us.
       unfortunately, i was not 'immune' to this .
       [art_q.gif] do you prefer tea or coffee in the morning?
       [art_a.gif] grape kool-aid (dont you attend defcon? :)
       [art_q.gif] your favorite dish?
       [art_a.gif] prawn crackers, any hot chinese dish with chicken.
       [art_q.gif] what're your hobbies? (umm.. one hobby.. many
       hobbies??).
       [art_a.gif] hobbies? i think you need spare time to have those.. i
       used to sail and did at one time train and ride my own horse, but i
       had to give him away when i could not afford to keep him. i also
       dont have my sunfish sailboat anymore. i have recently tried to do
       some oil painting, but lost interest in it. i guess i dont really
       have any hobbies.
       do you?
       [art_q.gif] who did you vote for in the president election - 96?
       [art_a.gif] i did not vote.
       [art_q.gif] do you think the "virus-infections-problems" will die
       out and fade away with the OSes getting more common, dos losing
       ground, etc? and in how long time if yes..
       [art_a.gif] i think this depends on how you define 'problems' :)
       [art_q.gif] you sell f-prot professional, what other av-products
       would you recommend for the average user?
       [art_a.gif] the 'best' product for any job depends on the needs of
       the user as well as the product. any product which is wildlist
       compliant is a good 'starting place' for the user. from there, he
       will need to factor in his individual needs.
       [art_q.gif] about f-prot pro & not-registrated, what are the
       differences?
       [art_a.gif] i have did a comparison for the Command web site...you
       can see the differences there! (can you tell i'm getting tired? :)
       [art_q.gif] how does your typical monday-friday day look like? (are
       you satisfied with your current life?).
       [art_a.gif] get up. drink kool-aid. (ok, coffee:). log-on while
       drinking coffee. answer mail. answer questions about viruses :).
       answer more questions about viruses :). (answer this mail). look at
       viruses :). look at more viruses :). try to spend some time
       researching new topics. answer more questions about and look at
       more viruses (usually macro viruses).
       am i satisfied? no. are you?
       [art_q.gif] what plans (irl/computer) do you have for the future?
       [art_a.gif] irl, i want to buy a house and a dog :) have a garden
       and volunteer some time someplace meaningful.
       for computer, i am thinking maybe ill write some new software,
       maybe automate some tests which take a lot of my time now, and
       probably design a new CSecurity model.
       [art_q.gif] do you prefer a dog or a cat? (not for dinner.. pet
       :)).
       [art_a.gif] hey, how did you guess? i have a cat but he lives with
       my friend. i could not bring him to florida. he loved his house too
       much. so now i dont have any pet. but hope to have both.
       well ..since i wrote this, i have bought another dog, he is not yet
       named, and is still at the pet store ..but i will be bringing him
       home soon.
       [since i wrote this (yet another edit :)), the dog from the pet
       store got sick. so we got yet another dog. our third. this one we
       named 'lucky'. i hope he is :)]
       [art_q.gif] about viruswriting groups, a lot of us has faded out
       and died recently, anything you want to say to them or to the one's
       that still remains?
       [art_a.gif] i'd be interested to talk to anyone who wants to talk
       seriously about viruses.
       [art_q.gif] do you consider viruswriting to be a perverted hobby?
       [art_a.gif] never did. waste of time. probably unethical from a
       formalised ethical modeling point of view (if you're Kantian :).
       can be illegal. but perverted? thats funny :) . have you seen the
       Internet lately?
       lets keep things in perspective. i work hard to help users avoid
       problems from viruses, and feel people need to take active steps to
       help stop virus distribution. im against indiscriminate virus
       distribution, and think that as a society we should not overtly or
       tacitly condone it.
       but there are far worse problems facing our society. this is not to
       say viruses are 'no problem'. they sure are! but in the 'big
       picture' there are far worse problems facing computer users and
       society in general than the viruses we are seeing today.
       it is the viruses which i have chosen to fight, and i wont stop
       fighting against them because it is wrong to make software which
       hurts people or which has the potential to hurt people. computers
       should be used for helping people, used for good ethical purposes.
       now, can you and i talk about why you write viruses and distribute
       them in your magazine? because i think it is wrong. you can argue
       that what people decide to do with them is their own business and
       not your fault, but actually if you didnt give them the viruses,
       you wouldnt have a role in their using them for bad.
       as it stands now, you are partly responsible for what they do with
       what they do with your creation. why not create something which
       uses the computer to help people, something they can chose to use
       and thank you for instead?

   [art_drops2.gif]      IRL papers
   I've seen a lot of write-up's concerning computer-viruses lately but
       since they're all in swedish and me being a bad translator I'm
       sorry I didn't translate them all for you.
       If you know some swedish though the page to be on is:
       http://www.qainfo.se/artiklar_om_virus.htm (or .html dunno).
       One article called "Virus Buster" is located on
       http://www.idg.se/cs/artiklar/1996/77/cspe/b10a/b10a.htm (or .html
       dunno) which's featuring a picture of Klas (S&S Sweden) Sch�ldstr�m
       "which makes life hard for those who got the idea to create and
       distribute computer viruses" (He's defintitly geeky looking, check
       for yourself!).

   [art_separ.gif]

       Some quote's from that articles (published in Computer Sweden #77,
       Friday the 6 of Dec, 1996) follow though (scene-person related, go
       bitch on him or so..) here.
       "Last spring, the virus Boza came, that was the first virus for
       Win/95. But it sucked. It can only infect files in the same
       directory from where it was executed from and it fails doing it
       sometimes. It was though a media-hype (or PR-trick) from the
       virus-authors to be first with a 32-bits-virus".
       (Now, he also diss the hare virus claiming it's only halts the
       computer and that he consider macro-viruses the real danger..).

   [art_separ.gif]

       Furthermore, they write (which could be interesting in this zine
       ;)).
       "Klas consider a virus named One-Half to be among the most naughty
       one's he's ever seen. - At the occations I've seen a virus spread
       itself to many computers at one time, it's one-half, he says. "It's
       made hard to detect and has no bugs. It places itself on the
       "partition-sector" (direct-translation -tu) and slowly starts to
       encrypt the harddrive. When half of the hd is encrypted the message
       "Dis is one half. Press any key to continue" is displayed and at
       that time, also back-up's is encrypted.

   [art_drops2.gif]      Horror
   Since I forgot to include this code in the VLAD april fool's edition,
       here follow [Push-Up] (v. early beta!) written ages and ages ago by
       someone who surely indeed will turn red-hot-chily-red when seeing
       this ;).
       The code is as unoptimized as can be ;) and there are labels and
       check's w/o corresponding code :-). Double-code inclusion is
       included for your own sake! You -should- be able to optimize this
       and feel like an asm-wiz!
       As shitty old tradition we supply you with un-finished viruses for
       you to modify and claim your very own creation!

   [art_separ.gif]

       Also, as we say in Sweden "a laugh extends your life", so... I
       guess you'll be like really old after looking closely into this
       one.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Anyways the basic thought for this virus was good since I consider
       a bs/mbr/com/exe semi-stealth virus an alright replicator. The
       virus should work, but I guess that's about it, probably not
       perfectly under all configurations and stuff.

   [art_separ.gif]

   [art_drops2.gif]      Gimme more cheese please
   This virus is *really really* old and is for me hysterical funny to
       look on. If the author of it who wrote it 93/1994 remembers it,
       please write me an email! (I hope/think/believe you don't mind it
       being included here ;)).
       It lack some byte optimizing but the overall quality is though
       alright concerning the coding style. (Now, I can nag on this, when
       I recieved it I didn't understand anything and the author teased me
       like shit ;)).
       Well, it's a resident COM infector w/o any other functions or
       payloads, works really good on my machine.

   [art_drops2.gif]      Eugene K
   Well, I'm a big fan of AVP and its grafical section of viruses so here
       follow a gfx payload which is a sort of "remake" of a fire effect.
       Finally Eugene did include (what he called) "Riot.ir8" (a virus
       with a gfx effect) and just to see if he will include the virus
       below too. The virus follow as hex-script below this very slow
       effect named GrayNuclearSky. Don't enjoy.

   [art_drops2.gif]      The LifeWire virus
   About a 220 byte .exe overwriter ;) of EXE-files which F-prot doesn't
       detect due to unknown reasons. It has two activation routines, one
       grafical and one standard which itself claim to have some
       self-modifying-code along with some nifty TSR routine. Of course
       that routine is a damn liar. The first one will blow the second of
       november any year from 1997 (RTM Worm day). The second one will 'go
       off' on random basis. This virus wasn't ment to be a serious virus,
       simple a demo-virus (haha) for the demo-routine above. Further more
       the text-strings
"[LiveWire GFX] "
"Hiya, Robert.. !"
       is visible in trojanized files.

   [art_drops2.gif]      Side-effects the conversation way
   This was suppose to be a short summery of what good side effects
       viruswriting might have. I can't exactly say what you consider
       being a positive effect of something, but most stuff thought of is
       negative which of course leads us to a position where it's hard to
       motivate viruswriting. This mean that this is an important issue to
       deal with if some of your irl 'friends' all sudden start wondering
       why the fuck you're doing it and you have'll to defend your rights.

   [art_separ.gif]

       Well, you probably have thought about a few good reasons yourself,
       if you need reasons that is. I said I couldnt give any good reasons
       to viruswriting stated in the interview published above ;).. Hm,
       that is definitly to simplify it, but it's for a time a fun thing
       to do.
       [art_q.gif] Fun? Is it fun to write something with evil intension?
       Is it fun to make a bomb?
       [art_a.gif] Well, bombs are interesting, but please don't compare
       those things. When I said "fun", I ment "interesting". Yes, it is
       interesting to program things. It's interesting to develop code
       with an unique capability - to self-replicate. It's interesting to
       meet other people similar yourself and it's interesting and fun to
       see other people solution and learn from them. The coding itself is
       just a must to be accepted by the people who I talk with.
       [art_q.gif] But why viruses?
       [art_a.gif] Well, do you find any other programs that has the same
       impact on users than viruses? It's fun to know much about something
       that not too many people know much about.
       [art_q.gif] So.. it's all about having respect then?
       [art_a.gif] No, it's not. I won't discuss this with most people,
       only with those who're concerned. Plus, I like having knowledge if
       some smartass need to be "taken care of", but since I dislike
       physical violence, I find my computer skills somewhat useful.
       [art_q.gif] So, then you distribute your code to people you
       dislike?
       [art_a.gif] No. I didn't say you did now did I?
       Defence is easy. Just bore them to death and voila, you'll win. The
       conversation above *was* boring and due to that, I won't write
       anymore on it. The conversation above wasn't about side-effects at
       all. Gotcha. As stated somewhere, stay tuned and it will be
       presented. Not here though. Ha-Ha.

   [art_drops2.gif]      Scene-Zines.
   Recently, I've seen a lot of zines/groups popping up and while some has
       faded away. Well, some say the scene is dying but I think not. Only
       the "good old virus groups" are. Rabid is dead (hehe!), P/S is,
       NuKE is RIP, YAM, TridenT, DY, VG and so on are (Not much of news,
       most people don't even know about some jam ;)) but! there's
       'always' new groups coming up some who're really good.. and yea..
       Immortal Riot is still around and will be for quite some time..
       Don't expect a fade out!

   [art_separ.gif]

       The funny thing with virus-groups is that we do release a shitload
       of zines. A short summary of the scene-zines might be in order here
       (If I've forgotten one or two.. that is only because I'm tired, but
       since I dislike to sleep... deal with it)
       40hex
       What I heard P/S died and won't put out any more 40hex issues.
       Well, most 40hex zines did include things one still can look on and
       learn from so if you miss them, re-read and study an old one :).
       VLAD
       It's sad Qark and Quantum gave the entire virus-thing up, but we'll
       see what Darkman (who have been outta it recently) can do with it.
       I miss them ;) seeing my name appear in the greetings to each issue
       (hehe!) and those games included. After metabolis gave up vlad they
       lost a little of their "personality". Qark was very good as
       organiser, too bad (for us) he got tired of it and desided to drop
       the entire thing. Good luck in life guys!
       INSANE REALITY:
       After our merge with Genesis we finally brought out an issue and in
       my opinion a very interesting issue, too. Beside the overall
       code-quality (maybe too high for most) it included a lot of other
       good non-coding material. Thanks are due to Dark Fiber for doing a
       lot of work for us!
       Also worth to mention is that Sepultura and Rajaat put a lot of
       effort in doing it as good as possible. I heard people complained
       and gave us negative feedback, yet I can't understand why.
       There isn't much news in IRG (what I know of anyways) issue#9 is
       under development and you can if you consider yourself worthy
       contribute to it. Expect to see a high quality issue!
       29#A
       Vlad-stylish group from Spain(?) I wish good luck in the future.
       Had some interesting things in issue #1 and we can always hope it
       remains stable and evolve.
       Computa-Gangsta
       Issue #1 isn't really worth bitching on here. But, it's a first
       issue and I won't bitch on newcomers. We all started somewhere...
       STEALTH.
       Does contain a lot of complex & interesting stuff. Maybe better
       commented viruses would increase the "overall quality" though. From
       russia with love :).
       PLASMA
       DC is gone. Might have formed another group called RSA. Can be
       interesting to see what Wild Worker and co. can do with his crew
       (RSA). (I know he wasn't "pres" but he should be).
       SVL
       Good luck guys! I surely will enjoy reading this zine! It's quality
       (besides this article!) poeple expect from you. Hope there will be
       a issue #2!
       Actually, this zine is not a SVL's one, moreover, it is not a group
       mag at all. Aditionally, we would like to stay an intergroup zine
       :) ]
       NuKE
       Has been dead for several years now, still there is some newbee's
       on irc asking for VCL2. Don't do that, it's annoying as hell and
       you'll most likely be kicked or banned two seconds after you
       pressed enter. So read my lips: NuKE is dead!
       iKX
       Seems to be an interesting group, including b0z0 and guys. They did
       contribute to Insane Reality #8 and Sailor Moon is an interesting
       virus.
       Minotaurus
       Dunno if the spelling is correct or not ;). They should though
       write their stuff in english if they're around (haven't seen much
       lately though).

   [art_separ.gif]

       So.. there's actually a shitload of groups out there, producing
       code. Hang around long enough on irc #virus and you'll see them
       sometime.

   [art_drops2.gif]      Greets
   There's so many people to greet really. I would like to thank everyone
       who have been there for me, on the irc, on email and on the phone.
       Further greets goes to anyone who won't take this contribution any
       seriously. I promised to include something and I try to keep my
       promises. ok?
       Thanks to all I ever have done a /msg to, and yea.. IRG guys.. keep
       it up!

   [art_drops2.gif]      Quotation & Poetry
   Just read my mind and find the complete guide to insanity. Should be
       trivial if you belong to the second foundation. Personally I dunno
       about what choice I would made. First, Second or Gaia.. Hm, tricky.
       But.. who really want to make choices. That sucks. I just want it
       all :).

   [art_drops2.gif]      Future
   I will continue hanging on the irc, writing my stupid articles and just
       float around being what I've been. Really, I'm so satisfied what
       Sepultura has done for IRG so consider him in control. If you found
       this article chaotic. You're right that was the idea if I might add
       that. For IRG, the future is as bright as always.
