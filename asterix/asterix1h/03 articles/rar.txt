       Hi guys.
       I decided to update Quark's ARJ Dropper for RAR dropping. I think
       what archive infection have feature at every OS, so i want to
       include ZIP and LHA dropping to nex relase of *-Zine. What this
       code does and what no.

       At first it check if is today some day fo August. On this "some"
       day it launches my payload.
       Else it goes to infection. At second it find first ARJ for
       infection. If it find some then it try to infect it. if archive is
       infected now it is looking for next one ARJ. If is doesnot find any
       ARJ for infection ti try infect RAR files. RAR file can't be
       MULTIVOLUME ( at next relase it can be.) , can't be LOCKED and in
       archive can't be present AUTENTYCITY informations. RAR infection is
       verry simply. Go to eof write header, write yourself and infection
       is done.
