   [intwho.gif]    Interview with CoKe of VLAD

   People, this interwiew is the only online interview in this issue. In
   all other cases
   i send to the ppl questions and just waited for the reply. If this
   interview sounds
   rather strange, nevermind, apologize it, I interviewed _CoKe_ in very
   unhealthy
   time. If I remember, it was about 6.30 am when we started. And in such
   a time,
   every normal european programmer sleeps... For some 1 or two hours...

                               [intsepar.gif]

   [intq.gif] Coke, try to introduce yourselves ....
   [inta.gif] Hehe.. Well My handle is CoKe, comes from Coca Cola, not
   from cocaine.. :) It's my first and only handle. Good enough ? :)
   [intq.gif] So, the next question, really difficult one: When did you
   start to do somethin' with computerz?
   [inta.gif] Phew.. I was 10 or so when I got my first PC.. 8088 XT with
   Hercules graphics card... Since most of the games were CGA only I
   started to code in BasicA and GwBasic to write my own games... :) That
   makes 13 years now
   [intq.gif] The coder was born.... but, in my humble opinion, the gamez
   and virii 're kinda different,or am I not right?
   [inta.gif] Of course. But I wrote my first "virus" in QuickBasic 4.0
   some years later... On execution it got the current EXE name from
   commandline, did a shell "dir >file.txt", opened that, and overwrote
   the EXE's in current directory with a copy of itself..heh
   [intq.gif] Soundz like good start, but to go resident in HLL is right
   difficult task. So you have to switch to the right language - to the
   assembler...
   [inta.gif] Yeah.. I was too limited in Basic, so after a while, I
   switched to C... And to make some small routines faster, I used a bit
   of assembler to speed things up...
   [intq.gif] So your destiny was about become assebler xpert and viruz
   coderz after all the switching ....
   [inta.gif] Yeah... I always found viruses quite fascinating..
   Biological AND computer viruses.. So I grabbed some interrupt list (Not
   Ralphies), TASM, and started writing a non-ow com infector.. That
   actually took me 2 weeks of non-stop (night)work.. Another week later,
   I wrote a reï¿½ mover for it, since my friends playing and copying
   everything from my system got all infected.. hehe
   [intq.gif] I know that situation. Non-ow com infectorz are good start
   for a coder, but you didn't stop at this level of code i know... And
   that nice story with remover ... Didn't you think of launching some
   kind of AV biz ?
   [inta.gif] My first EXE infector was months later.. I first had to get
   Internet.. There I found an IR mag, called up their HQ, and got in
   touch with The Unforgiven and Metal Militia.. So I got more and more
   info, and got into work for my first EXE infector.. :) At that time I
   sent all my sources to Metal Militia, to discuss them over.. He was an
   idol at that time.. I thought about becoming AV for a time, but quickly
   realized that the AV was a commercial thingy, and directed by a few
   ppl. So I dropped the idea again... Especially after I got in touch
   with qark
   [intq.gif] Qark is (was?) really very productive coder, and of course,
   VLAD member. And to code alone, without beeing in any group is not such
   a big fun....
   [inta.gif] Exactly.. >From the IR HQ I polled NukeNet, and posted some
   mails there... One day I had an email from qark inviting me to visit
   #virus, which I did.. He immediately put me on the Bot (LamerBot)... I
   coded some more stuff, and I gave one of them to VLAD because I wanted
   to join.. The votes were in my favour... fortunately.. :) hehe.. The
   funny thing is that the virus I gave them was buggy... But that's an
   old VLAD tradition.. hehe
   [intc.gif] [...I always use to say "It is not actually bug, but only
   some minor compactibility problem with hardware... :)"...]
   [intq.gif] So you landed in VLAD. How was the feeling of beeing member
   of such elite bunch of geekz
   [inta.gif] I was VERY surprised... Because I became a VLAD member some
   weeks after I applied for IR membership.. I got refused because I was
   non-Swede (No kiddin').. That depressed me alot.. :) Becoming a VLAD
   member was something I didn't even dare to dream about.. :) I remember
   the day when votes were finished, and Metabolis said on #virus : "CoKe
   is now a VLAD member"... Guess that was one of my happiest days.. :)
   [intq.gif] And can you say, why is the true reason of vlad's dead ?
   [inta.gif] First of all VLAD is _NOT_ dead...
   [intq.gif] ??? all the people 're saying "VLAD is dead and issue #7 was
   goodbye issue...
   [inta.gif] That's not correct. There will be a VLAD #8... 100%...
   [intq.gif] That means ....???
   [inta.gif] Well it means there will be a VLAD #8... :)
   [intq.gif] And who is continuing in the tradition ?
   [inta.gif] Darkman, me and [XXX] heheh... Qark and Quantum left VLAD
   because they were in the biz for too long I guess... hey both did a
   remarkable work, so I guess they earned that pause. :-)
   [intq.gif] Let's back to the main topic, the viruses. What's your best
   virus, what's your most favourite virus ... And what virus ,in your
   opinion, was somewhat innovative in the last time ?
   [inta.gif] I like all my viruses, and have absolutely no favourites..
   Each virus is a mirror of my knowledge at that time, so I like them
   all.. I think my most innovative is Obscurum which is a COM/EXE
   stealth/res/poly that has got some neat tricks to hide..
   [intq.gif] And some really good viruses by other authorz ?
   [inta.gif] I think the most impressive virus of all time is BIZATCH,
   not because it was done by a fellow VLAD member.. Bizatch kicked Bill's
   ass.. :)
   [intq.gif] I agree, but all the AV humbug about naming it Boza was
   really disgusting.
   [inta.gif] Yes. I still don't quite understand why that shit..
   Probabaly some kinda revenge.. A really LOW level revenge..
   [intq.gif] BIZATCH has shown, that W95 is piece of shit, but actually,
   we all knew it for a long time. So now i wolud like to ask you about
   your planz for the future. As coder and of cos also in general... new
   OSes, new viruses, new trendz ...
   [inta.gif] Yes.. I loved OS/2, but due to a lack of software, I almost
   HAD to switch to WIN95, just like thousands of other users... I hate
   Bill for that.. OS/2 was much better, and WIN95 only made it because of
   a HUGE publicity work by Mickeysoft.. My future.. Oh my... I'll do more
   viruses, and we'll try to get VLAD up again.. :)
   [intq.gif] Microsoft, how can be something good, if it is produced by
   someone with small and not hard (e.g dick :)... btw, we have here such
   a club - M$-haterz and ALT-F4 club
   [inta.gif] I like that ALT-F4 club.. hehe where can I join ? :)
   [intq.gif] Would you like to contribute to greetingz section and to
   fuck you section ?
   [inta.gif] Greetings to Qark, Metabolis, MMIR, TUIR, Blonde/IR and
   Skeeve. Fuck them go to : All the lame irc-warriors.. Oh yeah .. and
   greetings to Sokrates aswell.. :)
   [intq.gif] Okay , wish you good luck and good in yuor work.
   [inta.gif] Thanks.. :) And don't forget.. VLAD is not dead... :) I'd be
   grateful if you could email your mag to me..
