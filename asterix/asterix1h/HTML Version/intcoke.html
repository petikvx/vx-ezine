<br>
People, this interwiew is the only online interview in this issue. In all other cases<br>
i send to the ppl questions and just waited for the reply. If this interview sounds<br>
rather strange, nevermind, apologize it, I interviewed _CoKe_ in very unhealthy<br>
time. If I remember, it was about 6.30 am when we started. And in such a time,<br>
every normal european programmer sleeps... For some 1 or two hours...

cocaine.. :) It's my first and only handle. Good enough ? :)<br><br></td>

do somethin' with computerz?</td>

<td width=98% valign=top><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Phew.. I was 10  or so when I got my first  PC.. 8088 XT with Hercules
graphics card...  Since most of the  games were CGA only  I started to
code in BasicA  and GwBasic to write my own  games... :) That makes 13
years now<br><br></td>

virii 're kinda different,or am I not right?</td>

<td width=2% valign=top halign=right><img src=gfx/inta.gif></td>
<td width=98% valign=top><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Of course. But  I wrote my first "virus" in  QuickBasic 4.0 some years
later... On  execution it got  the current EXE  name from commandline,
did a shell  "dir >file.txt", opened that, and  overwrote the EXE's in
current directory with a copy of itself..heh<br><br></td>

<td width=2% valign=top halign=right><img src=gfx/intq.gif></td>
<td width=98% valign=top><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> Soundz  like  good  start,  but  to  go  resident  in HLL is right
difficult task. So  you have to switch to the  right language - to the
assembler...</td>
</tr><tr>
<td width=2% valign=top halign=right><img src=gfx/inta.gif></td>
<td width=98% valign=top><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yeah.. I  was too limited  in Basic, so  after a while,  I switched to C... And to make
some small routines faster, I used a bit of assembler to speed things up...<br><br></td>

after all the switching ....</td>

<td width=2% valign=top halign=right><img src=gfx/inta.gif></td>
<td width=98% valign=top><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Yeah...  I always  found  viruses  quite fascinating..  Biological AND
computer viruses..  So I grabbed  some interrupt list  (Not Ralphies),
TASM, and started  writing a non-ow com infector..  That actually took
me 2 weeks of non-stop (night)work.. Another week later, I wrote a re­
mover for it, since my friends  playing and copying everything from my
system got all infected.. hehe<br><br></td>

<tr>
<td width=2% valign=top halign=right><img src=gfx/intq.gif></td>
<td width=98% valign=top><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I know  that situation.  Non-ow com  infectorz are  good start for
a coder, but you didn't stop at this  level of code i know... And that
nice story with remover ... Didn't you think of launching some kind of
AV biz ?</td>

<td width=2% valign=top halign=right><img src=gfx/inta.gif></td>
<td width=98% valign=top><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My first EXE infector was months later.. I first had to get Internet..
There I found an IR mag, called up their HQ, and got in touch with The
Unforgiven and  Metal Militia.. So I  got more and more  info, and got
into work for  my first EXE infector.. :)  At that time I sent  all my
sources to Metal Militia, to discuss them over.. He was an idol at that
time.. I  thought about becoming AV  for a time, but  quickly realized
that the  AV was a  commercial thingy, and  directed by a  few ppl. So
I dropped the idea again... Especially after I got in touch with qark<br><br></td>

<td width=98% valign=top><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Exactly..  >From the  IR HQ  I polled  NukeNet, and  posted some  mails
there... One day I had an email from qark inviting me to visit #virus,
which I did..  He immediately put me on the  Bot (LamerBot)... I coded
some more stuff,  and I gave one of  them to VLAD because I  wanted to
join..  The votes  were in  my favour...  fortunately.. :)  hehe.. The
funny thing is  that the virus I gave them  was buggy... But that's an
old VLAD tradition.. hehe<br><br></td>

<td width=98% valign=top><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I was  VERY surprised...  Because I  became a  VLAD member  some weeks
after  I applied  for IR  membership..  I  got refused  because I  was
non-Swede (No kiddin')..  That depressed me alot.. :)  Becoming a VLAD
member was something I didn't even dare to dream about.. :) I remember
the day when votes were finished, and Metabolis said on #virus : "CoKe
is now a VLAD member"... Guess that was one of my happiest days.. :)<br><br></td>

new viruses, new trendz ...</td>

switch to WIN95, just like thousands of other users... I hate Bill for
that.. OS/2 was much better, and WIN95  only made it because of a HUGE
publicity work by Mickeysoft..
My future.. Oh  my... I'll do more viruses, and  we'll try to get VLAD
up again.. :)<br><br></td>
