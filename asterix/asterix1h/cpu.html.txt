       Hi dudez! Here I present to the community result of my work.
       Basically, this tables are based on opcodes.lst from Ralph's list.
       All I did is just their transcription to this form. As it took quit
       a long time, I hope you will use it and enjoy it.

Just a marginal notice from 1999 position - the table i prepared in 1997
has unfortunately some minor bugs. Some other ppl took over the table and didn't
notice it exactly as i didn't .... So is the life ... :)))))
