    þ  Catalogs and sorts through your viruses, even ones inside
       PKzip files WITHOUT UNZIPPING THEM.

    þ  Handles up to 16,000 virus files!

    þ  Recurse subdirectories - hunt down your Data file/Config
       file in your path

    þ  Extracts virus names from F-PROT/AVPRO/TBAV reports and
       imports them into the database, automatically!

    þ  Stores NAME, file size, file date, CRC, Virus name, plus
       the PKZIP file containing the file (if any)
       No more rediculous Crc-only databases

    þ  Catalogs .TD0 .ASM .A86 .C* .OBJ .EXE .COM .VXE .VOM
       .SYS .BO? .PAS  -  not just executable files

    þ  Allows comparing two virus collections and generating
       a report on what you DO NOT have.

    ============* INTRODUCTION *=====================================

Virus collecting is well and active around the world, and many people
have several hundred, maybe even thousands on their computer.  The
problem is that no real programs are available for virus collectors.

Sure, there is TBweeder (Frans Veldman) which is an "in house" sorter
for ThunderByte Anti-Virus.  However, it only stores CRC values (and
names, but in a separate file.. ICK!) and cannot do complex functions
on your virus collection.  Wouldn't it be nice to "export" data concerning
your virus files into a database program, sort/search for things based
upon a user-definable field, compare YOUR database against other people's
to see what you don't have, etc?

            Along comes VIRUS COLLECTOR'S TOOLBOX.

If you have more than 10 viruses, then you might have some duplicates.
And finding them is a BIG chore, especially when you have more than 1,000
in your collection.  I personally am a "collection" trader.

I give people my collection in trade for theirs (if they have anything
interesting).  This allows a more rapid growth of my collection (rather
than downloading every one from BBS's, etc...) and talking to interesting
people along the way.

VIRUS COLLECTOR'S TOOLBOX is freeware and can be distributed without
cost.  Please do not trojanize the program and spread it around.
Virus collecting and being a decent human being are not mutually exclusive.








   ================* ETHICS *=====================================

I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology, am a professional programmer
for a major Bank, have a second-degree black belt in the martial arts,
have a wife and kids, run an Anti-Virus bulletin board, plus am an
"authorized distributor" of a major Anti-Virus program.

Obviously, I am not a virus-writing jerk, out to destroy the world,
nor do I have ANY PART in the rediculous political arena that currently
clouds the Anti-Virus/Virus-writing field.  As a matter of fact, both
parties probably dislike me  :-)

I *DO* have a large collection - over 6,400+ virus files and source code
that I *DO NOT* give out to anyone except other collectors.  After all,
if some guy already has over 500+ viruses, what does sharing 200 more hurt?

I also DO NOT hand out viruses to kids, upload them to bulletin boards
for fun, or trash my neighbor's computers with them.  That's just plain
dumb (plus a federal offense).  I DO enjoy gathering a collection, and
researching the various aspects of viruses from time to time.

(Similar to Baseball trading cards, comic books, coins, etc...)









                USAGE:   VDATA [option] [filespec]



  Vdata does not accept pathnames.  Place it in your path, then change
             to the directory containing your files!







  VDATA /ADD [path\filespec]       Adds files (including inside PKZIPs)
                                   to VDATA.DAT file

To begin with, use this to add all your viruses into the database.
Your *best bet* is to just leave the virus files inside PKZIPs, then
let THE TOOLBOX catalog them.  Each one will be listed to the screen
as its added, along with the file name/size/CRC.

Files within PKZIPs are only stored if they are: .TD0 .ASM .A86
 .C* .OBJ .EXE .COM .VXE .VOM .SYS .BO? .BIN .PAS  however any file
you specify on the command line will be added, no matter what
the extension.

CAREFUL:  The first VDATA.DAT in your PATH is used.  If one already exists
          in the current directory/your PATH, it is read into memory, and
          will be added to.  Make sure that THIS one is the data file you want.


A sample output looks like:


 !HISTORY.COM    7764       272F05F1

I use my "own" internal PKZIP evaluating routine to peek inside PKZIP
files (Pkzip version 1.1 or 2).

Note the '!' near the end?
That meant the file was a duplicate.  You can look inside DUPLICAT.LOG
for details.

   The format is:

   1. The symbol '!'
   2. The old filename already in the database
   3. The new filename that wasn't added because it duplicated the old one
   4. The file's size
   5. The file's 32-bit CRC
   6. The PKZIP file containing the dupe (if applicable)

THE TOOLBOX also looks in the current directory for SCANNER.LOG, which
can be F-PROT, TBAV or AVPRO logs, and imports any virus descriptions.
You can create a SCANNER.LOG with:


1) F-PROT ->    F-PROT.EXE  [directory]  /REPORT=SCANNER.LOG  /LIST
2) AVPRO  ->    -V.EXE      [directory]  /WA=SCANNER.LOG
3) TBAV   ->    TBSCAN.EXE  [directory]  ba lo ll=4 ln=SCANNER.LOG


As a default, F-PROT descriptions are used.  If you don't want these
imported (it does slow down the program a little), or you use AVPRO
or TBAV, change the value in VDATA.INI.

Also, see the ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄSUBDIR  ??  That means it changed into a
subdirectory.
As a default, THE TOOLBOX recurses subdirectories.  If you do NOT
want recursion, change that value in your VDATA.INI.


      For more information about VDATA.INI, see below...


THE TOOLBOX does *NOT* evaluate Pkzip inside Pkzip files.  If your virus
collection includes embedded PKzip files, just uncompress them before
adding.

   VIRUS092.ZIP
     ³                        <--- This won't work.  Uncompress first
     ÃÄÄ oldvir.zip
     ÃÄÄ newvir.zip
     ÀÄÄ smeg94.zip

   SMEG94.ZIP
     ³                        <--- Perfect.
     ÃÄÄ smeg.com
     ÃÄÄ smeg.asm
     ÀÄÄ virus.bbs


Once you have your database, you're all set to use the other great
features!





==============  WHAT IS THIS BATCH FILE:  DEL_DUPE.BAT?  =================

When he's done adding files, he will create a batch file 
called DEL_DUPE.BAT containing the commands necessary to delete all those
duplicate files.

If the dupe is inside a PKZIP file, he will add:  

        path\PKZIP -d path\file.zip file

and if the dupe is a regular file, he will add:

        DEL path\file

NOTE: The toolbox searches your path for a PKZIP.EXE, and hard codes 
      it into the batch file.  This is to avoid having a virus named
      PKZIP.COM run, accidentally.






  VDATA /COMP [giver] [receiver]   Compares two bases and finds unique files
                                   that the "receiver" does NOT have

Use this to find viruses someone else has that you DON'T have.  Merely
make the two databases, then use this to compare.

  Example:     VDATA /COMP  fred.dat  vdata.dat

So in this example, you want to see which viruses FRED has that you
don't.  Fred will be giving the viruses, and you will be receiving them...

  Example:     VDATA /COMP  biglist.dat  small.dat

BIGLIST has twice as many viruses, so he will be the "giver" and the
smaller collection will be the "receiver".  You can reverse these
and get what the smaller list may have that the "BIGLIST" doesn't.

Unique files are printed to the screen and to a file: YOUNEED.VTA






  VDATA /DESC                      Converts AVPRO/F-PROT log into a 4DOS
                                   compatible DESCRIPT.ION file


This imports a SCANNER.LOG file (F-PROT/AVPRO) and converts it to
DESCRIPT.ION.  A great feature for all your 4DOS users.




  VDATA /MERG [masterdbase] [dbase]

Merges the dbase file into the masterdbase file, sorting duplicates
as it merges.  This is handy when another virus collector give you a
collection, plus their VDATA.DAT file.  You can simply import their
.DAT file without having to re-scan the files.

   Example:  VDATA /MERG MYDATA.DAT HIS.DAT  merges his.dat file
             into your current mydata.dat, sorting dupes.






  VDATA /QSORT        Lists current VDATA.DAT to screen, sorted by
                      Name, Size or CRC.  You can change how they
                      are sorted by changing the value in your VDATA.INI

This lists the contents of your database file: VDATA.DAT to the screen



  VDATA /LIST         Lists current VDATA.DAT to screen

This lists the contents of your database file: VDATA.DAT to the screen



  VDATA /REPORT       Write current VDATA.DAT to report file: VDATA.RES

This writes the contents of your database file: VDATA.DAT to
a report file: VDATA.RES




  VDATA /DBASE        Write current VDATA.DAT to comma-delimited file
                      (which can be imported into Dbase, Excel, Paradox, etc)

Same as above, but exports VDATA.RES as a comma-delimited file.
Simply start up DBASE, PARADOX, etc... and import it.












   =================* VDATA.INI *=====================================

VDATA.INI is the configuration file for VIRUS COLLECTOR'S TOOLBOX
If it's not in your path, defaults will be used.

The following fields are available:


  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Which scanner's log will you use?   F-PROT, AVPRO, TBAV, NONE
  The default is F-PROT

  Note: If you specify a scanner, make sure the output file
        is SCANNER.LOG


    SCANNER = F-PROT
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  If you press a key during processing, does that mean stop
  the program?

  ANY KEY STOPS = YES
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Print information to an output file?
  NOTE: If you say "NO", then some reports don't print

  PRINT TO FILE = YES
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Print information to the screen?  NOTE: I recommend leaving this on...

  PRINT TO SCREEN = YES
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  When doing a /QSORT printout to the screen, how should it
  be sorted?    Default is NAME

  SORT BY = NAME
  SORT BY = SIZE
  SORT BY = CRC
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  When adding files, do you want to process the directories below?
  Default = yes

  RECURSE SUBDIRS = YES
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Create a batch file that deletes duplicates?
  Default = yes

  CREATE BATCH FILE = YES
  ------------------------------------------------------------










   =================* TECHNICAL STUFF *================================

VIRUS COLLECTOR'S TOOLBOX is written in C++, and the VDATA.DAT is
organized as follows:


        struct testrectype {
            long Number;
            char FileName[15];
            long size;
            char date[13];
            long crc;
            char Vname[42];
            char Parent[15];
        } Rec;


        Source code is now included!







   =================* SUPPORT *=====================================

   If you believe this program has been tampered with, you can get a
   fresh new copy:



        INTERNET:    physics@computek.net
        BBS:         Hogard Solutions:  214-641-6292



        This program is freeware, and the author gives ZERO
        technical support.  Enjoy yourself, and I'll be glad
        to trade collections with ya!   :-)
