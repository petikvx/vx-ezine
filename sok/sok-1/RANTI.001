     After seveal discussions with others in this community my original idea
for this mag had to be scrapped for several reasons..  First, the readablity of
the beta issue was for shit.  Second, with a little help the idea of using just
old source code for examples was put to rest.  The old source code was scrapped
for the obivious reason, AV companys do learn - believe it or not -  .  So on
that note, this edition was changed from the spot of #1 to the spot of #.5
kinda a preview so that I can get some feedback from you the reader.. and put
some time into coming up with a clearer idea of what you want to see in source
code..
  Well, this is another damn virus mag for a communtiy already flooded with
mags dedicated to to this sort of thing.  This mag wont do the following, well
maybe it will..

        1.  Introduce atleast 1 original virus per issue.
        2.  Come out at a regular interval. - monthly -
        3.  Provide only assembly source code - the only true virus language -
        4.  Use viruses out of other zines by accident ..
                Don't have the time to make sure it didnt already come out..
            I do try to give credit where credit is due !!
        5.  Provid quality viruses for your entertainment.
                Truth is quality is in the eye of the beholder.
        6.  Ensure that all the viruses have been tested and work.
                My test puter is out so untill then ...
        7.  Provide tools and utils for virus collecting..
        8.  Won't come with a fancy interface or a ton of ANSI pics. blah
                I run OS/2 and vga only mags suck under OS/2
        9.  A variety of viruses ranging in complexity & cuteness..
                COM/EXE - Polymorphic - cute displays etc..

  This source code isn't here for some moron to just assemble and then give to
a friend.  It's being given out in hopes that this may spark some idea in
someones head or give you an example of something you havent been able to get
to work.  So don't change the names then pass them off as your own, as the
virus babybitch from NUKE was a blatent rip of some of meta's [VLAD] work.

  I really dont give a damn if someone doesn't like whats in this issue or any
of the issues that may come out.  If your looking for destructive source code,
you probably wont find it here!  I absolutely hate destructive code, for only
one reason.  When something gets out of your collection, wich happens to us all
eventually, then destructive code is a pain in the butt.  Each edition of this
zine should have a good mix of .com and .exe infectors along with the assorted
combinations of these.  Hopefully some of the viruses picked will have some
uniqe feature wich makes it memorable.

  If your wondering who I am, Ill give you a quick rundown..  I am virus
collector with a small intrest in programing..  One day I found that I had
over 4.5 meg of zipped compilable source code floating around.  So instead of
wasting it I decided to do something with it.. Thus is born a source code
zine..  Not to mention I beleive that a little chaos keeps people from getting
bored and going stagnant..

  This mag is produced by an independent source, or in other words I have no
affiliation with with any virus group that may be out there..  Due to the
fact that I am an independant you should expect to see viruses from just about
everyone with no real prefferance on my end.. If an issue is loaded with virii
from one group or individual then thats just the way I happend to pull them..

And for you knuckle heads who cant figure out where I got the name for this
mag..
                Source as in virus source code
                of
                Kaos for the kaos that a virus creates :)

Most of this source code will assemble with TASM 2.0 or newer, some of it may
require the A86 assembler.  If you dont have an assembler -- Tough --
go out and buy one!
