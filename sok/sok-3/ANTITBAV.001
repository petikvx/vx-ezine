                  The Follies of ThunderByte Anti-Virus
                                   or
                 Rajaat's Revenge from the Great Beyond


  This article started out as just a small note on how to screw up a decent
AV product. (By decent I mean it's not to bad for catching viruses but it sucks
at cleaning them.)  With the passage of time I have come across more and more
material on beating TBAV and TBClean.  This article has now expanded quite a bit
to include Several different ANTI-TBClean ideas, a TBSIG-infector a couple of
other nefarious anti-tbav ideas.  Most of this has been published already in
other well known publications and was included to make this as complete as
possible.

  Since the original data for this article came from Rajaat and since he's the
one pioneering the TBSIG infector I figured to give him the majority of credit.

  When you start to look through these articles you begin to relize that these
bugs/problems have been around for ages and TBAV still hasn't fixed them.  The
TBSIG infector is kinda version specific but should provide the basis for
further development of this idea.  Articles 3, 4, 5 should however be good till
those idiots at TBAV wake up and smell the coffee.  Been over a year and they
haven't done it yet so figure those odds.
