Introduction
컴컴컴컴컴컴

  This document will correct the released information about the documented
API's and describe the undocumented API's of ThunderBYTE Anti-Virus. This
document will also inform you of an flaw in TBMEM and TBSCANX.

ThunderBYTE Anti-Virus API's
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

--------v-2F13-------------------------------
INT 2F - TBDISK - SET DISK INTERRUPT HANDLER
        AX = 13h
        DS:DX -> new disk interrupt handler
Return: DS:DX -> previous disk interrupt handler
        ES:BX -> previous disk interrupt handler
Notes:  This is not at all an API. TbDisk watch for this function to protect
          the address of the original interrupt 13h handler, which one would
          be able to get by calling this function if TbDisk wasn't resident.
--------v-2F1605-----------------------------
INT 2F - TBDRIVER - WINDOWS ENHANCED MODE & 286 DOSX INIT BROADCAST
        AX = 1605h
        CX = 0000h
Return: ES:BX -> startup info structure (ES = segment of TbDriver, BX = 01FAh)
Notes:  This is not at all an API. TbDriver watch for this function and
         returns the appropriate values, making it Windows compatible.
        The previous function is called before TbDriver's own function and it
         is the returned registers, from the previous function, TbDriver's own
         function reacts too.
--------v-2F1605-----------------------------
INT 2F - TBSCANX - DISABLE
        AX = 1605h
Notes:  This is not at all an API. TbScanX watch for this function to make it
         Windows compatible.
--------v-2F1605-----------------------------
INT 2F - TBMEM - DISABLE
        AX = 1605h
        DL = flags
            bit 0 = 1 if Microsoft 286 DOS extender exit
Notes:  This is not at all an API. TbMem watch for this function to make it
         Windows compatible.
--------v-2F1606-----------------------------
INT 2F - TBSCANX - ENABLE
        AX = 1606h
Notes:  This is not at all an API. TbScanX watch for this function to make it
         Windows compatible.
--------v-2F1606-----------------------------
INT 2F - TBMEM - ENABLE
        AX = 1606h
Notes:  This is not at all an API. TbMem watch for this function to make it
         Windows compatible.
--------v-2FC9FD-----------------------------
INT 2F - TBLOG - WRITE STRING TO LOG
        AX = C9FDh
        DS:SI -> ASCIZ string (max 110 chars)
Return: AH = 00h
        AL = last character in string
        CX = number of unused characters in string
        SI,DI destroyed
Notes:  The string can also be terminated with a '%'-character.
        This API is never called within ThunderBYTE Anti-Virus.
--------v-2FCA00-----------------------------
INT 2F - TBSCANX - INSTALLATION CHECK
        AX = CA00h
Return: AX = C9FFh if installed
            BX = 7462h ('tb')
Notes:  TbScanX doesn't check if BX = 5442h ('TB') when this API is called, as
         ThunderBYTE Anti-Virus states in their APPENDUM.DOC.
        This API is never called within ThunderBYTE Anti-Virus.
--------v-2FCA04-----------------------------
INT 2F - TBSCANX - SCAN FILE
        AX = CA04h
        DS:DX -> filename
Return: CF clear if no virus signatures found
          AX,BX,CX,SI,DI,ES destroyed
        CF set if signature found
            ES:BX -> ASCIZ virus name
Notes:  This API is never called within ThunderBYTE Anti-Virus.
        This API is not available unless TbScanX is installed with
         parameter: i, when executed.
        This API doesn't seem to work, it was unable to detect any virus when
         found tested.

Final notes
컴컴컴컴컴

  The above described API's has been working since, at least ThunderBYTE
Anti-Virus v 7.00.

  Before executing the infected file, make sure that your virus executes the
following seven bytes: B80516B201CD2F. The virus will then exploit the API in
TBMEM and TBSCANX.

  This document has been mailed to Ralf Brown and the information contained
herein will most likely be included in the next release of Ralf Brown's
Interrupt list.
