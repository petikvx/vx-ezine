What's going on?
  Well the Source of Kaos is back .. back for a bit at least.  Sorry for the
big delay between this issue and the previous.  Things got a bit hectic and
scrambled and I do mean scrambled.  There's been quite a bit of movement in
the virus scene since SOK-I came out.   SOK is an independent based zine, some
of my sources have been taken down or joined a group. On the flip side there
are now a few coders out there that have joined the independent ranks.  This
massive movement in the virus scene has caused problems in coming up with new
viruses and articles.
  As of this writing the official email address for this zine is
sok@int21h.org.  This email goes through a UUCP connection, so it may take a
bit for me to respond to email.  The current home page for SOK has worked out
well, but a move may be in the works.

SOK-3
  Enough of the bleeding heart bullshit/excuses and lets get down to business
about  what's in the future.  As of this writing, SOK-3 is moving along nicely
and has 3 previously unseen viruses along with some boot sector infectors 
( Seems I've been neglecting the MBR portion of coding.)  Also debuting will 
be the start of a series showing how to link/use different mutation engines 
with different virus engines. ( This combination should really reek havoc with 
the AV'rs ) * Thus the masses will have an easy to follow guide on something 
that has always been difficult to do.  A look at a the EntWife - (that is 2 
viruses spliced together), a REXX virus written for OS/2 and a little 
something written in Pascal. Last but not least, if Methyl gets the time 
Tunnel Tutorial #3 will be included.

Cutting Edge Technology

  Some of this stuff may not be cutting edge technology and some of it may.

1.  Seems someone is pissed at TBAV since it seems a TBSIG virus is almost done.
    If AV rumors are true then the next TBAV will have changed thier data
    format ... and the race is on ...
2.  Rumors of an UNPACK.AVP virus have been circulating .. this one will have
    to wait, since it appears that AVP has changed it's data file structor to
    a compressed encrypted format.
3.  A virus that doesn't open or close a file ??  Just ask the folks at IR/G.
4.  Win95 TSR viruses have hit the streets .. now that the cherry is broken
    there should be a movement from DOS to Win95 viruses..
5.  A windows virus that recompiles itself to make it polymorphic .. yep ..
