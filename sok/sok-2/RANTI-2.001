     Well believe it or not this little zine of mine has made it to it's
second issue.   Let's see this issue is ... wow ... damn near 9 months late,
you could almost call it my Microsoft time schedule.  Quite a bit has changed
since the inaugural edition.  A new job,  followed by a bout
with cancer threw the time schedule out of wack.  A large shift in the VX
community has shifted many of the players around.  Most of the old guard
haven't move the ones that did haven't gone far.  VLAD is still VLAD, but if
rumors are true then VLAD#7 was the last issue from the group.  Immortal Riot
merged with Geneses to form IR/G and thus another issue of IR was released.
The group DC is gone while most of it's members have joined other groups or
just retired.  Some of the independents that contributed to the initial issue
have faded away or been shut down.  This shift of people has done nothing that
can't be worked with or around .

     The overall scope of this zine hasn't changed at all.. " the creation of
Kaos to keep things interesting".  What has changed is what will go in and what 
the language the virus is written in.  Starting with this issue I will try to 
do the following:

        1.  Introduce at least 3 original viruses per issue.
        2.  Come out at irregular intervals. - monthly or so -
        3.  Provide quality viruses for your entertainment.
                Truth is, quality is in the eye of the beholder.
        4.  Ensure that all the viruses have been tested and work.
                My test puter is out so until then ...
        5.  Provide tools and utilities for virus collecting..
        6.  Won't come with a fancy interface or a ton of ANSI pics. blah
                I run OS/2 and vga only mags suck under OS/2
        7.  A variety of viruses ranging in complexity & cuteness..
                COM/EXE/SYS/MBR - Polymorphic - cute displays etc..
        8.  A bonus section which in the future will be harder to get at "haha"

     SOK-2 debuts our first non-assembly based virus, for your viewing
pleasure we have ZIP-Devil.  This little baby was released and found in the
newsgroups on or about the new year.  So for posterity it has been included in 
this issue.

  If your wondering who I am, I'll give you a quick rundown..  I am virus
collector with a small interest in programming..  One day I found that I had
over 4.5 meg of zipped  source code.  So instead of wasting it I decided to do
something with it.. Thus is born a source code zine..  Not to mention I 
believe that a little chaos keeps people from getting bored and going stagnant.

  This mag is produced by an independent source, or in other words I have no
affiliation with any virus group that may be out there..  Due to the fact that
I am an independent you should expect to see viruses from just about everyone
with no real preference on my end.. If an issue is loaded with virii from one
group or individual then that's just the way I happened to pull them out of
the air.

And for you knuckle heads who can't figure out where I got the name for this
zine..

                Kaos for the kaos that a virus creates :)

Most of this source code will assemble with TASM 2.0 or newer, some of it may
require the A86 assembler.  If you don't have an assembler -- Tough --
go out and buy one!
