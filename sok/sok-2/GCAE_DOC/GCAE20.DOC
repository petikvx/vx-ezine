 About...  
**********

        Something introduction, snipped.

************
 How to use
************

   1) This module can be use in TASM or MASM, other compiler may have problem!

   2) The following must be include in your source code. Subroutine GCAE
      is the main body of this engine, GCAE_E is not a subroutine, it is the
      pointer of the program ending, you will need it when you ask the length
      of the program.

        extrn GCAE:near,GCAE_E:near

   3) Include this when you want to encryption your source code...

        call GCAE

   4) Only setting a proper parameters, you can get your polymorphic virus.
      Remember link GCAE.OBJ in your virus.obj.

  *5) The decrypt code this engine made will not excess 1k, so you only need to
      reserve (code length+engine module length+1k(400h)) memory, remember it
      when in memory resident.

  *6) The decrypt code this engine made will use DS: ,so DS: should set to the
      original value in your virus body.

  *7) Some problem will occur in a .EXE file, it is the problem of polymorphic
      engine, but the probability is very small...



******************
 Input Parameters
******************

   1) ES : Work segment (decryptor + encrypt code).

   2) DS:DX : code address to encrypt, usually point to the head of program.

   3) CX : length of code to encrypt, use OFFSET GCAE_E to get the whole length.

   4) BX : The decryption routine's offset address. This depends on which kind
           of file you want to infect. (COM file should set BX=0100h, EXE file
           should set BX=0000h). As the result, not all virus can use this
           engine, remember this!

  *5) BP : if the encrypt code is .EXE files, set BP=0001h, COM file should  
           set it to BP=0001h or BP=0000h.


*********************
 Returning parameter
*********************

   1) DS:DX : DS:DX point to (decryptor + encrypted code. This will make the  
              writing function of int 21h easier.

   2) CX : length of decryptor + encrypted code. This will make the writing-
           function of int 21h easiter, too!

 Remark from author

   This is the second time I write polymorphic engine......snipped...
