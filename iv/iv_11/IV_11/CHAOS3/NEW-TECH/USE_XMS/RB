Note:   to hook into the XMS driver chain, a program should follow the chain of 
          far jumps until it reaches the short jump of the driver at the end    
          of the chain; this short jump is to be replaced with a far jump to    
          the new handler's entry point, which should contain a short jump      
          followed by three NOPs.  The new handler must return to the address   
          pointed at by the short jump which was overwritten.  Using this       
          method, the new handler becomes the first to see every XMS request.

Notes:  Upper Memory consists of non-EMS memory between 640K and 1024K          
        the XMS driver need not implement functions 10h through 12h to be       
          considered compliant with the standard                                
        under DOS 5+, if CONFIG.SYS contains the line DOS=UMB, then no upper    
          memory blocks will be available for allocation because all blocks     
          have been grabbed by MS-DOS while booting

 0Ah    WORD    destination handle                                              
 0Ch    DWORD   offset into destination block                                   
Notes:  if source and destination overlap, only forward moves (source base      
          less than destination base) are guaranteed to work properly           
        if either handle is zero, the corresponding offset is interpreted       
          as a real-mode address referring to memory directly addressable       
          by the processor

Note:   if the A20 handler number returned in BL is 00h, an external handler    
          is being used (see AX=4330h)
