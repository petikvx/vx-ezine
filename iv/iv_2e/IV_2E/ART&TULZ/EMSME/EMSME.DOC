            Digest of IV 8 - 11 russian, including Moscow issues

                Eternal Maverick Small Mutation Engine
                            Version 1.5

    This is an enchanced version of EMSPE published in Russian IV_9.

What's new:
        - Random subroutine and interrupt calls, memory operations,
          XCHG, INC and DEC, CMP and JMP constructions are added
        - Now only short variants of instructions are used
        - Two minor bugs are fixed

Good aspects:
        - It is really small and easy to use (I hope ;))
        - Different sets of registers and operations are used in decryptors
        - Garbage code is not suspicious (TBAV sets up heuristics flag only
          occasionally)
        - Non-linear code
        - Built-in antiheuristic trick

Bad aspects:
        - Basic decryptor structure is not changing
        - Subroutine and interrupt calls are not variable enough
        - Almost no commens in source

                        Additional information

        Decryptor structure and parameters can be found in EMME.ASM. Use
MAKE.BAT to build demo program. To make demo program generate the same type
of decryptor just take off ; before lines marked with ;***.
        You can use or change the code on your own way. All recommendations
on how to make it better are gratefully accepted.
        Author takes no any responsibility for any damage caused by using
or not using EMSME 1.5.
