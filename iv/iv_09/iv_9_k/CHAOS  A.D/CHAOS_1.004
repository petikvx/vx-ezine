CHAOS A.D.
^^^^^^^^^
TANKS ON THE STREETS
CONFRONTING POLICE
BLEEDING THE PLEBS
RAGING CROWD
BURNING CARS
BLOODSHED STARTS
WHO'LL BE ALIVE?
CHAOS A.D.
^^^^^^^^^^
ARMY IN SIEGE
TOTAL ALARM
I'M SICK OF THIS
INSIDE THE STATS
WAR IS CREATED
NO MAN'S LAND
WHAT IS THIS SHIT?!

REFUSE/RESIST
REFUSE

CHAOS A.D.
^^^^^^^^^^
DISORDER UNLEASHED
STARTING TO BURN
STARTING TO LYNCH
SILENCE MEANS DEATH
STAND ON YOUR FEET
INNER FEAR
YOUR WORST ENEMY

REFUSE/RESIST
