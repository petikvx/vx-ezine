Version 1.3
~~~~~~~~~~~

        The previous versions of TPE could not be used in programs
        which are not always located at the same location in memory.
        This bug has been fixed in version 1.3.
        Also another bug which could possibly cause the decryptor to
        hang on some processor types, has been fixed.
        The value of the BP register is no longer preserved when the
        TPE has finnished.


Version 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~

        The previous version 1.1 sometimes produced decryptors that
        could not run on all processor types. This bug is fixed in
        version 1.2. 
        Also a few other things were changed in this version to make
        it a little bit more polymorphic.


Version 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~

        This is the first public available version of TPE.
