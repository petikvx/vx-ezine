		Virus Warning :  Enabled ?

		AT Designers decided to cut off viruses at low level-
	by closing MBR and controlling MBR write access. They thought
	this "hard" protection was invulnerable.
		
	Really, if you're writing smthng to MBR when "Virus Warning"=ON,
	you'll hear and see the BIOS' guard barking: "Yes or No?". 
	(2B)|(!2B ) ? 2B !
	Rem. about Russian users:  a lot of users in ex-USSR don't know
	English and usually answer "Yes" on all questions if even it will
	be "Destroy all data on your hard disk ?". That's a result and 
	proves my remark that viruses continue to possess the MBR without
	borders, fighting the CMOS feature by the users' foolishness.
	But if "Virus Warning" enabled and lamer/user/enemy already warned ?
	Call the carpenter... 
	This article was written in February'95, but since that time no
	viriis have been able to penetrate the "hard" wall. Except Tchechen.
	
	What's the result of the anti-virusers new tricks ? They're able to
	stop 99, maybe 100% of viriis, existing before the anti-virus was
	issued. Naturally, the next virus lives without any trouble some
	time. The Lamers/Users trust the stupid polyfags and idiotic
	heuristics like DRWeb,FProt and TBav. And so on until the Universal
	Virus/Universal AntiVirus, appears.

		Describing this feature, especially in a WorldWide issue,
	I hope that AMI & AWARD will not run and change all their BIOS'es
	so that the survival of our living techno-creatures grows. More, the
	virus, settled in MBR, can set Virus Warning On by itself to protect
	itself from other viriis.

      Adresses from 10h to 20h are protected by a checksum to detect hardware 
      or battery faults. It's simply a 16-bit sum.
      AMI BIOS has a checksum for other CMOS regions, namely for 30-3Dh,
 stored in 3Eh,3Fh (high,low). The rest isn't explored by me yet.
 
      The checksum, as you will find, ISN'T protected, so you can correct it
 to avoid "CMOS checksum failure.." at bootup.  
      Known viruses already "work" with CMOS, perverting and clearing it.
 Not a frightening disaster. I lost my CMOS many times during experiments for
 this article, and nothing bad has happened.
      If the checksum on bootup doesn't match with with the stored, all CMOS
 together with passwords etc. can be zeroed. Hard drive not found, Keyboard
 not installed (imagine real keyboard uninstallation - Press "Del", but
 where ?)
	
      Let's skip the first 33h CMOS bytes - it's a field for CMOS perverts,
 we're walking direct to the Reserved Area. What's reserved specially for
 us ?  A lot. Bootup sequence, Password, Virus Warning. The Attacking virus
 can not only fuck up the hard drive, but lock itself by Password (and user
 will learn where the CMOS battery is situated ), then change bootup sequence
 to "C: A:" and boot itself from infected drive C:...
      We'll return to passwords in another article, we'll now go to the
 Virus Warning.

      The most popular are AWARD and AMI BIOSes. What's the difference
 between them ?
