
HELLO, WORLD !
We proudly present you with the first English issue of The Infected Voice -
the electronic magazine for virmakers in Russia. Our magazine is well known
in the ex-USSR region - Russia, Ukraine, BieloRussia, Middle Asia. We've
issued ten so far, but, unfortunately, it couldn't reach the World - it was
in the Russian language. This magazine is a fast digest from our seven 
issues, the next; we're gonna issue our zine in English too, - if we get 
a response from The World, i.e. from You.
We're waitin' for your response, and ready to co-operate with you by any
means in the field of virus creation and distribution. We don't deal with
antivirusers!

   Fruit and multiply, and replenish the Earth.
						LovinGOD, SGWW President.
