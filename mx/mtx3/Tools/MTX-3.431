Anonymous IP/port redirect tool

Schadenfreude is composed of a server and a client. The server install itself
and run, in a predetermined port, a interface for a client create, list and
delete new ip/port redirections. The server can be compiled to install itself
to run in every boot, and use stealth functions, patching kernel32.dll in 
memory to hide his process and .exe file in disk.

After you connect with the client to the  server, you can create ip/port 
redirect, to hide your true IP in the internet. If you type, in the editboxes
left the redirect button, "irc.ircserver.com" and "6667", and then press the
button, the server will reply with a port number, that will be added to the 
active ip/ports redirect list. You can delete this redirection copying the
port number it was assigned to the editbox at left of remove button, and 
pressing it.

To access the redirected ip/port, you must connect to the serverïs IP and in
the port returned for this redirect. You will be connecting to the original
IP/port, but hidding your own IP from the destiny IP.
