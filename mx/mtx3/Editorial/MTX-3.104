BAT.Kasperk

  Is a nondangerous non memoryresident non encrypted silly bat virus. 

  It infects hard drives and diskettes that are inserted in the drive.

  This virus was found in the wild in the infamous AVPVPEVE virus encyclopedia inserted into
 
  a html file. It have a low risk spread and uses undocumented MS-DOS commands.

  But it cant spread correctly due a bug when the a:\ diskette is write-protected

  and seems to the author does not have enough computer programming knowledge.

  It contains the "copyrigth" text strings that there are also the main virus body

  "REM Kaspersky by Eugene/AVP
   SYS A:
   COPY *.* A:
   SYS B:
   COPY *.* B:
   SYS C:
   COPY *.* C:"
