5 .EXE in this pack:
 
-- FREEJC.EXE  (844 bytes)
-- FREEJC2.EXE  (846 bytes)
-- CRACK4JC.EXE  (868 bytes)

-- WIN95.EXE  (1046 bytes)
-- WINNT.EXE  (1052 bytes)


What is that...?

This five progs modify Registry Base and put active the file sharing
and print sharing ;=)
Then u can hack the remote computer with NBTSTAT (or NETBIOS session).



FREEJC.EXE: modify Registry and activate (after reboot) File & Print Sharing.
			Join it to another .exe, with a tool like TOP, ELITE PACKER, 
            INFECTOR,... (u can rename it)
			
FREEJC2.EXE: same of FREEJC.EXE but it will lock the computer, forcing the user
			 to reboot ;=)  (u can rename it)

CRACK4JC.EXE: same of FREEJC2.EXE, modify registry, reboot computer, and auto-delete
			  himself. You CAN NOT rename this!!!
			  Say it's the last best crack...hehe



WIN95.EXE: C:\ will be shared with this prog, u can rename it.
	       But before to launch it, the remote computer must have file sharing OK 
           (with Freejc, or Freejc2, or Crack4jc, ...)

WINNT.EXE: same of WIN95.EXE, but is for Windows NT; u can rename it, too.



  With FREEJC suite, File Sharing will be ON, then u can use NBTSTAT to hack the 
remote computer.
 
  Use SMBScanner, he scan IP ranges for File Sharing, and has other good features.

All this .EXE are crypted & anti-débug (little...).
