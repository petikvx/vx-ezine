Now I'm presenting for attention of respected DOS users my second and, I hope, not last
virus (the first virus was named &quot;Antipas.1101&quot;). This virus<br>
is 2200 bytes long and is named &quot;$tart&quot;. If it will be widespread and, as
result, get into the bases of some antiviruses, I ask for name it &quot;$tart.2200&quot;
or, in the last resort, &quot;Start.2200&quot;. I wrote this virus for my personal
purposes (see effects below), but I hope it will be useful for someone else. I'm not a
distributor of this virus, so I don't bear any responsibility for the injury to the
software, caused by virus. The writing of the virus was finished 18.11.1998 at 20:00.
Autor - DJ Sadovnikov. And now I tell you about the virus explicitly (for whose whom
laziness to look the source text).<br>
<br>
&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">-</font> The general information: virus requires the 286+
processor. The check of presence of required processor isn't made in cause of practically
complete absence of machines with CPU 86/186. The usage of 286-instructions allows to
optimize a code considerably. DOS version 3.x-6.x required. The check of DOS version is
made in cause of incorrectly virus's operation under Windows, because Windows doesn't
support SFT (for whose who doesn't know: Windows returns DOS version 7.x). Other
operational system weren't tested.<br>
&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">-</font> Resident, takes up about 4500 bytes of memory.
Staying resident via correction of MCB-segment of program-carrier. There is a little bug
here: as a result of MCB&nbsp;&nbsp; correction cease to work some programs packed by
EXEPACK (but not all). I don't know why does it take place - honourly speaking, it's lazy
to look into.<br>
&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">-</font> The virus infects EXE files. Doesn't touch overlays.
The type of the file is determined by the extension first, and then - by the first two
bytes (MZ) in case of this is maybe COM-file renamed into EXE. The increase of lenghth of
the infected file is 2200 bytes. While infecting file, virus corrects both CS:IP and
SS:SP. Virus infects files at the executing and opening. While infecting, uses STF. I
apologize for virus doesn't infect COM-files. The point is that COM-files are
disappearing, besides the procedure of it's infecting will highly increase the virus's
cumbersomely. Although, MZ-EXE files will disappearing soon too. It's time for me to move
on to NE-EXE and PE-EXE infecting.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">-</font> The virus is twice encrypted. The first procedure of
encryption is ordinary XOR. The key changes from file to file. The second procedure - XOR
and SUB/ADD. The key changes from byte to byte according to easy law. The antidebugging
technology is used, based on the registration of the decrypting procedure as an interupt
Int1/Int3. The overlapping code is used too, which complicates a research of virus after
disassembling a little.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">-</font> Stealth. At the catalog reading corrects lengths of the
infected files. This method doesn't work at the performance of DIR command in cause of
using FCB by DIR. At the opening of a file the virus treats it, at the closing - infects
it again. At the executing of some archivers (see source) and CHKDSK program virus
disables it's stealth mechanism until the next file will be executed. I hope you
understand why does it necessary.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">-</font> The virus determines the real Int21h handler's address via
tracing. It will not work if somebody made the splicing (inserting a jump to itseft at the
beginning of the handler), or the antitrace protection is presented. When the virus is in
memory already, at the attempting of tracing of Int21h handler it displays the message
(see source) and halts the system.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">-</font> The Int24h (disk write-protect) stub is presented, but it
doesn't correctly work, and the cause is unknown for me.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">-</font> The 18th of May (my birthday) virus displays the text (see
source) at the top of screen and drops the chars with a sound effect. When virus infects
500th file (not on the&nbsp;&nbsp; concrete computer, and in general), it displays a
message (see source) and waits for key pressed.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">-</font> When the follow string (? ????ом ???????&nbsp;) appears
at the screen:<br>
<font color="#0000FF">*</font> &quot;Show virus info&quot; -- displays copyright message
(see source)<br>
<font color="#0000FF">*</font> &quot;Crack HDD&quot; -- erases MBR using ports, so BIOS's
&quot;Virus Warning&quot; will not help even.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">*</font> &quot;Erase CMOS&quot; -- erases CMOS.<br>
<font color="#0000FF">*</font> &quot;Reboot system&quot; -- reboots computer.<br>
<font color="#FF0000">-</font> At the virus's beginning the string &quot;Packed file is
corrupt$&quot; is presented. It can confuse somebody who takes into his head to look over
the infected program at the healthy computer.<br>

<br>
[!] Memory allocation is made very incorrectly.<br>
[!] At the returning to program-carrier SS has a wrong value.<br>
[+] The installation of Int24h handler is made incorrectly.<br>
[+] Attemption of read/write to standart devices is possible.<br>
