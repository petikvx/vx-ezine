About VirusWorld:

	VirusWorld is put out once to twice a week. It is the most 
anti-government, virii, IRCWAR, etc. magazine around. It 
covers the important stuff.
	VirusWorld is run, produced, written, by only 2 people 
as of now, RacerX, and LiveRebel. They are very good at 
programming. Both belong to very famous groups 
(Unmentionable). 
	VirusWorld is a magazine that breaks all the rulez. "We 
just plain out don't give a phuck of what people think," says 
RacerX. People can write, do whatever they want to hurt are 
rep, we don't care, but remember, paybacks are bitches. So 
don't cry when you get a virus, your page gets hacked, or your 
"good" reputation turns into everyone thinking your a faggot.
