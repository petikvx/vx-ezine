It's a SKAM!

	You would think with a well organized group like 
SkamWerksc you would atleast be able to write a decent program. 
Well I have reviewed the outcome of SKWlab, a program to write 
macro's. 
	Let me tell you... It sux the biggest COCK I have ever 
seen(This is not a ediqute mag.). It is looks like someone was on 
cane when they made it. Some one was in a MAJOR hurry.
	First off....... When you go too run the program, it preforms 
an illegal operation. This is due to the fact that it is sent to a place 
on your computer that isn't even there.
	Second when I fixed that problem, the macro was a peice of 
shit. I ran it through my own computer, and had it fixed in a matter 
of seconds.
	I would not suggest getting that proggy. I like SkamWerks, I 
hope we never have another problem like that again.
