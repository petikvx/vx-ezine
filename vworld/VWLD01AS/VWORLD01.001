	AOHell '96 God or Fraud

	At first when I saw this proggy I was excited and jumped on the oppertunity to get 
it as anyone would just because of the well known name.  After a month of use I 
discovered that this program is not all it is cracked up to be.  Although some of the 
features work the most intrequing of all does not.  
	The Text Manipulator is a cleverly thought up scheme by SoSo to trick you into 
thinking that you are manipulateing someone's text in a chat room but it turns out that you 
are the only one that can see it. What a fraud!!! 
	But this is not the only reason that this is a bad program, there is a major problem 
with almost all of the bots and the mail bomber is lame and the toser doesn't work without 
a password and no one has this alleged password so it is rendered inopperable. 	Overall 
this program SuX and ya would have a better time with something like Super Mad Cow 
Final, X-Zone5, or The Exorcist because these are all well thought out programs and they 
all work Great!!
