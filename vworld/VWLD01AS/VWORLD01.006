Type: All Around 

	\X/aStEd is a GREAT all around script. I think it is one of the best 
that I have ever come across. Right now the script is not done, but it will 
be in the near future.
	\X/aStEd will include:
*Protection
*SpyBot
*WarBot
*Klones
*Shut Up kicks
*Script Modes
*Ops Protection
*CTCP protection
*Control over all \X/aStEd scripts ***NEW***
*CTCP commands
*Floods
	Those are just a few of the great trix you will find in \X/aStEd. For 
more information on \X/aStEd, you can reach hell at:
