Infection of biological DNA with digital Computer Code by SPTH
SPTH  shows  a  method  how  a computer code can infect biological DNA, and 
thereby    spread    itself   in   the   biological-chemical  world   as  a 
self-replicating bacterium.


Cross Script Infection using MetaLanguages by SPTH
SPTH  describes  the  use of meta-level lenguages to create cross-scripting
viruses.  You can see this new technique in action in his new:
JS/VBS/MatLab/Ruby/Python.Polygamy virus.

GPUs. You can see this new technique in action in her new W32.GLaDOS virus.


GPU powered file infector by hh86
hh86 describes how to implement CUDA capable GPU to aid in self-replication
algorithms.   You can see this new technique in action in her W32.GLaDOS (B)
virus.
