Whupeefuckingduh! Valhalla #4 is finally there

It has been about one year since the last issue of valhalla and for the
second  time, I am very proud to be a part of it. As always, let's talk
about, what happened since the last ezine.
We  had  a  fake  VXing  group  coming up, the long awaited relaunch of 
VXHeavens,  which brought some life back into the scene and in October, 
Inception #1 was released by pr0mix. I had my finals this year and also
started studing. That's why I wasn't able to write many codes this year
but luckily I finished one just in time for this ezine.
I  hope,  that  we'll  see some new VXers appear due to the relaunch of
VXHeavens.
I hope for us to see many great new techniques in this ezine.
Enjoy reading!
