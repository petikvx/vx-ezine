It is a sad thing that in recent times, some of the most active members of the scene were attacked on a forum for being the most active members of the scene.
For example, hh86, SPTH, and me.  hh86 and I focus on the technique.  SPTH focuses on the concept.
When hh86 and I write the code, the new idea is deep inside the container that does not need to change.
To complain about this is to see the oyster shell and say that they all look the same, but then to miss the pearl that is inside.
When SPTH writes the code, the entire virus is the idea.  Some of those ideas are so new and different that they are hard to understand.
To complain about this is to complain about imagination.
So let us all use our imagination and make more pearls, and together we can defeat the fools who cannot see the beauty in what we do.
