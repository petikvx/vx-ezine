Wohooo - into valhalla for the 3rd time :-o :) :D ;)


Congratulations and thank you to hh86 for this awesome magazine! The project she
has started about two years ago continues, and with it the possibility for
motivated coders to release some cool new VX stuff.
                       
This is now actually the fourth e-zine of a series:
- 01.01.2011: virus writing bulletin 2011 - valhalla #0 :-)
- 05.08.2011: valhalla #1
- 15.03.2012: valhalla #2
- 21.12.2012: valhalla #3

So thanks alot to hh86 for this zine again, and for the whole motivation last
few months, and sharing all those fine ideas.

Also thanks goes to roy g biv for being such a reliable contributor to the
VX world for so many years (even you're taking longer to answere mails as usual
recently, hope everything is good!).

Hello and welcome to valhalla goes to r3s1stanc3 - hope you continue your nice
projects! :)

Hi as well goes to (o) - nice to have you on board. Cool true RNG. What about
a QRNG next time? :)

Thanks for the great interviews to Eric Filiol, Marc Stamp and VirusBuster!!! It
is awesome that scientific reserachers looking at this nice topic as well, and
having such great ideas and perspectives. I would suggest you to look at the
topic of self-learning viruses as well - we need some new fresh ideas there :)

Best greets and lot of thanks goes to herm1t, who has supported us for so many
years! Its very sad what happend to you and our library this year - but i dont
want to mention anything further, this should be a happy moment with good
feelings only. I just hope everything works our fine for you very soon, and you
can provide us again with this genious library and your great ideas/codes!

After VX Heavens went done, and with it my homepage, Perforin was so nice to
provide me a new nice place. Thanks alot for that! Wish you much luck with
the future of DC! And continue those crazy projects like infecting Samson TVs :)

Greets goes also to Peter Ferrie who enjoyed analysing our codes for some quite
some time now (even if i have the feeling that he tries to fool us by mentioning
bugs, mistakes in source-comments or even typos in the payload :D) - Keep up the
good job!




I guess there is nothing left to say - this release is an evidence that there
are people interested in the original kind of virus-writing: the discovering of
new techniques and methods to infect files, to find ways infiltrating new
systems, to find novel concepts to hide code - to think about the future of
self-replicating codes.

We dont harm anybody! We do it because we enjoy it, and because we know other
people enjoy it too. :)

I see the virus writing is alive.
