Most  people  reading  this  ezine  won't know me and there is a simple 
reason for that: I'm only about half a year active in the VX scene.
Until  now,  I  only releases my codes in one ezine (DarK-CodeZ #4 [1]) 
and  some  codes  on  my  blog.  But  now I'm very proud to get my code 
published  in  Valhalla  #3.  I  want  to  thank  everybody  who helped 
producing  this  magazine  and  I  hope  we  get  to see some great new 
techniques here.

In the end I want to greet a few people:
 SPTH		- thx for helping me with my article and telling me of Valhalla #3
 hh86		- thx for the possibility to release my code here
 herm1t		- even if I don't know you, I hope VXHeavens will be up again soon
 Perforin	- hope we'll see more of your codes in EOF #4; see ya in January
 
 
enjoy reading
