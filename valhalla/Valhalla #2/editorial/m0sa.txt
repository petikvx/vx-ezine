First of all, it is a great honor for me to be among those great coders here in
Valhalla 2. I’d like to give SPTH very deep warm thanks for giving me the
opportunity to have an article here. I also like to thank hh86 for her awesome
codes. Moreover, I’d like to thank roy g biv for his valuable contribution that
enriched the scene. Huge thanks goes to the big genius guys from which I’ve
learnt the most: Z0mbie, Benny, and The Mental Driller. Last but not least,
those elites Peter Szor and Peter Ferrie cannot be forgotten and I will always
thank them.

Finally, that's how I see virus writing:

A virus is not malware  .. it is a genius-ware

Writing a virus is like playing chess with myself, as soon as I create one, I
immediately think about how to catch it.

See you in Valhalla # 3 with some android codes :)
