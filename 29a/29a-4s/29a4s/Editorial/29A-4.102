  Chen Ing-hau, the author of the Win95.CIH family was arrested, to be
released just a few days later, because no complaints were filed in Taiwan.
Wahoo International Enterprise Co. a Taiwan based computer company later hired
Chen Ing-hau. Chen Ing-hau admitted he was the author of the Win95.CIH.

  F-Secure Corporation got infected by VBS.Freelink, the virus spread itself
from F-Secure Corporation and F-Secure Corporation helped distribute
VBS.Freelink worldwide.

  Evul was forced to change the policy of coderz.net and no virus binaries are
allowed on coderz.net, virus source codes, e-zines, tutorials, etc. are
still allowed and very welcome.

  The Lich started a rumor that he had commited suicide, this was just a few
days later disproven, when he was seen at Undernet #virus using a different
handle.

  It's known the FBI read the e-mail which went through coderz.net over a
period of time. It's unknown if they are still doing it.

  The last year brought us quite a few meetings. One in Amsterdam, one in
Paris, a few in Valencia, a few in Brno and a few in other places around the
world. Thanks to everybody who took time to participate in the meetings.
Benny/29A wrote an article about one of the meetings in Brno, this is what he
wrote:

Another meeting, smaller than in Amsterdam, was done in Czech republic. Becoz
we, I and Prizzy, r from Czech republic and that time there was a fair
exibition about information technologies (Invex, something like CeBIT, but much
bigger), we decided we should meet each other and have a lot of fun.
More than that happend...

Meeting officialy started in 6th of October 1999 at 8:30am in front of the
ground, where fair took place. After some minutes we surprisely recognized each
other :). We visited every important place in the fair, such as toilets,
benches, fast-food, police, Creative Labs, Autodesk, Micro$oft, Inprise, one
AV firm (there was only this one), some internet provider etc...
At Micro$oft, we used their netwerk (veeeeery unstable :D) to satisfy our
needs - IRC :D. Funny stuff is that proxy server generated our address as
"microsoft.invex.cz". Can u imagine face of those ppl who were on IRC :).
That guy (when he saw me how im reading some VX page) then asked me, if I'm
VXer or if I'm trying to infect that system. I said, that if I would like to do
that, it would be already done now. He replied me: "Haha, no, u wouldn't Win2k
is perfect OS - registry r protected against write and there's not any such
virus, which would be break it" :))) [* Hi GriYo, Win32.CTX is very nice :D *]
Also, that meeting with AV was also awesome :DD. Firstly, we collect all those
papers and CDs and then talked with one AVer. It was very kewl, but I won't
say here any details, coz it wouldn't be fair to him. I can only say, that they
had very tasty beer X-DD. That's a pity that there was only one AV firm.
While we was walking thru the pavilons, we talked a lot about our stuffs.
Prizzy talked about his viruses Win32.Crypto and Win95.Prizzy and other stuff
such as polymorphic engines. . I talked (as usual :D) about Thread and Fibers
and about metamorphism. Prizzy said, that he has full brain of those shits and
that I can explain it to him in the pub. Also I was astonished, when he started
to explain me the principles of his "original way how to check, if file is
already infected". It's based on some strange things called logarithms :)).
Then we decided to leave and go to some pub. I chose my favourite one. After we
drank some beers, we started to talked about that damned metamorphism, threads,
logarithms, fibers, polymorphism and such like. We wrote everything on one big
paper and when I started to draw my ideas to paper (i think it was something
about meta, but i don't know it sure :D), some old man, which sat with us at
one table, asked us: "Sorry guys, I know shit about that things u talked about,
but I would like to know, if u can fool girls by that?" We immediately started
to laugh and then we started to talk with him. When we said, that we r
virus writers, that man got very angry. We talked about VXing and 29A and so on
and then we left. But before we left, that man asked us if we have any mark(?!).
I wrote "29A" on the paper, said "maybe in a future u will hear about us" and
left with Prizzy the pub :)))
Finally, when we was really drunk, we went to the railway station - Prizzy had
to go home. It was something about 10:30pm and when cashier said, that the
nearest train will arrive at 2:36am, I thought I will have to sleep there :)).
We were both very tired and drunk X-D. I started to talk about Amsterdam, where
Prizzy wasn't, so long that after some minutes I didn't know, what I talked
about before two minutes :). Finally, after many hours of sitting on a chair,
train arrived, so we said good-bye to each other and Prizzy went away...

Meeting was full of phun and entertainment and I hope noone of us will ever
forget it.

  VGrep, also known as IntelServ, has been impersonating virus- coders and
traders to trick people into giving him virus binaries and source codes which
were not meant for him.

  29A has moved homepage quite a few times in the last year. 29A's homepage
has also been completely re-designed.

  Sourceofkaos.com, sok4ever.zone.ne.jp and virusexchange.org are all
currently down and all for different reasons. Sourceofkaos.com re-opened
a few months after it closed but will not be hosting virus oriented homepages
any longer. It's very doubtful virusexchange.org will come back up at all.
There still is a slight chance sok4ever.zone.ne.jp might come back up.
The webmaster of sok4ever.zone.ne.jp sent everybody he hosts homepages for an
E-mail the day sok4ever.zone.ne.jp went down, this is what he wrote:

Hello.

This is very "Important Information". New law are to be settled Feb 13 in Japan. This's fatal one for all Hacker/VXers. For this law all sites which contain H/C/V may be illigal in Japan. Coz SOK4EVER is obliged to close temporary. ;)

Sadly i cant do anything facing with Big Brother...;))

I'll delete all contents in SOK4EVER tomorrow. Don't worry, i back up all contents in SOK4EVER. Someday may recover the SOK4EVER.

the Tiny '99 Open contest. A smallest macro virus contest was held and the
results was as follows:

  The last year brought us quite a few new virus oriented e-zines and few new
virus oriented groups. Unfortunately a few virus groups has also disbanded in
the last year.

  Foxz decided to leave NoMercy Virus Team (NVT) along with the virus scene
and to stop coding viruses. He sent an E-mail to a few people in the virus
scene with his decision. This is what he wrote:

  Int13h decided to leave International Knowledge eXchange (iKx), along with
the virus scene and stopped coding viruses because of a new law in Paraguay,
which makes it illegal to code viruses.

  Billy Belcebu left Dichlore Diphenyl Trichloretane (DDT) to later join
International Knowledge eXchange (iKx). Bumblebee left Ultimate Chaos (UC) to
later join 29A.

  Kamaileon joined Cyber Criminals Clan (3C) and later left the group, to join
ShadowVx to later again leave that group aswell. Bhunji left ShadowVx aswell,
just a few days before Kamaileon left ShadowVx.

  Benny, Bumblebee, LethalMind, Lord Julus, Prizzy and Qozah all applied for
membership in 29A, got accepted and are now members of 29A.

  Jacky Qwerty, Qozah, Vecna and Z0mbie all decided to leave 29A for different
reasons. We thank them for the time and effort they put into 29A and they will
always have a special place in our hearts.
