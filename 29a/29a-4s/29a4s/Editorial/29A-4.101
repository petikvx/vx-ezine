  Welcome to the fourth, and if things go as we want them to, certainly not
the last issue of 29A Magazine.

  Another year has passed and we've all grown a year old, some of us
have even grown two years older since the release of 29A Magazine issue 3,
we're very sorry it took us this long to release 29A Magazine issue 4,
we can only hope it's been worth the wait.

  We've had a bit of change of heart, we said in 29A Magazine issue 3, that
would most likely never again make it a goal to release 29A Magazine within a
year, that's exactly the goal for the next issue of 29A Magazine.

  We promised in 29A Magazine issue 3 that we would stop releasing 29A
Magazine at certain dates. We kept this promise as neither 29A Magazine
issue 3 or issue 4 were released at certain dates. Both issues of 29A Magazine
was released when they were finished and when we were satisfied with the
beta-testing and that's one of the things we'll continue to do.

  We also said we'd work very hard to get http://www.29A.org back up. We
haven't been able to fulfil that promise yet but we're still working on it and
haven't given up on it. You'll be able to read more about that at our current
homepage, when we succeed.

  We've always taken pride in giving help, support and contribute to other
e-zines and groups and this is something we hope we'll be able to continue
doing. We know only too well the importance of support and contributions, that
is why we always have done our very best to support and contribute to other
groups and e-zines.

  A very important note: 29A Magazine issue 4 has to be extracted using Long
FileName (LFN).

  We all hope you enjoy reading this issue of 29A Magazine, we certainly
enjoyed making it, even though, as always, these last couple of months were
hard.
