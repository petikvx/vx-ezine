     Well...  hello  everybody! I'm pretty proud of being able to write again
 in  one of the coolest e-zines around. The story of my join to the 29A group
 is quite short but worths mentioning.

     It  all  started  2  years  ago in 1997 when I decided to join the viral
 community. Back then I collected e-mail addresses of all known virus authors
 and started to write them. The first one to answer was a guy who looked very
 cool  in his answer. His name: MrSandman... You all know all this came to my
 poly article being published in 29A#2. Since then my bond with the 29A group
 grew stronger as did my friendship with MrSandman.

     After a short but so nice time in the SLAM group, after my Vxtasy e-zine
 released,  after  MrSandman's	visit  at my house for two weeks, after Jacky
 Qwerty  almost  came  with  him  (;-))  I decided to join the group. A short
 request  on  IRC  followed by the voting... You don't know my joy as I found
 out all members agreed my join to the group.

     Perhaps  in this millenium issue I wasn't able to participate a lot as I
 put a lot of my time in the previous releases but I hope to work more in the
 future.

     I	know, that (as said in one cool movie), only "losers are trying their
 best", but this is how it came out...

     Anyway,  I  have to say, I'm pretty sick and tired of all the shit going
 on  around  me...  (woops!,  you  say,  here he starts again with one of his
 boooooooring  stories... So what... Deal with it!!! ;->>)... Yeah, people...
 I  have  decided that life really, really, really sucks! Ok, now I know that
 all  of  you will jump over me and start giving advices and crap, like there
 are  chicks and there is booze and there are bars and the Disco, and the MTV
 and  the video games and the sun and the beach and the mountain and the snow
 and Christmass and New Year's Eve and Haloween and my birthday and the trips
 and the friends and the family and my programs and all tha crap around which
 gives	you the false impression that you are doing great... It's all a shit,
 really...

     First  of	all the life on Earth is misunderstood: we are working 60% of
 our life, sleeping 40% of it just for the fun of 10%... Do you realize that?
 We are basically creating energy by our work for who knows what?!?

     And  then	there's  destiny...  Most  people say "my destiny is to write
 poetry",  or whatever... Bullshit!!! If there was a destiny than all we were
 supposed  to do is wait on our behinds for it to happen... It is us, people,
 that  create  our own destiny... Do you like being a slave for a purposeless
 society?  Do  you  want  to be the tools of a unknown power that guides your
 moves?  Do  you really, really, want to be the flesh thrown in front in case
 of  a	war?!?	I guess not!!! Then, people: FIGHT THE SYSTEM!!!! The system,
 the  very root of our life is rotten... It's like a giant piece of meat left
 in  the  sun who is now full of death worms and green skin... This is how we
 look  after  we  let  ourselves led into the games of some people who do not
 desire nothing more than what we want also: a decent life and piece of mind.
 But for them to get it, they need us to do the ugly jobs...

     Are we going to do it forever?!?! No, sireeee!!!!

     Maybe virus authoring is a very, very, very shy why of showing the world
 you  do not agree with the way it goes around... Maybe... Maybe it will have
 some  day  some  sort	of repercusion over the walk of life... My opinion is
 that it shall not... But my hope says something else... Guess it ;-)
