
  Words from the bee

  Hi all! Seems that now the way of the bee is the way of 29a. I'm double
 proud of being 29a member: as virus coder and as spanish. Bah. You could
 think that in this age of the net the country you live is not important.
 I'm agree with you.  But since i started coding viruses 29a is my dream,
 and the fact this dream speaks spanish makes it more sweet ;)

  It's strange. I've never thought to join 29a until  two friends push me
 into the group. I say it's  strange 'cause now  i can't understand why i
 didn't send my membership apply before. That's why: you cannot belong to
 your own heroes. It's hard to me,  but i'm starting to  believe  now i'm
 between the true gods. May be someday i  wake up bed  and i realize that
 i'm one of they. I hope so.

  I know i'm so new in the scene.  My travel started time ago,  but seems
 you're nothing until you don't enter the net.  To do social life seems a
 need for the virus scene. It's a pitty. hahahahaha. And it's curious who
 helped me to enter: AVP! I wonder why AVP did most of the analysis of my
 viruses while they are not a menace  or something like a new technology.
 Darkman and Virus Buster, of course,  who where my  first friends in the
 net when Bumblebee was a unknown nick and IRC was new for me.  They made
 me a bit  as now i am.  I remember when i met Darkman: the legend! And i
 think all my life i'll remember the time he said to me: 'it looks pretty
 fine to me'. That was my first poly engine. And that was the begining ;)
 Thanx you friend.

  Everybody that knows  me knows that  my english is so  lame (hehe). You
 know i'm improving  my grammar and will be the day the people understand
 me ;). This day i'll become gold! Just imagine: a  bee speaking english!
  Try to be patient with my articles  and the comments of my sources. I'm
 sure ever all is more simple than i try to explain.

  The net is important. I've  improved my  skill as  virus coder  more in
 less than a year than  in the two years i  was before coding with my old
 friends of Hail and Kill. And the ultimate way to grow as coder is this:
 join the ultimate virus coders group. Start to be scared!

  Thanks you for reading this words.  I know the feeling when a  new zine
 of 29a goes out: 'Where are the sources? Where are the sources?' ;)  I'm
 glad you had time to waste with my little presentation.
  I hope this relationship between 29a, you and me will be positive and..
 . how long? Forever is too much time. For a long while, ok? ;)

                                                       The way of the bee
