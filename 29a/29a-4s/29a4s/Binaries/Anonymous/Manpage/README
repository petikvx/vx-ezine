The manpage-virus
-----------------

INSTALL
-------

Copy virus.c into /tmp
Compile and run it. 

IF YOU DO SO, YOUR MAN-PAGES WILL BE INFECTED!

The virus itself is harmless, it doesn't delete sth.
It was written for a 'contest' in system-programming.
It infects gzipped pages as well as normal ones.
The whole sources come under the GPL, so there is 

ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. 
YOU AND ONLY YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE YOU
PRODUCE. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE SOMEONE ELSE
INFECTED MAN-PAGES. BE CAREFUL.
