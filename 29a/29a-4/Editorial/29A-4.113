 Hello everybody,

 finally I did it! I made a tea from weed and drank it. Very tasty. Then I
 smoked some cigarettes and get myself to good temper. I decided to rewrite
 this article. Yeah, I made this dummy article more realistic and more
 thinking-human kind. Previous article was too big lameness and boring. Many
 words were said about good and bad VX scene and I agree, writing same article
 again and again to confuse AVerz and lamers is really boring...

 I won't talk here about my viruses and articles and describe them. Bragging
 ain't good thing for brain; nor for mine, nor for u. And talk about shit
 in so sucking english as my english is also ain't very good step.

 Let's ask ourself, why do we code viruses. Why da hell u read this? If u r
 AVer, then just skip these lines, becoz u really won't understand it. If u r
 lamer, then I hope u will change yourself.
 Well, why do we code viruses? That's also very boring stuff - but I will make
 it more interesting. I also won't talk here about general principles. I won't
 talk about reasons, but about feelings as final product of my tries.

 Did u ever think about yourself? What sence has being on this shitty world?
 Personally, I believe in better world, but I don't hope it will become truth.
 That feeling I have when I am on IRC, talking with my friends and presenting
 them my new creations is something impossible to describe. And when I'll turn
 back and see my schoolmates, teachers, politix and other suckers, I want to
 cry. Nobody will turn back and ask u for your opinion, nobody will turn back
 and help u, even if u need it. No no, no lies.

 U can do whatever u want, however u want. Has it sence? Has it a sence to code
 viruses? Maybe, somewhere in the world r ppl, which understand u, which try
 to do everything to survive here. Maybe, they will help u, but the most
 important thing the real friend can do for u is to show u the right way.
 Maybe, those ppl have another thoughts than u - that ain't important.

 The biggest satisfy u can get is when u know, that things u do aren't so bad
 as other ppl think and that u aren't alone with the fighting with yourself and
 with the world. To have someone u can share your knowledge, ideas and
 friendship is really the most important thing. Coding GOOD viruses has the sence.
 U can present your thoughts and give to your code yourself. To spend many
 waking hours thinking about everything and finally, researching newer and
 newer technologies to present your ideas. If u don't have hobbies, kewl ideas
 and your own opinion, there ain't reason to stay and live here. If u have
 dummy head, then u don't give this hellish world youself and so u aren't
 important. But if u have anything POSSITIVE to show this world u aren't sucker,
 then show it to everyone u can and as fast as u can. Maybe, u can become real
 friend for someone. Do everything what u think's right until u can, until u
 have power and life to do it. Perhaps, after many years will be behind us,
 after u'll turn back and see things u did, u won't feel shame to them. And
 that's the possitive.

 Heh, did u expect, that this article will turn to this? :) Yeah, I was really
 st0ned when I wrote this, but oppositelly to weed, these ideas will stay here
 in my (and hope that also in your) brain forever. Think about it and think
 about yourself. Give to this shitty world anything possitive, albeit there r
 still less and less ppl, which can do that. Enter the new millennium with
 better ideas than your "pseudo-friends" have. Don't be lamer!


 That's everything, I wanted to say u. See ya...
