  Currently we only have one distribution site, which is our very own
homepage. If you want to be a distribution site for 29A Magazine, donate
webspace, domain name(s), etc., please mail us at:

                                29A@coderz.net

Our current homepage and only distribution site is:

                          http://www.coderz.net/29A

Thanks to Evul for hosting us.

  We haven't included a list of BBSs which distribute 29A Magazine, primarily
because almost nobody calls BBSs anymore, but also because we haven't got a
clue which BBSs are still up and running and which are not.If you run a BBS
and want to distribute 29A Magazine, please mail us at the above mentioned
E-mail address, we'd be very pleased to include your BBS in the next issue of
29A Magazine.
