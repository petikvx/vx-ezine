  29A Magazine issue 4 only includes a single viewer, a Win32 viewer, which is
coded by GriYo/29A. There is no DOS viewer in 29A Magazine issue 4 and it's
very doubtful that DOS viewer(s) will return in the future issues of 29A
Magazine.

  29A Magazine issue 4 doesn't include a screensaver. We know we promised
to do our very best to make sure the screensaver returned in future
issues of 29A Magazine, but we had a change of heart. We realized there is no
need for a screensaver, since it's already built in to Windows. It's very
doubtful the screensaver will return in the future issues of 29A Magazine.
