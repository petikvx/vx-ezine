  29A Magazine issue 3 did not include a secret game as we didn't have the
time to code either a little game or a little thing for the secret area.
We promised we'd do our very best to make sure the secret area returned in
the future issues of 29A Magazine.

  We've kept this promise and as a result the secret area is back in 29A
Magazine issue 4.

  The passwords for 29A Magazine issue 1 and 2, can be found in the "Secret
area" article in 29A Magazine issue 3.
