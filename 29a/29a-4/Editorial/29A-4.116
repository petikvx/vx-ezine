 As a new member I'd like to say something like retrieval under my  vx crea-
 tion and such	stuff. From here  I might send some greetz to all vx  coders
 who helped me to get on this position, especilly for us, 29A team.

 About my sight
 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
 For my part I think I have coded some interesting technics in vx world  but
 could it be better ? Heh. As you know I do NOT use any optimalization, many
 comments and my sources are big.

 Firstly, I'd like my work was for common vx coders, I fight for lucidity in
 our articles and sources. I also do not use optimalization because I  think
 it is needless already, think what you want.  

 Yes, my sources are big, when I've released them, some vxers were terrified
 Maybe they think themselves it can't work but it isn't true. Perhaps I will
 pull oneself up.


 That's all what I wanted to say, so don't forget:
		* We aren't spreading viruses, but knowledge *
