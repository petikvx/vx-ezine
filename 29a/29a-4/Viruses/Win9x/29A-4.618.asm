;We, Benny and Darkman, would like to introduce u the worlds first native
;Win2000/EPO/fast mid PE infector. We present u the first Win2k virus, even
;before the official releasion of Win2000; the platform which was designed to
;be uninfectable by viruses (as M$ guys often say). This virus is also the first
;one, which is able to infect MSI files. It searches the all content of actual
;disk for files and randomly infects them. Virus can infect up to 18 extensions
;(we won't list them here, just look at the end of this source), so it can be
;also called as mega-infector X-D. Virus doesn't enlarge the files, nor touchs
;any items in PE header. It's able to put itself to the holes inside the files
;left by some compilers and patch the host code, so next time the virus code
;will be executed as the first. Virus also uses CRC32 instead of stringz, so it
;saves many bytes and makes itself undetectable by all current (x-mas 1999) AVs.
;The virus is very optimized and doesn't contain any payload. This virus can
;run only under Win2000. Virus doesn't infect system files, nor files protected
;by SFC - using Win2k SfcIsFileProtected API (that's why it can't run on another
;system than Win2000).

;Microsoft Windows Installer - the facts
;ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ
;
;
;Have u ever think about the format, in which the installation files on
;internet r served? Usually it is one .exe file, created by the InstallShield
;Wizard, WinZIP SFX module or another similar programs. Microsoft knew that and
;so l8r decided to make its own standard of installation files. Microsoft made
;the MSI - MicroSoft Installer file format. MSI is hybrid of everything what
;microsoft ever made. MSI can contain VB scripts, binaries (e.g. PE), documents,
;resources and other shitz. The Win2000.Installer is able to infect PE files
;inside the MSI by simple searching. If the MSI contains any PE files (and it
;often contains), then there is 1:2 possibility the PE file will be infected.
;Microsoft also doesn't calculate any checksum of the files inside MSIs, so
;there ain't any problem with modification of MSI.
;Becoz Microsoft still hasn't published the file format of MSIs, we couldn't
;make better research (adding scripts, infection by VB and such things), than
;just code PE infector. We expect big boom with infection of MSI (its brand
;new EXECUTABLE file format), mainly after someone will publish the structure
;of MSIs. Until that, we can't do more.
;Yeah, and the last good news. Programs, which will want to carry the "Designed
;for Microsoft Windows" logo (there r plenty firms which wanna get it), will
;have to release the instalation program in MSI form. Even the MSI SDK is
;available only in MSI form. Office2000 and MSIE 5.x also use MSI files. We
;have the full support of Microsoft!!!

;Win2K.Inta
;
;It is not a dangerous nonmemory resident parasitic Windows virus. The virus is
;Win2000 specific and does not work under any other Windows version. 
;When run the virus searches for PE EXE files in the subdirectory tree on the
;current drive, then infects them. While infecting the virus looks for unused
;"cave" of code in the file, overwrites it with its code and patches the file
;entry address with a JMP_Virus instruction. As a result, affected files do not
;grow in length, and their functionality is not lowered. 
;
;The virus infects not only Windows executable files that have ".EXE" filename
;extension, but also: 
;
; .ACM .AX .CNV .COM .CPL .DLL .DRV .EXE .MPD .OCX .PCI .SCR 
; .SYS .TSP .TLB .VWP .WPC

;W2K.Installer.1676 
;
;Detected as: W2K.Installer.1676 
;Aliases: WIN2K/Insta 
;Known Variants: W2K.Installer.1688 
;Infection Length: 1,676 bytes and 1,688 bytes 
;Likelihood: Rare 
;Detected on: Jan 5, 2000 
;Characteristics: Windows 2000 
;
;Description 
;
;W2K.Installer virus is the first known virus to replicate only under Windows
;2000. This virus is not known to be in the wild at this time. There are two
;known variants of this virus as of Jan 5, 2000. They are named
;W2K.Installer.1676 and W2K.Installer.1688. 
;
;Although this virus may be referred as a Windows 2000 specific virus, it does
;not use any Windows 2000 specific functionality to replicate [* Not so, the
;SfcIsFileProtected is Win2000 specific *]. It spreads only under Windows 2000
;because the virus checks the version of Windows before it propagates.
;
;W2K.Installer is a cavity infector and will not change the file size of the
;infected files. The virus will first search through the code section to find
;an unused portion that is large enough for the virus to overwrite. These
;sections are usually filled with '0xCC' or '0x90' byte values [* Not to
;mention the 0x00 byte value*]. When the unused portion is located, the virus
;will overwrite its code into the 'cavity' and place a JMP (0xe9) instruction
;pointing to the start of the virus body into the entry point code. 
;
;The infection happens randomly, but the virus always infects applications with
;an MSI' extension. 
;
;MSI is a part of the Windows 2000 installation kit. The virus avoids infecting
;files that are protected by SFC (System File Checker). It marks infected files
;by modifying the 'MinorLinkerVersion' field of the PE header to 0x29. 
;
;The virus contains the following text in the virus code: 
;
;[Win2000.Installer] by Benny/29A & Darkman/29A
;
;W2K.Installer does not use any specific Windows 2000 functionality to replicate
;[* Again the SfcIsFileProtected is Win2000 specific *] and it fails to do so
;under some beta and RC versions [* Correct, RC1 and the beta releases before
;RC1 *] of Windows 2000. The virus is unique because of the way it infects
;files. Similar cavity infection methods were used in older DOS viruses and
;virus writers are starting to adapt it again in order to avoid being detected
;by first generation heuristic analyzers.

;
;This is a virus specifically for the Windows 2000 operating system however it

;known as 29A. 
;
;Files of several different extensions are sought during the infection routine
;besides the typical EXE, DLL and SCR. For example .DRV, .MPD and .OCX are

;Virus type: Win2k 
;Aliases: Installer 
;Known Variants: .1676,.1688 
;Infected objects: PE_EXE  
;Like Hood: Less Likely 
;Detection added: 06-01-2000 
;
;Description: 
;
;This is the first Windows 2000 specific virus. Thus most of its code is Win32
;compliant, the virus contains a check that makes it do nothing under operating
;systems with version smaller than 5 (Win2000). The only part that really depends
;on Win2k is the .MSI infection part - this is the new Installer technology
;Microsoft included in Win2k (and is also available on earlier versions of
;Windows). The virus will pseudo-infect .MSI files in a very simple but effective
;way - it will map the file in memory and look for an embedded executable file
;inside. If one is found (all .MSIs should have at least one) the virus will try
;to locate a cave of do-nothing code (NOP and INT3) inside the executable body
;and overwrite this section with its own code. Using this method, the virus will
;also be able to infect ANY executable file embedded in the .MSI file (which is
;an OLE2 file) - for instance, if there's a .CAB file inside the .MSI file and
;one executable inside the CAB file is not compressed, the virus will also be
;able to infect it. This raises serious problems concerning the detection of
;such infectors - the only way to detect it is to parse the all the embedded
;objects inside the file. Because the virus overwrites parts of the host code
;infected programs may not run normally or even crash when executed.
; 
;Technical details: 
;
;Technically speaking, the virus uses already known ways to infect PE executable
;files. When executing an infected file, the virus will scan for the kernel base,
;then try to import the following 17 APIs, using checksums computed on API names:
;
;FindFirstFileA, FindNextFileA, FindClose, SetFileAttr, SetFileTime, 
;CreateFileA, CreateFileMapping, MapViewOfFile, UnmapViewOfFile, 
;CloseHandle, GetTickCount, GetVersion, GetCurrentDirectory, 
;SetCurrentDirectory, LoadLibrary, GetProcAddress
;
;Then it will look for files in the root folder and sub-directories for files
;with the extension matching one of the following:
;
;.ACM, .AX, .CNV, .COM, .CPL, .DLL, .DRV, .EXE, .MPD, .OCX, .PCI, .SCR, .SYS 
;.TSP, .TLB, .VWP, .WPC, .MSI
;
;For such files, the virus will map the file in memory to ease the infection
;process. Then it will check if the respective file is a PE executable file. If
;so, it will call the infection routine - this will look for a cave of 0x90/0xCC
;large enough to hold the virus body, write the body in there and modify the
;entry point to execute the virus code first. Then, for MSI files, the virus will
;check if the respective file is an OLE2 file. If so, it will search inside the
;file for a PE executable file embedded and infect it. The number of infected
;files per execution is randomly selected - the virus contains a random number
;generator routine which will decide if it will infect more files or just return
;the control to the original code of the host.
;
;The virus also contains the following string, not used in any way:

;Windows 2000 virus: Stunt or preview?
;
;
;January 17, 2000
;Web posted at: 9:57 a.m. EST (1457 GMT)
;
;by Stan Miastkowski
;
;(IDG) -- The discovery this week of the first computer virus that works
;specifically with Windows 2000 initially brought questions about the
;soon-to-be-unveiled operating system's security.
;
;But experts who have taken a closer look at the virus, officially dubbed
;W2K.Installer.1676, say it doesn't take advantage of any potential security
;holes. In fact, it's a relatively conventional file virus that only infects
;Windows 2000 for the simple reason that it checks to see which OS it's running
;on, and spreads only if it's Windows 2000.
;
;The virus isn't in actual circulation yet, nor do virus researchers expect it
;to ever be. Research labs found out about W2K.Installer.1676 when it was sent
;to them, apparently by its author. In addition, it lacks a damage-causing
;payload. The only thing it does is spread itself.
;
;Despite the virus being characterized as "rare," major antivirus software
;makers say their existing packages will detect W2K.Installer.1676 because of
;the way it works, although they plan to add specific protection against it in
;their next virus signature updates.
;
;Vincent Weafer, director of the Symantec Antivirus Research Center, says that
;W2K.Installer.1676 may simply be a "proof of concepts," a typical
;first-generation virus where the dark fraternity of (mainly male) virus
;writers explore a new OS, looking for holes or just proving that they can
;write a virus that works only with that OS, which they were able to do in
;this case.
;
;Or it may just be an ego thing, according to Weafer, with the author wanting
;to be the first to write a Windows 2000 virus.
;
;
;No antivirus magic in W2K
;
;While Weafer says that Windows 2000 is "overall a more secure operating
;system," he says that users still need to be careful, because most viruses
;that can infect Windows 98 and NT can also infect the new OS.
;
;Under the hood, W2K.Installer.1676 is what's known as a "cavity infector," a
;common type of virus that looks through files to find unused spaces in the
;code. When it finds a space big enough, it inserts itself in the file. And
;because it doesn't actually change the size of the file, it attempts to work
;around the "heuristic" protection in most antivirus software, which looks for
;unexpected changes in the sizes of files.
;
;In one way, W2K.Installer.1676 is almost a step back to reusing earlier virus
;technology in a new context. Cavity infectors were widely used in early DOS
;viruses, but fell out of favor with virus writers.
;
;When asked about Microsoft's reaction to W2K.Installer.1676, a spokesperson
;said it's nothing but "a publicity stunt." She added that "a virus is by
;definition just an application that does something malevolent, and Windows
;2000 runs applications." [* hahaha, so where's that security u talked about?! *]
