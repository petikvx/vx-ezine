	Open Handle does almost the same as Handle by Mark Russinovich but 
contains no code from that program. The main difference is that our Open Handle 
is open source. This program writes names and values of all open handles of all 
running processes in the system. Main program is written in Delphi 6 + asm. 
Driver is written in C.
