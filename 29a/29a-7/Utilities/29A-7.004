===========
| PREFACE |
===========

hello, I'm Mauro Meneghin, but you can call me Gildo

what I have created is not a single backdoor!

something much more!

this is an universal backdoor generator!!! lol

yes, it is,

Gbkdoor (that stay for "Gildo backdoor Generator")
inserts the opcodes of the backdoors that I created
into the executable that you want!

nothing new now?
mhm, I'm not sure, but still wait and listen

THIS BACKDOOR GENERATOR DON'T INCREASE THE SIZE OF
THE INFECTED PROGRAM!

how do this?

eheh, it (else I, becouse I done it) discover
chunks of unused opcodes inside the program to infect!

so before and after that the program become infected
the size will not change, and the admin will not see
noone difference in the filesize! This is a foundamental thing

ok, I am aware that I have had a great idea, it's true

btw, there isn't much space inside the executable 
where I can write opcodes, and these chunks are
often more then 3, but usually not more then 13 bytes in size,
so it's not possible to put in it big things without increasing 
the size of the executable!


btw, currently (in version 1.0) it can insert 2 kind of backdoor:

list1: that only execute a command passed as argument at a given position 
list2: that before of executing it make a setuid(0) to get root privileges

I'll add others possibilityes in the future

btw be careful when you infect a program, I recomand you to make a copy,
so you can restore the original in the future

another thing I recomend is to don't create damage, becouse I (the author)
have written this code only for accademical purpouses, and I disapprove 
malware things, else it will be only your responsability

===================
| HOW TO USE THIS |
===================

first of all consider to be root if you want to write 
over common executable like ones in /bin

already exist an executable of Gbkdoor in this package,
if it don't works, delete it first and then type make

now you are ready for use it

think to a program that you'd like to infect and than 
give it as argument to Gbkdoor like this:

root# Gbkdoor /usr/sbin/sendmail

this will ask you what kind of infection you want to do,
becouse sendmail is a suidroot program you can choose 
to use the list2 backdoor!

root# ls -l /usr/sbin/sendmail
-r-sr-sr-x    1 root     bin        369704 Jun  3  2001 /usr/sbin/sendmail
root#

ok, the backdoor is been installed successfully!
now from normal user you can execute albitrary command with 
root privileges, see

root# su Gildo

Gildo$ /usr/sbin/sendmail 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 /usr/bin/id
uid=0(root) gid=100(users) egid=0(root) groups=100(users)
Gildo$

ok, this is all, you can execute programs you wants with root
privileges, only type like this:

Gildo$ program_trojanized 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <program_you_want> [arguments [...]]


so remember to write number between 1 and 10, before and <program_you_want>
must be exactly as the 11-th argument, else you'll segfault
or if you give less then 11 arguments the original program will start,
like if it's not trojanized!


NOTE: every error you do can go in a segmentation fault, 
becouse I haven't had space to catch 'exceptions',
so don't do things that you are not allowed to do for permissions
and give always the name of the program to execute with full path!

this is all, enjoy it
