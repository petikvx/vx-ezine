                                -----------

     In the  beginning  viruses used  time  triggered events based in local
 time, but today the World Wide Web has  spread over  the entire planet and
 worms  infects  computers  in many different time zones, so relying in the
 current system time for global syncronized events is incorrect.
     Correctly  time  measuring  can  lead  to very effective DDOS attacks,
 causing panic at earth level, like  that  root nameserver query flood that
 stopped big part of the internet for some hours.
     There are many  types  of time servers  on the internet, the most used
 protocol is the SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol).

     So i had coded two functions to easy handle SNTP:

     DWORD __stdcall sntp_getftime(char *szIpAddr, FILETIME *ft);
     DWORD __stdcall sntp_getstime(char *szIpAddr, SYSTEMTIME *st);

     where:
       szIpAddr = pointer to string containing an IP four dotted address.
       ft = pointer to FILETIME structure that will receive the UTC time.
       st = pointer to SYSTEMTIME structure that will receive the UTC time.

     returns: 0 on success.

     These functions  will get the UTC time  from the server and convert it
 to  the specified Win32 structure. You can  convert UTC time to local time
 using common Win32 time management functions upon these structures.
