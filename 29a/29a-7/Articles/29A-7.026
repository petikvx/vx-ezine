
hello boys, I'm Gildo [mmeneghin@inwind.it]
this little code is an example of how is possible
to write an exploit suitable for a vulnerability
of another program ;-)
I have inserted this code inside my Dama game, but perhaps
that one is boring, so look this littler piece.

files are:
  
  vulnerable.c	is the vulnerable program that run on the victim host,
		vulnerable send the address of the buffer to overflow, lol!
		this is a really stupid thing perhaps, becouse usually
		exploiting common services you can only suppose the address
		where to jump, I made so becouse I don't care,
		althought you can easily send formatted exploit string
		with supposed addresses until you find the right one,
		or better you can insert at the beginning some nop (0x90)
		that will save you if you fall in that gap.
  --------------
  exploit.s	is the exploit written in AT&T, sorry if you don't like,
		is executed inside a buffer of vulnerable, 
		so on the remote host, and do simply this:
	-fork() and parent exit so vulnerable don't stay in a suspened state 
	-create socket and initialize a struct sockaddr_in, with the
		IP and PORT of my prompttelnet program (see later)
	-connect to prompttelnet program
	-redirect the stdin to a socket sock_in, and stdout and stderr to
		sock_out. Note that I used close and fcntl(really I used 
		dup2 in another exploit and it's better, eheh
		I don't want to rewrite without a reason)
	-execve a shell, so you'll be happy	
  --------------
  attack.c	is the program that attacks the vulnerable, this means that
		do two things:
	-ask the address of buffer to overflow
	-send a formatted exploiting string to vulnerable that is
		the exploit code that I over told, but differs in
		some parameters as: *IP where is running prompttelnet
		                    *PORT where is tunning prompttelnet
				    *ADDRESS of buffer to overflow in memory
				    *some padding bytes
  --------------
prompttelnet.s	is the program that interface the shell executed on the remote
		host, so you'l type commands here and they will be executed 
		on the remote host.
		start prompttelnet where you want, typically on the same 
		machine where you start attack
		
		
=========================
HOW MAKE I WORK ALL THIS?

first start the vulnerable program or make it start from someone else (remotelly),
second start the prompttelnet program (locally if you want)
third start the attack in this way:
  attack <IP of vulnerable> <PORT of vulnerable> <IP of promptelnet> <PORT of prompttelnet>

NOTE_1:
    you can start all 3 programs on the same computer, but you cannot have a 0
    in <IP of prompttelnet> and <PORT of prompttelnet>
NOTE_2:
    you can try the exploit directly without attack, just running:
    -prompttelnet
    -exploit
    on the same computer, it'll use default IP=127.0.0.1 and PORT 18002 18003
NOTE_3:
    I'm sure you'll like to write exploits, I'll give you the file
    dump that is a perl script that I use to grap opcodes with comments in asm
    into C files
NOTE_4:
    I wrote this code only becouse I was curious of seeing how work these things,
    but I know I wrote a very lame thing, and this is only a demo that
    gives some ideas, not the end purpouse of something at all,
    sure you'll try more advanced things, tell me about them if you want
    
bye, becouse sizeof(README) is becoming bigger of sizeof(code) ;-)
