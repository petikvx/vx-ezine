  29A magazine issue 7 does not contain any viewer. Maybe after the  magazine
has been released an additional package with the viewer will  be released. In
the case the viewer is released sepparately  it will have the features listed
here:

  Viewer would be an  improved version  of the Win32  viewer from 29A issue 6 
which is coded  by GriYo/29A  and  it doesn't  include a  screensaver because
Windows already has.

  It's recommended a resolution of, at least, 800x600.

  The viewer is able to play a MP3 located in \CONFIG\MUSIC.MP3. If you don't
like the MP3 we've included change it at your pleasure.

  There aren't available parameters or commands for the viewer being designed
to be used with a mouse.

  The viewer is able to manage URLs. You will need RICHED20.DLL for this.

  "Boss key": click in the skull in the task bar.
