techno/peasants - have to assume responsibility for it."

Today's society is moving more and more towards a technology based
civilization.  We depend on computers for even the simplest of tasks.  Losses
of information can be tragic, not to mention devastating.  While computer
systems are becoming more advanced, computer viruses are also becoming more
sophisticated.  Anti-virus software has a niche in the technology market, based
on claims that it can find and eradicate viruses on a computer system.  The
industry bases itself on society's intense fear of viruses and sets themselves
as a necessary element in the software market.  The need for anti-virus
software is created by the media hype of virus damage.
                                                        
In 1988, the Mirriam-Webster dictionary called 'computer virus' its word of the
year.  A computer virus is a program that replicates.  The program's code
contains a set of instructions that are executed by the computer when an
infected program is accessed.  The virus must also spread itself, whether by
propagation through an email client, through a chat program such as IRC
(Internet Relay Chat) or by simply copying itself to another file.  Viruses are
parasites.  They might not cause harm, they just have to spread.  (Kane:3-4)

Anti-virus software is a bigger business than writing viruses.  Most anti-virus
programs scan files looking for viruses.  They refer to a database which
keeps "fingerprints" of known bits of virus code.  If the virus and file codes
match, they alert the user to a potential viral infection.  Most are able to
disinfect the file by removing the virus' code.  However, an anti-virus program
is only as good as its updates.  There is a strong business in viral software
updates. (Schneider 154:155)


"You can't trust your best friend's software any more than you can trust his or
her bodily fluids - safe software or no software at all!"
                                                                Andrew Ross


One of the greatest fears today is catching a computer virus.  With the
transmission of information, it's no wonder that Dennis Miller, from Saturday
Night Live, remarked "Remember, when you connect with another computer, you're
connecting to every computer that computer has ever connected to" (Ross).  
During the Michelangelo panic in 1992, AP writer Laura Myers wrote "Do you know
where that floppy disk has been?  Taking a page from safe sex manuals, experts
are warning computer users to practice safe computing" (Kane:205).  

Anti-virus software play on the media's hype and people's fear for publicity.  
The US National Computer Security Association (NCSA) estimated that in 1996 the
costs of viruses to US companies and organizations was between $2 billion and
$3 billion, up from approximately $1 billion in 1995 (Shimpton and
Bissett:900).  The fear was very real with the Michelangelo virus.  
Michelangelo, which debuted in 1992, was arguably the first large-scale virus
infestation to computers.  "This is one of the most widespread viruses.  It's
out there in a large way and could cause lots of damage if it isn't stopped,"
claimed John McAfee (Kane:206).

McAfee is a self-stylized virus guru who actively uses the media to promote his
own products.  It has been argued that he used the hype surrounding the
Michelangelo virus to further his own gains in the anti-virus software world.  
He claimed that anywhere from 50,000 to 5 million computers were infected with
the virus.  "When stories about the virus reached the popular press, the hype
was truly unleashed. Reporters and newsgroups sprouted previously
unknown "experts" on the virus, spreading even more misinformation" (Gordon,
Ford and Wells).        
                
McAfee gave away free copies of his version of an anti-virus software to show
awareness for the problem.  With more and more users using his product, his
name developed into that of a industry expert (Kane:201).  On March 2, four
days before the Michelangelo virus was to strike, he went on the Today Show and
announced "There are over a million systems infected now" (Kane:204).  He also
told AP that "This is one of the most widespread viruses.  It's out there in a
big way and could cause lots of damage it if isn't stopped" (Kane:206).  
Symantic, makers of Norton Utilities, scored a publicity coup with the
publishing of a full page ad advertising free virus-removal
software.  "Representatives from antivirus firms -- some of them employed in
marketing departments - called Michelangelo a 'very serious threat'"
(Rosenburger).

While other anti-virus software makers profited from the hype, McAfee was the
real winner.  In an AP report, Bart Ziegler wrote "The reports often failed to
mention that many projections of potential damage were provided by companies
that make anti-viral software and stood to benefit from the scare.  One source
was John McAfee of McAfee Associates, the largest seller of virus-killing
programs.  McAfee was widely quoted as saying Michelangelo had infected up to 5
million computers worldwide.  Asked Friday whether he had overstated his case,
he said the low rate of actual Michelangelo damage was due partly to
precautions so many PC users took" (Kane:208).  In the end, there is no
conclusive report as to how many computers were really infected.  500 computers
were shipped from a warehouse carrying the virus.  However, it was not the data
disaster is was expected to be.  IBM claimed it erased data on only two of its
250,000 computers around the world (Kane:209).

One must decide who is to blame for the hype and let-down.  Is it the media or
the software makers who are responsible for the consequences?  The media are
always anxious for a hot new story.  Viruses are exciting to the public.  
Images of viruses stealthily creeping into a personal area are very
seductive.  "It was an amazing display of media power", says Robert
Rosenburger, an expert on virus hoaxes.  "'The anti-virus companies have to take
some of the blame,' he said, 'But the main responsibility for the scare falls
on the media'" (Lemos)

Jon Callas, a security specialist, doesn't agree with Rosenberger's claim that
the anti-virus industry is driven by hysteria.  He says many users suffer from
acute computer hypochondria - the belief that their computer has contracted
every virus out there. Rosenburger, on the other hand, maintains the
website "http://www.vmyths.com".   He publicly ridicules corporations, the
media and vendors for their stances on computer viruses whenever he can.  
According to him, there are plenty of opportunities.  "'This is not a labour of
love, so let's call it a labour of anger,' he says" (Sibley).    Vmyths.com
serves a purpose because "while there is a real threat from viruses, it often
isn't as bad as what some people would like it to be.  And it isn't just the
anti-virus industry - it's that these scares make good stories" (Sibley).

AP was the first newspaper to critique the motives of anti-virus software.  On
March 20, 1992, Larry Blasko wrote "Snake oil salesmen aren't dead.  They've
just reprogrammed their pitch.  If you believe what you saw in the media in
early March, the computerized world was going to end on March 6 when the
computer virus Michelangelo would destroy data on disk drives from Kalamazoo to
Katmandu.  All was domed on the 517th anniversary of the artist's birth.  But
wait.  Maybe you were one of the lucky people who owned or could buy virus
protection software.  Which, by great coincidence, just happened to be on
sale..." (Kane:209-210).

Anti-virus software companies are not immune to their own social agendas.  
The media is a powerful tool in today's society.  Technogeeks often keep up with
the latest trends in software and programming by reading the latest industry
publications.  Rating software is very popular and is often prominently
featured.  In 1993, PC Magazine, a Ziff-Davis publication, rated Cental Point
Software and Norton/Symantic as the industry's best products.  However, the
criteria was based on the largest advertisers.  Central Point Software and
Norton/Symantic were two of PC Magazine's biggest advertising clients.  Their
sales swelled with the "Editors' Choice" award for best anti-virus software
(Kane:213).

Anti-virus companies are concerned with preserving their good images.  This may
not be in the public's best interest.  Good viruses are written by talented
computer programmers.  Although they may be written for a joke or to test their
programming skills, the damage that they cause is very real.  Virus writers can
work on behalf of the software companies, helping to come up with better and
sharper methods of detection.  However, with so many different software
companies competing for the number one spot in the security sector, they may
compromise morals.  Says one former virus writer: "In the end, the one standing
reason for them not to hire me that I really couldn't reject was that if any
one company hired me, all the others would sick their marketing droids on
them 'exposing' the fact that I once wrote viruses, generating public relations
problems for my new employer" (Coderz).

Anti-virus software is necessary as a general rule.  New viruses are being
written every day, while old ones continue to make their rounds.  However, the
companies must be honest with the people.  Common sense should prevail over
hysteria.  The software companies should concentrate on identifying real
threats, while the media should be honest with the public over the nature of
the virus scares.
