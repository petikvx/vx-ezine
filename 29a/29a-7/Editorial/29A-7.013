
Last words from Benny

dear readers, virus writters, friends and enemies,

I've been thinking about this step for very long time. I wasn't sure if the
right time already became, if I still have anything to give to the VX scene
and if the VX scene still have anything to give to me. I decided to abandon
my  virtual existency  in VX scene  under a "Benny"  handle. I  decided  so
because of many reasons that I will try to briefly explain here to you.

I've learnt A LOT and I've got a feeling a scene  cannot give me a more. by
the last years the VX scene seems to be dying  and I can't do anything with
it. primitive shits are flooding the  Internet and it seems nothing's gonna
change at this point. there  are still a lot of  people that are interested
in spreading and making  damages rather  than advanced  technical  stuff of
viral infiltrations  programming, which is imo much more interesting. every
year  there are  less profesional  virus  writters  and almost noone new is
filling an empty space. friends  I've got thru  virus programming got worse
or I've lost them. I  VERY revere  those friendships  that last for 5 years
I'm on the scene.

I've got very cool job where I can really realise myself. I spend whole day
in front of computer and I don't want to spend more time apart of the work.
the life is also about something else than this. those  teenager times when
I could sit at the monitor screen even whole weekend are already away.

many people think that I  code viruses only because of publicity  and fame.
that's not true! if it would be, I'd  already leave the  scene at the first
year being in 29A (I already  appeared in newspapers), because that time my
ego should already be satisfied. I've been always very much more interested
in technical stuff rather than reading  about myself in some stupid article
in some stupid newspapers. even it is hard to believe, this is truth. those
ones who don't believe this just envy or have wrong informations about me.

the last thing that influenced my  opinion if I  should leave or  not was a
fascistic behavior of Darkman aka Johnlw on #virus channel on undernet.org.
after a  releasion of  article in New  York  Times  Magazine  where a  word
"benny" appeared a few times he asked me to leave a channel and to not join
anymore. he is high-op, he  is the leader, he is right.  Darkman used to be
my best friend on the channel, in  times when I was  on the beginning of my
VX career. those  times are away. now the  channel administrates a guy that
hadn't wrote  a single line  of code for  many years and only fucks people.
that's  a  pity. however  he  can stick "his"  channel  together  with  his
problems in his arse.

I will  stay using  my nickname  on Internet,  in a real  world  many of my
friends don't call me any other way. I  can't stipulate in a future I won't
write and  publish any  new code. if  there  will  be an inspiration that I
don't have right  now. everything  I've ever  wanted to  code I've  already
coded. all my goals  I wanted to reach I already reached, not everybody can
say this  and I am very  glad for that. it  will be nice surprise if I will
publish  something in  next 29A  magazine. and  it will  be better than big
disappointment  if I would  stay in the  scene and  do nothing,  like  many
others do.

here I would like to THANK all my REAL friends that I've found in the scene
by that long time. and  also thank  29A for  giving me  opportunity to show
what's  inside me. I'm very  glad for that. honestly  I can  say  that I've
spent one of the best times in my life right in the VX scene and I wouldn't
ever change it for anything. it was a  big fun, it  was big learning and it
was perfect. thank  you all that  really deserve it, you know very well who
you are. my  e-mail address  will stay valid  and if  anybody will  want to
contact me, he can do that. thanx to all for a big moral support!

good bye in better times!
