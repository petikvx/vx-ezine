  In VX scene:

  Since 29A  #6  was released  back in march of  2002 not  many things  have
happened in the vx scene.

  Several virus  magazines were announced and they finally became vaporware:
SLAM #5 that  was announced  back in march  2002 and  The  Knight  Templar's
Fantasy magazine are good examples.

  The creation  of some  groups  were  announced, element  or Team Fatum per
example, but they never grew up, and other groups disappeared, as Brigada 8.

  The scene has been  waiting IKX's Xine number  6 for a  long time but last
news tells that the zine will not be released, at least, on next 6 months.

  Several zines like Black Virus Group, Habitat, Brigada 8, In name of zero,
Natural Selection, Mitosis, RRLF or Coderz, Batch Zone were released in this
time.

  http://www.coderz.net was attacked for a long time and the domain had to be
  taken down working actually only http://coderz.net.

  Vx Heavens also went down and it's unknown if it will be back ever.

  David L. Smith was sentenced to 20 months of prision and Simon Vallor to 2
years.

  In january  2004 the most  spreaded  virus  ever  was released, it's name:
mydoom. Other worms like Slammer or Sobig had their 15 minutes of fame too.

  During these 2 years the production of macro virus and viruses in  general
have decreased really a lot. Actually antivirus software are more focused in
developing security suites (anti spam, firewalls, etc) than coding new anti-
virus techniques. More than half  of the stuff  which is added to  detection
databases is malware: backdoors, trojans, exploits, etc.

  Microsoft  destined 5 million  dollars for paying rewards in order  to get
information that  lead to arrest and  imprisonment of virus coders.  Rewards
for Blaster, mydoom or Sobig virus coders have been offered.

  Gigabyte was arrested some days before the release of this issue due virus
coding. She faces 3  years in prison and  a possible  fine up to  as much as
$167,000.
