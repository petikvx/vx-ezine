  Sorry for the delay but  here we are one more time. Some people had buried
us already but we are still alive and kicking more balls than ever.

  29A came to the vx scene back in 1996 so we have been  around for 8 years.
That's a lot of time considering most of vx groups only are around from 1 to
3 years usually.

  In these 8 years we've earned with  hard work of  members and contributors
the respect and admiration of the vx scene and also from other people out of
the scene. 29A members are asked to reply  interviews and appear in security
conferences.

  Then is all the work done? Is time to retire?

  The answer to both  questions is a big NO. Our plans are to continue doing
things as until now. Well, not all things.

  We aren't happy because almost 2 years happened since our last release. We
decided to  release a new magazine every 1st january  whatever the amount of
stuff we have. Quantity is not important, quality is.

  With this in mind we look forward to see you again in  some months reading
29A #8.
