	1 - About the biological version
	--------------------------------

	The disease  hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS),  is characterized
by an initial  fever followed  by the abrupt onset of acute pulmonary edema
and shock.  After recognition of the initial cases  by observant clinicians
in the Southwest, investigations  were  swiftly mounted by local university
and public health workers but, in spite of efficient and competent studies,
failed to find the cause.  By the time the CDC became involved, a number of
possible  causative  agents  had  been  ruled  out,  leading  most  of  the
investigators  to  believe  they  were  dealing with  a  new  entity.  This 
observation  led  to a broadly based approach to the field epidemiology and
the laboratory study of the disease.  Samples from the field investigations 
were distributed  among many different  laboratories of the National Center
for  Infectious Disease (NCID) for analysis by  the  most sensitive classic 
and  modern  molecular  biological  tests  for  a  wide  range  spectrum of
infectious agents.

Somewhat   surprisingly,   successful    results   were    obtained   after
only  a  few  days  of  straightforward serologic  tests for  hantaviruses.
The hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia and shock  observed  in some of the
patients  had raised  speculation  about the  involvement  of  these  viral
agents  however they  had been previously  known  as associated  with renal
syndromes only. The  serologic  results  came from  established  techniques
such   as   indirect   fluorescent-antibody    assays   and   enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays. The  next  steps utilized reverse  transcription  and
PCR  amplification  of  RNA in postmortem tissue  samples (60% of confirmed
cases to date have been fatal), using  consensus  primers  based  on  known
hantavirus RNA sequences. These yielded  products with sequences typical of
hantavirus but  clearly different  from any known member of the genus. This
provided  additional evidence for  the  hantavirus etiology  and linked the
new hantavirus closely  to the human disease by its presence in the tissues
of people dying  of the infection. Using  the  genomic sequences from human
tissues, investigators were  subsequently able to implicate  the deer mouse
as the principle reservoir of the virus.

Hantaviruses  have traditionally  been difficult to propagate, and this one
was no exception. Thus  a full-length  cDNA  clone of the small RNA segment
of the virus was synthesized. This technique provided  a diagnostic reagent
of  increased sensitivity that  could be made widely available. Eventually,
full length  RNA  sequences were  developed  for the  medium  segment and a
partial  sequence  was  determined for the  large  segment, permitting  the
definitive  determination  that the new  virus, isolated  weeks  later  and
registered  as  Muerto Canyon virus, was not  a  reassortant  of  any known
hantavirus.

Immunohistochemical identification  of  hantavirus  antigens  and  in  situ
hybridization   with   genomic  sequences  also  confirmed  the  hantavirus
etiology of the syndrome. The  extensive presence  of  antigen in pulmonary
capillaries provided  an  explanation for the  pathophysiology  and  target
organ  specificity  differing from  that  of  other  known  disease-causing
hantaviruses. This method, when  applied  to paraffin-imbedded tissues, has
also  served as a retrospective diagnostic tool, firmly  identifying  fatal
cases from 10 to 15 years ago.

The rapid  recognition  of  the  hantavirus etiology  of  this  disease was
important in that  it alleviated heightened fear among the general American
population, and saved lives  by focusing public  health  recommendations on
the avoidance  of  contact  with  potentially  infected  rodents. Different
hantaviruses  have  been  isolated in Louisiana, Florida  and  also Brazil,
indicating  the  uncommon, yet widespread nature of this disease. Recently
(Diglisic 1994), isolation  of  a  hantavirus from Mus musculus captured in
Yugoslavia was reported.

As stated by C.J. Peters, chief  of  the  Special Pathogens Branch  of  the
Division  of  Viral  and  Rickettsial Diseases at NCID, the crucial role of
modern  techniques  in  virology  was  possible  only in  a context of past
hantavirus research, and as part of efforts of a  multidisciplinary team of
clinicians, epidemiologists, field ecologists  and classic microbiologists.
The need for basic research is highlighted by the applied practical success
which  resulted from it, as was  the  case in identifying  a new  strain of
hantavirus.  Future   research  will  need  to  investigate  the  molecular
mechanisms for induction of  pulmonary  edema and  an  appropriate blocking
therapy. The evolutionary  relationships  of  the  hantaviruses  and  their
rodent  host specificity must be understood to predict the future course of
transmission, and  finally  the basis  for  the  different  tropisms of the
viruses must be examined at a molecular level.

	------------------------

	This virus is a research speciment.  It uses some system hacks that 
may not work under futere versions of Windows,  but for the moment it works 
nice on Windows95 and Windows98. Some of its characteristics are:

	2.1. Kernel scanning

	The virus traps  GP Faults  and scans system memory looking for the 
KERNEL32 base address.  After that if gets the address of VxDCall function.
The virus uses no other APIs at all. 

	2.2. Memory resident

	By means of  VMM PageReserve  and  PageCommit the virus allocates a
block  of  shared  memory  and  copies  its  body  there.   Then  it  hooks
VWIN32_Int21h_Dispatcher so all opened files will be infected.

	2.3. Stealth

	HPS  hooks  FindFirst  and  FindNext  functions  in  order  to hide
infected files true size.

	2.4. Retro

	Deletes anti-virus checksum databases.

	2.5. Polymorphic

	The  virus  uses  complex  polymorphic encryption  engine  to  hide
itself into infected files.   This decryptor will be generated during virus
installation (slow mutation).

	2.5. Payload

	On saturdays the virus  will flip  BMP  files  that  are  accessed,
included the ones hidden on .SYS extension (LOGO.SYS, WLOGO.SYS...).




	3 - Description from Datafellows
	--------------------------------

	NAME:  HPS
	ALIAS: Hanta, Win95/HPS
	TYPE:  Resident EXE -files

	HPS is a polymorphic Windows 95 virus which contains this text:

< Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) Virus BioCoded by GriYo / 29A >

HPS  stays active in memory  and  infects  Win32  EXE  files  as  they  are
accessed,  encrypting its  own code  with variable  polymorphic  encryption
layer.

HPS activates on  Saturdays.  If a non-compressed Windows bitmap (BMP) file
has been opened, the virus horizontally flips the picture.

HPS patches the  value  DEADBABE (in hex) to the  end of the bitmap  header
area to avoid flipping the same image again.   Since  non-compressed bitmap
files are  frequently  used by Windows 95 and 98, this  causes all kinds of
weird effects - such as the start-up and power-down screen of Windows being
"mirrorized". 




	4 - Description from AVP
	------------------------

	This  5124 bytes  virus is  a  Windows95/98  infector that installs
itself  into  the  Windows  kernel,  hooks system events  and  then affects
Portable Executable (PE) files that are accessed. The virus was named after
its "copyright" string that is visible in decrypted virus code:

< Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) Virus BioCoded by GriYo / 29A >

While  infecting a file  the virus increases size of last section, encrypts
its code by  polymorphic engine, writes encrypted result to the end of file
into the last section and modifies the address of entry point.  The size of
polymorphic decryption loop is variable, as a result size of infected files
grows by variable values.

The virus is slow polymorphic, that means  the polymorphic decryption  loop
code is not changed each time the virus infects a file.  Moreover, the same
infected file will produce  the same polymorphic  code while infecting next
files,  and all files that are infected before rebooting will have the same
decryption routine.  Only  next  "generation"  of  the  virus will  produce
polymorphic loop that differs with "parent" copy of the virus.

When an infected file is executed, the polymorphic decryption routine takes
control, restores virus  code  in  original form and jumps to  installation
routine.  The virus then scans Windows kernel  code to locate  KERNEL32.DLL
image, looks for  export table in there  and gets  VxDCall  routine address
from there.  The virus then uses this address to call disk access and other
routines in case of need.

The virus then installs itself into the Windows kernel:  allocates  a block
of memory  by  using  undocumented  Win32  VxD  services  provided  by  VMM
(PageReserve and PageCommit), copies  itself  to there, scans  the  VxDCall
handler in KERNEL32 code and patches it with address of its own handler. As
a  result the  virus installs  itself into the shared memory area and hooks
VxDCall.

To   prevent  General   Protection   while  scanning   Windows  memory  for
KERNEL32.DLL  image  (that can appear  when the virus  accesses  a part  of
memory that is not available for applications) the virus protects itself by
Structured  Exception  Handling (SEH).   This  also  does  its  work  as  a
anti-debugging trick.

The virus  detects its  already installed copy by a Are-You-Here?  call  by
GetDate  VxDCall with registers  ESI='HPS!'  and  EDI='TSR?', the installed
copy returns 'YES!' in ESI register.

The  virus  VxDCall  handler monitors  VWIN32_Int21Dispatch  calls only and
passes through any other calls. There are nine functions intercepted:

GetDate, Open ReadOnly, Open WriteOnly, FindFirst/Next with LongNames, 
Rename with LongName, Create/Open with LongName.

On file access calls  (open, rename)  the  virus  compares  the  file  name
extension  with EXE, SRC and SYS and infects them, if they are not infected
yet.   After infecting a  file the virus deletes the  anti-virus data files
ANTI-VIR.DAT, CHKLIST.MS, AVP.CRC, IVB.NTZ, if they exist.




	5 - News about HPS from Cable News Network
	------------------------------------------
	
	SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A. (NB)
	By Craig Menefee, Newsbytes.

	Panda  Software, a Spanish  security  software firm  that  recently
entered US  anti-virus markets, claims to have bagged  the first Windows 98
computer  virus before  the new operating  system upgrade has even hit  the
shelves.  Panda  says the  bug's  only apparent purpose is to insert itself
into Windows 98 files, wait until Saturdays and then invert the screen to a
mirror image when it activates.

Newsbytes notes several  crucial  authenticating  details were missing late
Wednesday, after the firm's European labs were closed for the day.

Asked  if  the virus is otherwise  damaging, Pedro Bustamante, president of
Panda  Software  USA  in  San Francisco, told  Newsbytes  the  virus  seems
intended more as a nuisance than  a  threat to computer users.  He said the
bug was detected first in Spain and is probably not yet "in the wild," that
is, spread beyond the initial release area.

Panda says the virus is polymorphic  and  encrypted by a scrambling routine
that changes patterns to elude detection.  When unscrambled, it  carries in
its  code  the letters "HPS".   Panda  says  the letters  are  an  apparent
reference  to Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, a viral disease transmitted by
rodents in the US.  Bustamante says the HPS virus also works on  Windows 95
platforms if  Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0  is installed on the machine.
Still, he adds, the bug  was  designed  specifically  for  Windows 98,  not
MS Internet Explorer 4.0.  Bustamante  told Newsbytes he  will provide some
further answers on  Thursday after the  Panda Software Virus Lab  opens  in
Spain. Questions to be answered include how the researchers know the bug is
targeted for Windows 98 rather than  Windows 95 or MSIE 4.0  as  a bug that
also happens to work under Windows 98.  Also he said he  would find out how
the virus gets transmitted from one machine to another.




	6 - News about HPS from InfoWorld Media Group
	---------------------------------------------

	June 22, 1998 (Vol. 20, Issue 25)
	Virus in Win98 beats OS shipping date

	The first  virus specifically written for  Microsoft Windows 98  is
shipping and available before the operating system itself: Windows 98 ships
June 25.

HPS (Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome) is a  32-bit  polymorphic Windows virus
that only  activates when the infected system is booted on a Saturday.  The
Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome for which the virus  is named is a biological
disease  transmitted  by  rodents.   Its  principal  symptom  is  an  acute
respiratory crisis. If activated, the computer virus flips any uncompressed
bitmaps horizontally, only on Saturdays.  This produces a  "mirror"  effect
for many of the screens used within the Windows operating system, according
to  Virus Bulletin, the Oxfordshire, England-based  technical  journal that
tracks viruses.

The virus was authored by GriYo, who is referred to as a "notorious member"
of the 29A virus-writing group, and is  credited  with writing  the complex
Implant virus, according to Virus Bulletin.

GriYo did make the virus  backward-compatible, though, so  Windows 95 users
need not upgrade to the new OS to experience the same effects.

Panda Software, based in Spain, has already added protection for this virus
into its anti-virus software.

According  to a Symantec representative, the company is awaiting its sample
of the virus and said all  anti-virus  companies would be adding protection
for this virus to their libraries shortly.

;Here comes the HPS polymorphic encryption engine, some of its features are:
;
; Size of operand modes: Byte, Word and Dword
;
; Decrypts in both directions, from lowest address to highest or starting
; at the end to the lowest address
;
; Indexing modes:
;
;       [reg]
;       [reg+imm]
;       [reg+reg]
;       [reg+reg+imm]
;
; Operations used to decrypt:
;
;       INC
;       DEC
;       NOT
;       ADD
;       SUB
;       XOR
;
; Garbage generators:
;
;       MOV reg,imm 
;       MOV reg,reg 
;       ADD reg,imm 
;       ADC reg,imm 
;       SUB reg,imm 
;       SBB reg,imm 
;       AND reg,imm 
;       NOT reg,imm 
;       XOR reg,imm 
;       OR reg,imm 
;       PUSH/Garbage/POP
;       CALL
;       JMP
;       Conditional jumps
;       MOVZX reg,reg
;       One byte instructions
;
; The engine uses a table to store the state of each register at any time
; while working
;
; The engine never generates each decryptor step in the same order, like
; this:
;
;       Load index register
;       Load counter register
;       Decrypt
;       Modify index register
;       Modify counter register
;
; This steps are generated inside subrotuines that can appear at any
; position in the decryptor code, like this:
;
;       Decrypt
;       Load counter register
;       Modify index register
;       Load index register
;       Modify counter register
;
; The garbage code generator can be called by itself in a recursive way,
; so it can generate complex sequences of nosense-looking code
;
; The resulting code is always hard to follow
;
;This kind of code is always hard to understand, i hope the comments are
;enough to guide you through this poly engine
