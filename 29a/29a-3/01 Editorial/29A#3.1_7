  We didn't have the time to code a little game or write something for the
secret area and because of that we've excluded the secret area from 29A
Magazine issue 3, we'll do our very best to make sure the secret area returns
in the future issues of 29A.

The password for the secret area in 29A Magazine issue 1 is: 29akewl
The password for the secret area in 29A Magazine issue 2 is: crclabs
