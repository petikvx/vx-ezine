About the author:

Former  DOS/Win16  virus writer, author of several virus  families,  including
Ginger  (see Coderz #1 zine for terrible buggy example, contact me for  better
sources  ;),  and Virus Bulletin 9/95 for a description of what   they  called
Rainbow.   Co-author  of  world's first virus using circular  partition  trick
(Orsam, coded with Prototype in 1993).  Designer of world's first XMS swapping
virus  (John Galt, coded by RT Fishel in 1995, only 30 bytes stub, the rest is
swapped  out).   Author of world's first virus using Thread Local Storage  for
replication  (Shrug, see Virus Bulletin 6/02 for a description, but they  call
it Chiton), world's first virus using Visual Basic 5/6 language extensions for
replication  (OU812), world's first Native executable virus (Chthon),  world's
first  virus  using process co-operation to prevent termination  (Gemini,  see
Virus  Bulletin 9/02 for a description), world's first virus using polymorphic
SMTP  headers (JunkMail, see Virus Bulletin 11/02 for a description),  world's
first viruses that can convert any data files to infectable objects (Pretext),
world's  first  32/64-bit  parasitic EPO .NET virus (Croissant),  and  world's
first virus using self-executing HTML (JunkHTMaiL, see Virus Bulletin 7/03 for
a description).  Author of various retrovirus articles (eg see Vlad #7 for the
strings  that make your code invisible to TBScan).  Went to sleep for a number
of  years.   This is my first virus for Win64.  It is the world's first  virus
for Win64 on Intel Itanium.


What is Thread Local Storage?

This is what Microsoft has to say about it:
"The  .tls  section  provides direct PE/COFF support for static  Thread  Local
Storage  (TLS).   TLS is a special storage class supported by Windows NT.   To
support  this  programming construct, the PE/COFF .tls section  specifies  the
following  information: initialization data, callback routines for  per-thread
initialization and termination, and the TLS index".

So,  Thread Local Storage (TLS) is a Microsoft invention for applications that
need  to  initialise  thread data before main execution begins.  To  do  this,
there  are callback pointers.  These functions execute before the code at  the
main  entry  point!   Clearly, this is a new way for viruses to run  and  even
though  AVers know about it, they probably don't support PE+ files because  no
viruses use it.

One point now:
We  can ignore the reference to .tls because there is a field in the PE header
that  points to this structure anywhere in the file.

The callback functions have the same parameters as a DLL entry-point function,
except that nothing is returned.  The declaration looks like this:

typedef VOID (NTAPI *PIMAGE_TLS_CALLBACK)
             (PVOID DllHandle, DWORD Reason, PVOID Reserved);

The Reason parameter can take the following values:

Setting                 Value   Description
DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH      1       New process has started
DLL_THREAD_ATTACH       2       New thread has been created
DLL_THREAD_DETACH       3       Thread is about to be terminated
DLL_PROCESS_DETACH      0       Process is about to terminate

The DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH and DLL_PROCESS_DETACH messages mean that we are called
for  the  host startup (after CreateProcess() but before process entry  point)
and  shutdown  (from  within  ExitProcess()), and  the  DLL_THREAD_ATTACH  and
DLL_THREAD_DETACH   mean  that  we  are  called  for  thread  startup   (after
CreateThread()  but  before  thread  entry point) and  shutdown  (from  within
ExitThread()).   This  happens for EXEs and also DLLs (but only DLLs that  are
not  loaded with LoadLibrary).  No need to hook ExitProcess() anymore  because
we will be called by ExitProcess() automatically.

It  is important to know that NTDLL.DLL (not KERNEL32.DLL!) calls the callback
functions.   Thus,  if  you need to call kernel32.dll APIs, you need  to  call
LdrGetDllHandle() to find kernel32.dll image base.  The good thing is that the
import table is filled already, so you can use the host imports.


What does TLS look like?

At offset 0xD0 in the PE+ header is the pointer to the TLS directory.
According to Microsoft documentation, the TLS directory has the format:

Offset  Size    Field                   Description
0x00    8       Raw Data Start VA       Starting address of the TLS template
0x04    8       Raw Data End VA         Address of last byte of TLS template
0x08    8       Address of Index        Location to receive the TLS index
0x0C    8       Address of Callbacks    Pointer to array of TLS callbacks
0x10    4       Size of Zero Fill       Size of unused data in TLS template
0x14    4       Characteristics         (reserved but not checked)

Notice  that the pointers are all virtual addresses (VA), not relative virtual
addresses  (RVA).   This means that if we add a TLS directory, we should  also
add  relocation items to the .reloc section, or simply remove all relocations.
The reason for this is that if the file is loaded to a different base address,
then  Windows  will  display  the  message  box  "The  application  failed  to
initialize correctly" and the file will not execute anymore.


What do the TLS fields mean?

The  TLS template contains data that are copied whenever a thread is  created.
These data can also be executable codes (after calling VirtualProtect(), since
IA64 enforces the executable bit).  If the template exists (it is optional and
so  the  fields can be null) then when the application  starts,  Windows  will
allocate  an  array for the TLS pointers and store this pointer  at  r13:0x58.
For  each  thread that is created, the size of the template is allocated  from
the  local  heap, the data are copied to there, the pointer is stored  in  the
array, and the array index is stored in the TLS index field.  A thread can get
its pointer by this formula:
qword at (qword at [r13:[0x58]] + (TLS index * 8))
Or some code:
add    r30 = 0x58, r13
ld8    r30 = [r30]                      //get pointer to array of TLS pointers
add    r31 = @ltoff(TLSIndex), gp
ld8    r31 = [r31]                      //get TLS index pointer
ld4    r31 = [r31]                      //get TLS index
shladd r30 = r31, 3, r30                //get pointer to TLS data pointer
ld8    r30 = [r30]                      //get pointer to TLS data
then access data at [r30 + offset]

The  Address  of  Callbacks  field contains the Virtual Address  of  an  null-
terminated  array of functions that receive the ATTACH/DETACH messages.  It is
valid  to have no entries in this array.  In that case, the field is  supposed
to point to eight zero bytes, however the actual field can also be null.


How to use TLS?

There are a few simple ways to use TLS to infect a file:
add a callback pointer to existing array (or create new array)
alter one of the host callback pointers
alter the code in one of the callbacks
create a new TLS directory
hijack the TLS template and alter some code somewhere in the file

If  you  want to use the TLS method to infect a file, firstly check if  a  TLS
directory  exists already.  If it does, then you can pick at random a callback
routine  pointer and change it to point to your code.  If there is no existing
TLS  directory,  then  add one by setting correctly the pointers in  your  own
version.   The template addresses can be set to null and the index pointer can
point to any writable dword (including the Characteristics field because it is
not  used).  The callback pointer will point to the array of callback  routine
pointers,  one of which will be the virus entry point.  When this entry  point
receives control, the file is loaded fully into memory and the import table is
fixed  up.  This means that we can do anything that we would do normally, like
go  resident  or  call  API functions and spread to  other  files.   The  main
difference  is  that  we are guaranteed to be called at least twice,  once  on
startup  and  once on shutdown, and twice more for every thread that the  host
uses.   This means that we must be careful to avoid recursion because we  will
also be called if we use threads in our virus code.

Hijacking  the TLS template is a technique that still has not been used.   The
idea is to make a copy of the TLS template and add the virus code to it.  When
the  process starts (or a thread is created), then the virus code is copied by
Windows  into the heap.  This means that the code is automatically placed into
a  writable memory space, without any call to malloc or memcopy.  The only two
things  that are required after that are to mark the region as executable, and
to  transfer  control to the code on the heap.  That is done by using the  TLS
index to get the heap pointer.

The transfer of control code would look something like this:
this code is in the file:
fib:
alloc                   loc0 = 0, 4, 4, 0
mov                     loc1 = rp
mov                     loc2 = gp
add                     out0 = 0x58, r13
ld8                     out0 = [out0]
add                     out1 = @ltoff(TLSIndex), gp
ld8                     out1 = [out1]
ld4                     out1 = [out1]
shladd                  out0 = out1, 3, out0
ld8                     out0 = [out0]
mov                     out1 = 1
mov                     out2 = PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE
add                     out0 = size of original TLS template, out0
mov                     out3 = sp
mov                     loc3 = out0
br.call.sptk.few        rp = VirtualProtect
fie:
mov                     b1 = loc3
br.cond.sptk.many       b1

this code is on the heap:
mov                     r2 = rp			//get return address
addl                    r2 = fib - fie, r2	//point to first byte of code in file
//rest of code is here.  do not forget to restore host bytes
mov                     ar.pfs = loc0		//restore important registers
mov                     rp = loc1		//restore important registers
mov                     gp = loc2		//restore important registers
mov                     b1 = loc3		//store real return address
br.cond.sptk.many       b1			//return to host


Epilogue:

Now  you  want to look at my example code and then to make your own  examples.
There   are  many  possibilities  with  this  technique  that  make  it   very
interesting.  It is easy when you know how.  Just use your imagination.

TLSDemo3 has an inserted TLS directory and code that displays message box.
This code runs before main entry point.

TLSDemo4 has a hijacked TLS template and code that displays message box.
This code jumps from main entry point to heap without malloc or memcopy.
