                               --------------

     Did you know, that there is some secret stuff inside of AVP4 files?

     Yep,  this  is  a list of some internal messages and resources, author
 names, plugin descriptions, comments, CLSID's, and other shit.

     Secret    stuff    has    fixed   header   of   0x0E   bytes   length,
 'KLsw\x00\x00KLsw\x04\x00\x00\x00',   and  right  after  these  bytes  the
 compressed  and  then  encrypted  stuff  is  placed.  The  decrypted (just
 unXOR'ed -- did you prayed to XOR today?) stuff begins with header of 0x1E
 bytes  length,  including  some CRC inside, and then some data, compressed
 with  the  same  method  as .AVC bases. Decompressed data contains header,
 then  list  of resources itself, and terminates with another CRC (probably
 CRC32, but who cares).

                            Secret stuff format:

             <----0x0E---->  <----0x1E----> <------ ? ----->
             KLsw00KLsw4000 [hhhhhhhhhhhcrc [hhhxxxxxxxcrc]]
             \fixed header/                 \--compressed--/
                             \-------stupidly XOR'ed-------/

     Internal format of the resource list is the following:

     length description
     ------ -----------
      0x13  useless header
       4    type (int, string, etc.)
       n    data (length depends on type, may be zero)
       4    type
       n    data
      ...
       4    CRC

     So, the following objects are containing this stuff:

   Plugin files        - Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\*.PPL (.rsrc/ovr)
   Configuration files - Program Files\Kaspersky Lab\*.KLR (plain)
   Some libraries      - Program Files\KAV Shared Files\*.DLL (.rsrc)
   Registry settings   - System Registry, in binary form
     (HKLM\Software\KasperskyLab\Components\101\Standalone\OptionsPagesState)

     Well,  rigth after we understood what the injustice kaspersky is going
 to  do, we spent some hours and wrote a little program, called AVP4 Secret
 Resources Unpacker (AVP4SRU), and unpacked all the found secret stuff just
 for fun. See *.SRU files for details.
