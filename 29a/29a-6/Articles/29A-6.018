
VirtualChain is a (new?) technology to get polimorphic virus based entirely
on permutation.

Code is viewed as a chain, made of links.
Each link has, at least:
- content: none | one | some instructions
- next-link-jump: a jump to the next logical link

With that structure every link can be moved elsewhere, if pointers to & in
that link are recalculated.

One can distinguish betwen:
- phisical chain: the thing currently stored in memory, maybe with trash
inside, a sequence of links one after the other, but will be not executed
in that way.
- virtual chain: the sequence of links as they will be executed, the
sequence you'll get following the jumps, the logical sequence.

Only one logical algorithm exists, but can be virtualchained in almost
infinite diferent ways.
Better than this; one virus, once virtualchained, can replicate itself in
almost infinite diferent ways. If it permutes all his links during the
replication process, it can produce a completely polimorphic copy.

As content size decreases, difficulty to recognize virus increases.
