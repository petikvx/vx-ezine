The virus is formed by 3 parts: CODE, DATA and GENOTYPE. These block are 
inserted in already existing sections, and all RVAs and structures(import,
export,resources,etc) are fixed, if relocations exists. If relocations dont
exists, all data added go to last section.

CODE is always changed via the metamorphic engine: mixed, garbling added, 
instructions changed, and then optimized. Then CODE is added to the existing
.code section(1st section).

DATA is the read-only/read-write data used by the virus. CRCs of API names,
search mask, copyrights, variables, all these shits are here. It is added
to any section that have read/write attributes, encrypted.

GENOTYPE is the data that the metamorphic engine use to rebuild the 'plain'
virus from the metamorphic copy. It is a zcode compressed list of relatives
distances, plus register/flag using info. It can be added to any existing 
section.

When virus run, it decrypt its DATA, unpack GENOTYPE and use it to rebuild
'plain' virus from CODE. Then 'plain' virus is processed by the engine, and
new GENOTYPE is extracted from new generated CODE.

'Plain' virus, extracted from CODE, is not fixed: base instructions are
changed by synonymous. So, there are 2 mutations: garbling/mixing is local,
and changes are discarted when generationg new virus, but synonymous changes
are mantained in base code. 

Thus, virus have no fixed base form, evoluting from previous changes.

Due the complexity of the source, it has been placed in Binaries folder.
