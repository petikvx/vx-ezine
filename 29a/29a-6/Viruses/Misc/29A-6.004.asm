;
;	- About the bio-model:
;
;    Yellow fever probably emerged in the New World as a result of the
;    African slave trade, which brought Aedes aegypti in water containers of
;    ships. Similarly, the rise of Dengue hemorrhagic fever in Southeast Asia
;    in the late 1940s is attributed to rapid migration to cities with open
;    water storage, which favoured proliferation of the mosquito or other
;    suitable vectors. Of current concern in the USA is the fact that Aedes
;    albopictus, an aggressive and competent dengue virus vector, was
;    brought to Houston in used Asian tires and has established itself in at
;    least 17 American states (Morse and Schluederberg 1990).
;
;    Approximately 100 of the more than 520 known arthropod-borne viruses
;    (arboviruses) cause human disease. At least 20 of these might fulfill
;    the criteria for emerging viruses, appearing in epidemic form at
;    generally unpredictable intervals (Morse and Schluederberg 1990).
;    These viruses are usually spread by the bites of arthropods, but some
;    can also be transmitted by other means, for example through milk,
;    excreta or aerosols. The arbovirus infections are maintained in nature
;    principally, or to an important extent, through biological transmission
;    between susceptible vertebrate hosts by blood-sucking insects; they
;    multiply to produce viraemia in the vertebrates, multiply in the
;    tissues of the insects and are passed on to new vertebrates by the
;    bites of insects after a period of extrinsic incubation. The names by
;    which these viruses are known are often place names such as West Nile
;    or Rift Valley, or are based on clinical characteristics like yellow
;    fever.
;
;    The populations and characters of the vertebrate hosts and their
;    threshold levels of viraemia are important. Small rodents multiply
;    rapidly and have short lives, thus providing a constant supply of
;    susceptible individuals. In contrast, monkeys and pigs multiply slowly,
;    and once they have recovered from an infection, remain immune for life.
;    African monkeys are relatively resistant to Yellow Fever, but Asian and
;    American monkeys are susceptible, probably because, unlike the African
;    monkeys, they have not been exposed continuously for centuries to the
;    infection. Also, possibly related arboviruses may offer partial
;    immunization.
;
;    Arboviruses are grouped according to antigenic characters, but after
;    inoculation of one virus into a fresh animal, not only the homologous
;    antibodies, but also heterologous antibodies reacting with other viruses
;    of the same group tend to appear. Recovery from an infection by a 
;    member of one group of arboviruses may provide some degree of resistance
;    to a subsequent infection by another member of the same group. For 
;    example, infection with West Nile virus may have modified the Ethiopian
;    epidemic of Yellow Fever in 1962. Again, the effect of prior infection
;    with Zika, Uganda S and other related viruses in the forest belt of 
;    Nigeria, leading to a high incidence of related antibodies, is 
;    suggested as the explanation of the absence of epidemic Yellow Fever in
;    man in that area. These related infections probably modify the disease
;    rather than prevent infection.
;
;    With Yellow Fever, neutralizing antibodies can be found as early as a
;    few days after the beginning of the disease and are found constantly for
;    many years in the sera. The persistence of immunity does not depend on
;    exogenous reinfection. It is probable that a mosquito infected with 
;    Yellow Fever is not harmed by it, but continues to excrete the virus 
;    throughout life. This means a continuous supply and release of virus,
;    probably from the epithelial cells of the salivary glands. The virus 
;    enters man (or other animals) and gains the liver and other epithelia,
;    provoking the early antibodies in the blood, which neutralize 
;    circulating viruses. But, as suggested by Hunter (1991), antibodies
;    which can be detected for so many years in man must stem from a 
;    continuing stimulus, and the sensitive cells and their progeny probably
;    have a prophase equivalent of the virus incorporated into their genome,
;    with occasional reversion to productive development which provides the
;    stimulus for further antibody formation. A degree of immunity of this
;    kind may possibly be provided when a related virus invades epithelial
;    cells.
;
;    Infant rhesus monkeys and human infants born of mothers immune to
;    Yellow Fever have transient protective antibodies in their sera at
;    birth which persist for several months. They are probably placentally 
;    transferred, rather than coming from the mother's milk, because 
;    antibodies may disappear from infant sera while they are still suckling.
;    Passive immunity induced by injection of homologous immune serum, has 
;    been used for protection against tick-borne encephalitis in cases of 
;    special risk and similar sera could be used against other infections, 
;    particularly after laboratory or hospital accidents.

;A debugger can attach to any existing process in the system, providing
;that it has the ID of that process. Through the DebugActiveProcess
;function, a debugger can establish the same parent/child relationship
;described earlier with active processes. In theory, then, the debugger
;should be able to present a list of active processes to the user, allowing
;them to select which one they would like to debug. Upon selection, the
;debugger could determine the ID of the selected process and begin debugging
;it by means of the DebugActiveProcess function. All that is needed then is
;a mechanism for enumerating the handles of each active process in the
;system. Unfortunately, NT provides no support for determining the ID of
;other processes in the system. While this seems to render the function
;useless, it really just limits the way it can be used. On its own, a
;debugger process cannot determine the ID of other active processes, but
;with some help from the system it can get the ID of a specific process in
;need of debugging.

;Debug event handler
;
;Two functions in Win32, WaitForDebugEvent and ContinueDebugEvent, are
;designed specifically for managing debug events as they occur in a process
;being debugged. These functions permit a debugger to wait for a debug event
;to occur, suspend execution of the process being debugged, process each 
;debug event, and resume execution of the process being debugged when
;finished. Additionally, while the process being debugged is suspended, the
;debugger is able to change the thread context information of each of its
;threads. This ability provides a mechanism through which the debugger can
;alter normal execution of one or more threads in the process being 
;debugged. It can, for example, change the instruction pointer for a thread
;to refer to an instruction at a new location. Then, when the thread resumes
;execution, it begins executing code at the new location. 
;
;When a debug event is generated, it comes to the debugger packaged in 
;a DEBUG_EVENT structure. The structure contains fields that represent an
;event code, the process ID of the process that generated the debug event,
;the thread ID of the thread executing when the debug event occurred, and
;a union of eight structures, one for each of the different events.

;Make crc lookup table
;
;Generate a table for a byte-wise 32-bit CRC calculation on the polynomial:
;x^32+x^26+x^23+x^22+x^16+x^12+x^11+x^10+x^8+x^7+x^5+x^4+x^2+x+1.
;
;Polynomials over GF(2) are represented in binary, one bit per coefficient,
;with the lowest powers in the most significant bit.  Then adding polynomials
;is just exclusive-or, and multiplying a polynomial by x is a right shift by
;one.  If we call the above polynomial p, and represent a byte as the
;polynomial q, also with the lowest power in the most significant bit (so the
;byte 0xb1 is the polynomial x^7+x^3+x+1), then the CRC is (q*x^32) mod p,
;where a mod b means the remainder after dividing a by b.
;
;This calculation is done using the shift-register method of multiplying and
;taking the remainder.  The register is initialized to zero, and for each
;incoming bit, x^32 is added mod p to the register if the bit is a one (where
;x^32 mod p is p+x^32 = x^26+...+1), and the register is multiplied mod p by
;x (which is shifting right by one and adding x^32 mod p if the bit shifted
;out is a one).  We start with the highest power (least significant bit) of
;q and repeat for all eight bits of q.
;
;The table is simply the CRC of all possible eight bit values.  This is all
;the information needed to generate CRC's on data a byte at a time for all
;combinations of CRC register values and incoming bytes.
