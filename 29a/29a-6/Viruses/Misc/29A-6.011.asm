Half virus: Linux.A.443
=======================

	There's an interesting way how to infect ELF executable files under
Linux operating system.



Introduction
------------

	You should know that every executable file consists of ELF header, of
Program header table (PH) and finally of Section header table (SH). ELF header
contains some basic information like object type (ET_EXEC), machine (EM_386)
and so on. Program header table describes program's segments (.text - code
segment, .data - data segment), for whitch will be allocated virtual memory when
the program is being executed. Section header table describes other segments not
really important for us. PH table usually follows ELF header that starts at
offset 0 in the file. SH table usually lies at the end of file.
	The most important fields of ELF header are: e_entry (entrypoint),
e_phoff (PH table's file offset), e_phentsize (size of one entry), e_phnum
(number of entries in PH table), similarly e_shoff, e_shentsize and e_shnum.
PH table contains this fields: p_type (PT_LOAD), p_offset (offset from the
beginning of the file at which the first byte of the segment resides), p_vaddr
(virtual address of the segment in memory), p_filesz (size of the segment in
the file), p_memsz (size of the segment in memory - may be bigger than p_filesz)
and p_flags (PF_R, PF_W, PF_X, read write executable). SH table contains
information about all file's sections (.bss, .init, .fini, .note and so on).



Technique
---------

	The infection technique is as follows. First we should check the ELF
header: e_ident == 'ELF' + next 0x01 means 32-bit objects, next 0x01 means LSB
data encoding (Intel CPU), next 0x01 is file version. Then e_type == ET_EXEC,
e_machine == EM_386 and so on.
	Next we have to find the last loadable segment in the PH table. So we
start searching in all PH entries for p_type == PT_LOAD. The last loadable
segment may be the data segment (if there is any) or code segment in case that
there is no data segment. We can be sure the p_vaddr field in this entry is the
greatest, because the entries in PH table are sorted. Now we have to increase
the size of the file by the virus size (which is 443 bytes) plus the difference
between p_memsz and p_filesz. That is why we have to make sure our virus code
remains safely in the file and in the memory. Then we can move SH table, which
usually follows the last loadable segment to the end of the file so as the new
infected file looks very similary to the original. Then it's recommended to zero
out the space between the end of last loadable segment and the beginning of the
SH table. Now we can calculate the new entrypoint - it'll be p_vaddr + p_memsz.
Next we have to fix the changes in our PH entry: p_memsz = p_filesz += (443 +
p_memsz - p_filesz) and p_flags = 7 (PF_R | PF_W | PF_E). In the ELF header
we have to fix the SH table offset like e_shoff += (443 + oldmemsz - oldfilesz)
and in the SH table we have to fix the file offsets for the sections which has
sh_offset > end of the last loadable segment. Last we have to save the old
entrypoint and set the new one and finally to copy our virus body.



Source code
-----------

	The source code of the DEMO half virus is in linux443.tgz archive under
name a.asm . To compile it you need Netwide Assembler and elfwrsec utility
which you'll find in elfwrsec.tgz archive.



Last words
----------

	In the end I would like to say that this is NOT a COMPLETE virus, it's
just a program which infects one file with exactly given name (default name is
'1'). There's not any payload nor any function for searching for targets, so
that's why I call this program HALF virus. Feel free to try it out on any Linux
machine, get a copy of any executable, rename it to '1', run 'a' and watch the
beauty...



Disclaimer
----------

	I wrote this simple program only for demonstrating an interesting way of
ELF file infection.

	I DON'T TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESULTS CAUSED BY RUNNING A MODIFIED
COPY OF THIS CODE.
