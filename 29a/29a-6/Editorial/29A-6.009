  29A magazine issue 6 includes an  improved version of the Win32 viewer from
29A issue 5 which is coded by GriYo/29A and it doesn't includes a screensaver
because Windows already has.

  It's recommended a resolution of, at least, 800x600.

  The viewer is able to play a MP3 located in \CONFIG\MUSIC.MP3. If you don't
like the MP3 we've included change it at your pleasure.

  There aren't available parameters or commands for the viewer being designed
to be used with a mouse.

  The viewer is able to manage URLs. You will need RICHED20.DLL for this.

  "Boss key": click in the skull in the task bar.
