  In general we're against destructive payloads and the spreading of viruses
but we do not forbid our members, or those who contribute to 29A magazine to
include  destructive payloads  in their viruses nor do we forbid our members
to spread viruses.

  That is why  you will occasionally  see a  virus from  29A in  the wild or
carrying a destructive payload, even though we  do our very best to keep the
number of incidents down to a minimum.

  Destructive payloads and the spreading of viruses is the reason why people
get  in trouble,  the reason  why people like The Black Baron  got arrested,
prosecuted sentenced and finally jailed. Publishing your sources in our zine
you can get in troubles depending on laws of your country.

  We code viruses for  the fun of it, because it's our hobby, not because we
want to harm other people or to get ourselves into trouble.

  We code viruses  to invent new  techniques, improve on existing techniques
and to learn more about the various OSes. We know there are hundred of other
ways to do this, probably better ways, yet this  is what we like. This is as
we said before, our hobby, or at least one of them.

  Our goal is to create new, unique, interesting viruses and virus utilities
and to release 29A  magazine on a regular and more frequent basis. Releasing
the magazine  frequently has been a problem for us, however,  we are getting
better but it is still something for us to work at.

  We beta-test everything included in this package as much  as we can before
we release it, but there may still be bugs which we didn't find.

  We can not and will  not be held responsible for whatever you (the reader)
decides  to do  with the contents of  the 29A magazines nor can the group be
held responsible for the actions of any individual members or contributors.
