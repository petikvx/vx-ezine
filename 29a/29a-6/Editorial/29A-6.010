Regular readerz of 29A zinez surely expectz some stoned article about my insane
thoughtz :) well, here is it.

Many ppl that watch a bit the VX scene figured out that something's wrong. The
scene and many thingz inside it ain't no more what it used to be. Some coderz
talk about "dying", "decadency", some of them talk at least about really serious
problemz. What happened? Old, elite and active coderz leave or only stop
contributing to the scene. Script kiddiez and their so called "viruses/wormz"
rule the cyberworld. Suddenly it's very problem to find new, perspective coderz.
Many VX groupz are dead or inactive. AVerz earnz money from ppl that are becoz
of their 99,99% stupidity responsible for big viral epidemiez (aka "click-on-me"
wormz). Where are those elite coderz, elite groupz? Where are those high-tech
viruses which "yesterday" ruled the world? *Decandency*.

What reasonz caused this situation?


1)	< The scene is getting old >

	When Windows95 came it divided scene to two piecez - the old (dos)
	school (dying) and new (win32) school (very perspective). It took very
	long time until all needed secretz've been discovered and showed in
	high-tech viruses (such as in the old school).
	Now, Win32/Linux rule the world - old techniquez are very well known
	and it seemz we can un-hide only minor secretz or only advance the
	known onez.
	Maybe the stagnacy in VX scene is becoz almost *EVERYTHING* has been
	discovered (and now the only thing what's left is - also becoz of
	Internet phenomena existence - coding exploitz and wormz using them).
	Maybe the scene only needz another battle field, new wide-spreaded
	operating system, new architecture, new target. Will it be .NET?

2)	< Coderz are getting old >

	In a DOS age there were many groupz and elite coderz. When old coderz
	decided to leave, there alwayz've been any other cool coder that could
	fill the blank space.
	Now it seemz the scene ain't able to motivate new coderz. Maybe Win32
	architecture is too complex to understand for beginnerz.
	Perhaps it's also a sub-part of (1) point - current architecture(z)
	ain't atractive much for new coderz, so when old elite coderz leave the
	scene, there are no beginnerz that can fill the blank space and so
	bring something new.

3)	< Groupz are getting old >

	Next sub-part of the big problem. Groupz are more sensitive to (2)
	point than the whole scene (suprisely, becoz VX group is smaller than
	the scene).
	Average-and-low-level groupz dying naturaly, that's normal thing. But
	where are those elite world-wide-infamous groupz? They are getting
	inactive becoz there are no promising/quality beginnerz and elite
	coderz can't keep the quantity and/or quality of their stuff, that's
	also natural process.
	So, groupz are getting more and more inactive and finally, they got
	disbanned. Beginnerz that can't join some elite group (becoz of low
	knowledge level) sometimez they found new group that diez very soon
	becoz of NO new good memberz and becoz they usualy aren't able to learn
	more.
	Again, the main reason is that there ain't enough new good beginnerz.

4)	< VX scene ain't so popular >

	Yeah, that's also one of many reasonz. Our step-brotha'z from hacking
	scene have much bigger publicity. And there's also the fact, that to
	become average hacker ain't so hard as to become average virus coder.
	Starting 90s the world-wide international network called Internet is
	exponencionaly spreading among computer freax. In the past the coding
	was much more available than hanging on the net all the day and probing
	serverz. Now, when almost everybody can be regularly connected to
	Internet the hacking is much more popular than learning assembler, Win32
	architecture, memory addressing, processor detailz etc etc...

5)	< HLLz rule the world >

	Yeah, the sad fact. Win32 architecture is full of so called high-level
	languagez (HLLz) and they have the maximal support of the environment.
	Low-level programing ain't so popular and easy such clicking by mouse
	and so creating high-functional program.
	Also, coderz take the assembler as their hobby, much more than their job.
	Beginnerz (and today I don't wonder, you do?) try to learn visual
	programming, becoz that will be their future job. Assembler is the least
	perspective language now. Sad fact.

6)	< Viruses ain't so popular >

	In the past, viruses were the most spreaded becoz ppl mainly shared their
	data on diskette, disks etc.. programz were small, effectively coded and
	very often copied.
	Today, one computer game fitz to two DVDz. Today you share data on
	Internet, read-only diskz etc..
	EXE-infectorz were so popular becoz the age allowed that. Today, wormz
	that can effectively spread via large networkz (remember Flash worm idea?
	15 secondz, pffff) are much more popular than well written, but	hardly
	spreadable virusez.

7)	< Virus coding/spreading is prohibited >

	Big problem. Many coderz that spreaded their viruses got arrested and
	beginnerz don't want to participate on it and dig their own grave.
	Yeah, for instance I don't spread viruses, I never did it and so I never
	had such problemz. But code virusez and not spread them, it soundz for
	beginnerz like making a breakfast and throwing it outta window. Sad fact.
	VXing is (for me) sharing ideaz, learning new thingz, reaching higher
	knowledge level, much more than damaging and making problemz. And for)
	instance, when you are hacking, you alwayz make damagez, but when you are
	coding, you don't need to.
	To such beginnerz that decide to not code viruses becoz they can't spread
	I can say this: You want to spread viruses becoz you want to become fame,
	that's what it's all about. Look at me, I've been many timez in CNN,
	newspaperz, TV, radio etc etc.. I can say I AM famous (even when it's
	not my target to be famous); and I've achieved the fame better way than
	like a terrorist.

So, that were 7 main reasonz why the scene is in the situation as it is. Now, we
should ask ourself what we can do with it. I'm sure the 2002 year ain't the right
age for the VX scene end. Well, what we are able to do?


1)	< Think about it >

	This is the 1st and the most important point. If you are beginning,
	average or elite coder, if you are in some group or not, you should know
	that the future of the scene dependz on you. Yeah, even on you! Don't
	forget to share your knowledge and spread it, as much as you can.

2)	< Publish your work in some zine >

	Don't let yourself, your flame of knowledge burn out! Becoz the scene
	ain't you, even not me... the scene is ALL active coderz and groupz.
	And if you keep your ideaz for yourself, if you don't contribute to
	scene, you've simply wasted your time while you was coding.

3)	< Join some good VX group >

	Maybe some independent coderz won't agree with me, but in good group
	(and 29A is fucking good group :-) coderz easier learn new thingz,
	share ideaz, make co-operative projectz, publish the work and teach
	otherz. That's why I'm telling you "go and join some good VX group".
	Don't be selfish and think on the scene.
	Yeah, there are some well known coderz that aren't memberz of any
	group, and they contribute fucking well. Yeah, becoz they are
	"residentz" of the scene, they know the scene a lot and understand it.
	But for beginnerz it's much better to join some group, becoz in the
	group goes everything faster (i.e. learning process, netiquette etc).

4)	< Be opened to otherz >

	Yeah, that's it. In the past, when VXing was very popular, there raised
	many VX groupz - they wanted to show otherz their vision of virus coding.
	VX groupz looked for the first sight like some kind of sect or clan.
	Now, VX groupz loox they aren't able to keep the activity, even when they
	have very smart memberz. Simply, the reason of existence of big amount
	of small groupz disappearz.
	I think VX groupz shoud co-operate much more than now, becoz they ALL
	create the scene, not one group, one member, but everyone who contributez.
	If everything will go well, 29A, iKX and Matrix groupz will publish their
	first common e-zine.

5)	< Represent the scene right way >

	Some ppl that call themself "coderz/hackerz/vxerz" represent the scene
	like a 6-year old insane child. For them it's not problem to go to some
	newsgroup and show all ppl how stupid are them - "Im l33t hax0r & I'll
	fl00d ya heh". They mainly forget that they set bad light on the scene.
	For instance, I already wrote many articlez for virus-related sitez
	where I commented this and much more thingz. When someone ask me for
	interview (e.g. newspaperz, magazinez, TV, radio etc..), I always do
	it - and there I try to explain thingz that are usualy misunderstood.
	Not becoz of my personal fame, but for the VX scene.
	I do it becoz I am angry. Really. When I contribute somewhere with
	"Benny/29A" nickname, ppl usualy call me "terrorist". I promised myself
	that I will try to do everything to correct the vision of all those ppl
	who think that. I don't want to feel shame when I say "I am virus coder"!
	Well, today when I talk publicly somewhere, I find there many ppl that
	agree that the virus-coding can be some kind of art. And big percent of
	them have such opinion becoz of all my articlez and my activitiez.
	That's very fine to know! Ppl accept us as very good programmerz, more
	than silly ppl that cause damagez.
	I believe that this is also our target - to show ppl that the
	"virus-coder" meanz "very good programmer" - it helpz the scene very much
	to look more atractively!


Huh, seemz that's all. Perhaps I forgot to mention something, but I'm already
tired (and not so stoned as on the beginning :-P). Anyway, I hope this article
motivated you a bit, becoz that was the reason why I wrote it. I hope you'll help
us to rebuild the vx scene, help the scene with problemz it has... if we don't
want to destruct what we built in past yearz. Think about it!
