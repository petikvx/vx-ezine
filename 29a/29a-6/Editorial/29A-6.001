  For this sixth issue we needed more than one year to complete it. We tried
to release it in september the same day 29A #1 was released but that was not
possible because we didn't have enough stuff to release, so the  celebration
had to be cancelled.

  For 29A #5 we just needed nine months for the release but this time we had
to do our best and even then it took us a long time to get a zine of quality
and quantity.

  What was the reason for this?

  I have been around the VX scene for many years and i don't remember in all
this time a so bad situation, and it's not easy to understand why we reached
this situation, mainly because the reasons are multiple.

  Probably  main reason  for this  situation  is the quit from  the scene of
several of  the best virus  coders: Jacky Qwerty, b0z0,  Bumblebee, etc; but
real problem is that new coders didn't replace the gap these monsters of the
virus conding left.

  Did anyone hear about researching?

  Actually there are a few coders  researching new techs, analyzing the OSs,
looking for holes, etc. Virus researching is something almost lost in the VX
scene.

  Is there life after 29A?

  I start to think that there is a curse over the people who leaves 29A.
Darkman, Lethal Mind, Mandragore, Lord Julus, Prizzy, Sopinky, Mr Sandman...
left the group and their contributions and code dissapeared from the scene.

  Where are the other groups?

  Actually  there are a  few virus groups  and some of them could be  hardly
considered groups because their production is null. So, IKX  seems to be the
only one group able to "compete" with 29A.

  So, the future is uncertain and only working all together will be able  to
put the VX scene where it used to be.

  In this section we  used to do promises for the future and set goals... As
things are actually, i don't consider good idea tell we will do this or that
because we don't know what's going to happen in the future. We will continue
working to release more zines but it also depends of YOU, reader.
