Virus Description :  The Furio virus does not infect the Normal Template at
                     all. It also does not rely on Auto run macros to spread.
                     This makes it very different to the common macro virus.
                     When an infected document is run the virus sets all of
                     the Word virus protection/Security settings to their
                     lowest. It then registers the computer username to "The
                     WalruS". It then exports its macro code to C:\Windows\Furio.drv
                     and sets this file as hidden. It then exports its UserForm
                     to "C:\Windows\AboutFrm.Frm". The virus then checks to see
                     whether its installed by seeing if the file
                     "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\STARTUP\Furio.dot"
                     exists and If not then installs itself. It does this by opening
                     the normal template as a document, infecting it with the exported
                     macros and UserForm then saves it to
                     "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\STARTUP\Furio.dot" and
                     closing it. All of the above is done on AutoClose. The
                     normal template is not infected and therefore does not
                     increase in size. Furio.dot is now installed everytime
                     word is opened due to it being in the Word StartUp folder.
                     To infect documentsThe Furio.dot hooks FileOpen, FileSave
                     and FilePrintDefault macros. They behave as normal however
                     they also infect and save the active document should the
                     marker text "' Furio" not be present on line 1 of the code.

Stealth           :  The virus contains 3 very simple stealth macros
                     ViewVBCode, ToolsMacro, FileTemplates. They contain no
                     code and just "hook" the macro so it no longer performs
                     its normal behaviour. A ToolsOptions macro is also
                     present for stealth. When the user selects this macro
                     the virus restores the Virus Protection and Save Normal
                     Prompt settings to ON, displays the Tools Options dialog
                     as usual and then resets these settings to OFF once the
                     menu has been closed.

Payloads          : If the Second Now = The Minute Now on AutoClose, the
                    Furio virus opens notepad and displays the following
                    message "Hello there! Im the WalruS. Welcome To My New
                    Creation - Furio  ///0-0\\\    WalruS 09/00". The virus
                    then sets the Word environment to white text on blue
                    screen. If Help About is selected a userform is shown.
                    If Print is selected and the second now is 59 then Furio
                    types " Please Select Help About For More Information!"
                    at the end of the document and then prints as normal.
