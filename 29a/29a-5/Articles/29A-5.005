  Introduction
  컴컴컴컴컴컴

   This tutorial explains how to  expand a compressed file  using win API
  and MS COMPRESS.EXE. It is a lame tool to compress files with a LZ algo
  and the format required by LZEXPAND.DLL. Look at tools section  at this
  zine and you'll find COMPRESS.EXE there.

   We can compress a dropper, as example, and put inside your virus body.
  Due the dropper was compressed  using an external program we don't need
  to care about the  compression algo. When we need the file uncompressed
  we don't need to  carry the expand  routines inside  virus body because
  winshit provides us a simple way to expand it using standard win32 API.

   Even LZ77 doesn't gives us wonder  compression ratios it's interesting
  check it coz  it could work  as encryption and may  be your huge 20 kbs
  infector that has  a dropper for irc will reduce it's size in some kbs.
   Test it and if you feel it's worth it: let's LZEXPAND it!


  What is a LZEXPAND.DLL?
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   It's simply a library that contains some functions  to manage the LZed
  files within our win32 appz.
   Let's check what is provided:

        LZCopy          Copies a compressed file into an uncompressed one
        LZOpenFile      Opens a compressed file and returns a handle
        LZClose         Closes a file handle by LZOpenFile
        
   There are other functions but we are going to use only those.


  Get LZEXPAND.DLL
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   We need to load  LZEXPAND.DLL library  and get the address of the func
  in order to use them. It is done as usual. Notice we  call LZ32.DLL coz
  we are running a 32 bits app and LZEXPAND.DLL is a lame NE file :)
  Let's show ya an example:

  ; ebp assumed to be delta offset
  ; some API addr required:
  ; LoadLibraryA GetProcAddress
  LzExpandZs    db      'LZ32.dll',0    ; this is the wrapper for 32bits
  LzExpandHnd   dd      0
  LzFuncZs0     db      'LZCopy',0
  LzFuncZs1     db      'LZOpenFileA',0
  LzFuncZs2     db      'LZClose',0
  LzFuncZsA     dd      offset LzFuncZs0,offset LzFuncZs1
                dd      offset LzFuncZs2
  LzFuncAddr:
  _LZCopy       dd      0
  _LZOpenFile   dd      0
  _LZClose      dd      0

        lea     eax,LzExpandZs+ebp
        push    eax
        call    dword ptr [_LoadLibraryA+ebp]
        or      eax,eax
        jz      LzExpandNotLoaded               ; failed loading dll
        mov     dword ptr [LzExpandHnd+ebp],eax

        lea     esi,LzFuncZsA+ebp               ; array func stringz
        lea     edi,LzFuncAddr+ebp              ; array to store addresses
        mov     ecx,3
  GetLzFuncLoop:
        mov     edx,dword ptr [esi]
        add     edx,ebp
        push    esi edi ecx
        push    edx                             ; api strz
        push    dword ptr [LzExpandHnd+ebp]     ; dll handle
        call    dword ptr [_GetProcAddress+ebp]
        or      eax,eax
        pop     ecx edi esi
        jz      LzExpandFuncNotFound            ; failed getting api
        mov     dword ptr [edi],eax
        add     esi,4
        add     edi,4
        loop    GetLzFuncLoop

   Do not copy and paste. Understand it!    
  And remember  to call FreeLibrary  when LZEXPAND work  is done. I think
  can be easily translated to HLL. Only asm example :) I'm sure this code
  is very basic and you already know it.


  Using LZEXPAND.DLL
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   A LZEXPAND session goes as folows:

        1. LZOpenFile source (compressed)
        2. LZOpenFile destination (where to place uncompressed)
        3. LZCopy source over destination
        4. LZClose source
        5. LZClose destination

   Let's see the funcs protos:

    int LZOpenFileA(LPTSTR filename,LPOFSTRUCT reOpenBuf, WORD style)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    filename: The zero string of the file to open.
    reOpenBuf: Pointer to a  struct that will  be filled. It's  used for
    for re-open matters...

    OFSTRUCT            struc
        cBytes          db      ?       ; lenght of the struct
        fFixedDisk      db      ?       ; non zero if file on HDD
        nErrCode        dw      ?       ; DOS error code if open fails
        Reserved        dw      ?,?
        szPathName      db      128 dup(?) ; path name
    OFSTRUCT            ends

    style: Action to take.

        OF_READ         equ     0000h
        OF_WRITE        equ     0001h
        OF_CREATE       equ     1000h
        OF_...

    The func returns a file handle or a valid handle on error.

    long LZCopy(int source, int destination)
    ----------------------------------------

    source: a file hadle from LZOpenFile with OF_READ style.
    destination: a file hadle from LZOpenFile with OF_WRITE style.

    Returns the size of the destination file and < 0 value for error.
    
    void LZClose(int handle)
    ------------------------

    handle: handle of file from LZOpenFile to close.

   Here follows an  example that  expands a file  called file.tx_  into
  a file.txt.  Notice that  delta offset is not needed  so ebp has been
  removed. I tried to use previous pieze to get  APIs from LZEXPAND.DLL
  with minium changes.

;  This is an exaple of the use of LZEXPAND.DLL
;  Notice the ebp stuff is removed due is not required!
;  Expands file.tx_ to file.txt.

   As you can see it's very easy :)


  Where to use it
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   As i said in the introduction LZ algo  that uses MS Compress and LZEXP
  is not very good. We will get better compression ratio with huge files.
  The only way to know  if we can use it in our projects  it's just doing
  some tests. Let me show you a nice example of LZEXPAND usage:

     We have a two-parts virus:
                                 a. PE infector coded in asm
                                 b. Word Macro

     If our PE infector is less  than 4 kbs there is nothing to  compress
    but if the macro part is about 100 kbs... :). The idea is to compress
    the word doc and store compressed into the PE part. When the PE pieze
    runs it drops an uncompressed  sample of the doc. The doc is a little
    installer that creates some macroz and... blah blah.
     We get:
                      Inside PE files         Macros
                   /----------------------------------------\
     With LZEXPAND |   4 + n   kbs     |  100 + (4+n)   kbs |
  Without LZEXPAND |   4 + 100 kbs     |  100 + (4+100) kbs |
                   \----------------------------------------/

    With n less than 100 kbs. I've tested with Plage2000 and i've got:

        Un-compressed:  102.400 bytes
           Compressed:   32.597 bytes

     As you can see, in this example we can use LZEXPAND very fine.


  Last words
  컴컴컴컴컴

   Micro$oft Winblows  if full of shit  we can use for our own profit. We
  only need to see what it brings and just get it. Now you can use simple
  compression in your projects with the APIs provided by M$.

   I hope you enjoy this little article. Nice coding!
