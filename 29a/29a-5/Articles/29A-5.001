  Introduction
  컴컴컴컴컴컴

   People thinks PE DLL files are the same than PE EXE files, but this is
  not 100%  right. The  format it's the same, but not the  way the  files
  works. I've noticed that coding DLL infectors ;)
   This is a  little article that  shows you some tips you must take into
  account while infecting this kind of PE files.


  What is a DLL?
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   In first place don't think  DLL are only files with the DLL extension.
  In your system there are different extensions that hides DLLs: CPL, AX,
  ACM, ...

  Let me hack this little description of DLLs from the Win32 SDK:
  
  ' In Microsoft Windows, dynamic-link  libraries  (DLL) are modules that
  contain functions and data. A  DLL is loaded  at runtime by its calling 
  modules  (.EXE  or DLL). When a DLL  is loaded, it is  mapped  into the 
  address space of the calling process.

  DLLs can define two kinds of functions: exported and internal. 
  The exported functions can be called by other modules. 
  Internal functions can only  be called from  within the  DLL where they 
  are defined. Although  DLLs can export  data, its data  is usually only 
  used by its functions.
  DLLs provide a way to modularize applications so that functionality can
  be updated  and  reused  more easilly. They  also  help  reduce  memory 
  overhead  when several  applications use  the same functionality at the 
  same time,  because although  each application gets its own copy of the 
  data, they can share the code. '

   This description gives us some points we must analize:

        . The DLL it's loaded in the address space of the calling
          process.
        . Several applications use the same funcionality at the same
          time.
        . They can share code.


  Considerations
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   The first point  we  get from the  description say us  the DLL will be
  relocated very often. We must think this will happen EVER. So we cannot
  rely in jumps to DLLEP (host entry point) to return control to infected
  program. We need to relocate this address. Nice  way to do it could be:

        lea     esi,virusBegin+ebp
        sub     esi,dword ptr [calculatedVirusBegin+ebp]
        add     dword ptr [DLLEP+ebp],esi

            virusBegin -> where the virus starts to run
  calculatedVirusBegin -> EP calculated for the virus in the infection
                          process.
                 DLLEP -> old entry point

   Let's imagine we infect a DLL with image base 70000000h and  the DLLEP
  7000d000h (Entry Point+Image Base). We put our virus  at the end of the
  last section and its RVA is 7001e000h. We patch the  header and put the
  entry point 0001e000h. At this point we save our  calculated EP and the
  old  DLLEP (7001e000h  and 7000d000h). Later when  this DLL is executed
  our virus does it's work and  need to return to the  original code. But
  we cannot rely  the DLL it's  loaded at 70000000h so  we cannot jump to
  7000d000h  (old EP). Now the previous  code rules. You get your current
  EP by the way of the  delta offset (into ebp  in the example). Then you
  sub the supposed virus EP (7001e000h) and then you get the displacement
  of the DLLEP. This is simple and could be done in several ways.

   But this first  point gives  us more things to think in. The  DLL uses
  some things from the caller environment:

        . The work directory: useful to find new files to infect.
        . The heap and the stack: this is a great problem 'cause you NEED
          to be very careful with the use of the stack. The heap is not a
          problem, but the stack could  be a nightmare. Suppose a process
          loads 5 DLL and all  are infected. If the virus uses 100h bytes
          of stack... 500h  bytes  are  used  by the process. You must be
          as light as possible with stack while infecting DLLs.

   Now let's go into second point. The fact that several applications can
  use the same  DLL requires the  DLL has a way to  manage that work. The
  DLLEP has the following spezial structure:

  BOOL WINAPI DllEntryPoint( HINSTANCE hinstDLL,
                                DWORD fdwReason,LPVOID lpvReserved)

  HINSTANCE hinstDLL -
   This is a handle to the DLL.

  DWORD fdwReason -
   This is a flag that shows the DLL why DLLEP  is called. This is a very
  important point. Indicates one of the following:

          . A process is attaching the DLL to it's address space.
          . The process is creating a new thread.
          . A thread is exiting cleanly.
          . A process is detaching the DLL.

  LPVOID lpvReserved -
   Indicates some parametres to DLL initialization and cleanup.

   As you can see  fdwReason is very important  and show us a very, very
  important point: the  DLLEP could be (and it will be) called more than
  once.
   You must take this into account. Your virus will  be called more than
  once and this could be  very fucking in encrypted  viruses. In non-enc
  viruses  there is no  problem in 1st instance. But... what  happens if
  your decrypts twice? hehehe.
   We could rid of this problem patching the virus to  return host if it
  called more than once or verifing the virus is  decrypted to not do it
  again. Make yourself.

   At last we have they can share code. No problem. There is not anythin
  you cannot check in section properties.

   But  experience  gave  me  another  points. It's  possible  a DLL has
  NO CODE! Imagine  what  happens  if you  infect  a DLL  that  only has
  resurces ;) This is easy to check: just look code base is not equal to
  zero, as example.


  Last words
  컴컴컴컴컴

   I feel  DLL infection  very useful and not very  complex  if you care
  of some points. And now with this article you can ;)
   Most programs  does all its  work by DLLs and the  main EXE file it's
  only  for the GUI. So DLL infection with  per-process residency it's a
  great choice.
   I hope you've found this article interesting.
