  1. Overview
  컴컴컴컴컴

   SMTP it's a protocol independent of the transmission subsystem and
  requires only a ordered communication channel.  This mean we cannot
  use UDP but TCP. The SMTP defines a way of 'speak' with servers and
  send, receive and manage mail and mail sessions.

   This little guide explains  how to send a mail using this protocol
  and  some  tricks  you  can  use  in  the  process.  Most  of  this
  information can be found in the internet RFC821. Moreover there are
  some tips you can get only from the experience. This is a guide and
  the  full  information  of  the  protocol is not  avaliable but the
  needed to send a mail succesfuly.


  2. Syntaxis
  컴컴컴컴컴

   Here follows a little brief of the different messages that  can be
  used by  the client  and the server. Notice that  is very important
  to put spaces only where  required 'cause so old SMTP servers could
  have lame implementations and could  be possible the server doesn't
  process the message.

     Client messages:

          [CRLF] := pair of character equal to 0dh,0ah (0a0dh)
        [string] := vector of character without special chars
          [host] := string between < > '<bumblebee.net>'
       [address] := e-mail address between < > '<29a@bumblebee.net>'
    [multi-line] := different strigs separated by [CRLF]

        HELO [host][CRLF]

        MAIL FROM:[address][CRLF]

        RCPT TO:[address][CRLF]

        DATA[CRLF]
        [multi-line]
        [CRLF].[CRLF]

        QUIT[CRLF]

    Server responses:

     Some particular:

        220<string>[CRLF] := Service ready
        250<string>[CRLF] := Requested action okay
        221<string>[CRLF] := Closing transmission
        251<string>[CRLF] := Fowarding mail
        354<string>[CRLF] := Start main input

        Some general: (use * as wild card: char from 0 to 9)

        4**<string>[CRLF] := Not error but fail. Retry.
        5**<string>[CRLF] := Error. Better disconnect!


  3. Client messages
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

        HELO [host][CRLF]

         It's used to identify  the client. This is not needed i  all
        the servers but it's a good idea  to include it. If you don't
        use it  and it's  needed the server  will ask you for it when
        you  perform  other  operation. Most of  the servers will not
        check this host. Server ever knows the address  of the client
        so include  it and don't  use a fake address.  Server answers
        message 250 if all it's ok.

        MAIL FROM:[address][CRLF]

         This begins the 'send mail' process. The address required by
        MAIL FROM can be different from client  address and host used
        by HELO. This is an interesting point 'cause you can put here
        the fake address you want, www.microsoft.com as example ;)
        Some servers only allows addressed of registered users in its
        domain,  but this is  not  very  frequent. This  command will
        return message 250 if all it's ok.
        This command must be followed by RCPT TO and DATA.
        
        RCPT TO:[address][CRLF]

         This lets know the  server the destination  recipient of the
        mail. This  address MUST  be a right address  if you want the
        mail arrives ;) If the servers supports fowarding the address
        doesn't needs  to be  owned  by  the server. This  is in most
        cases. This  command will  return message  250 from server if
        fowarding not needed and 251 if  the recipient account is not
        in the server. This command must  be after MAIL FROM and must
        followed by DATA.
        
        DATA[CRLF]
        [multi-line]
        [CRLF].[CRLF]

         This is a  non-simple  message.  Begins with  a DATA command
        that lets know  the server we  are going to  send the body of
        the mail. If all goes ok, previous right use of MAIL FROM and
        RCPT TO, the server answers 354 and waits the mail input.
        The mail input  is a multi-line  entry that must  be finished
        with [CRLF] dot [CRLF], without spaces between [CRLF] and the
        dot. If all  is ok the  sever will answer 250. In  most cases
        the mail is processed just now, but in other cases the server
        will wait until you send the QUIT message.
        
        QUIT[CRLF]

         This is  used to  close the  session  with the  server. This
        command ends with disconnection and with the 221 response.
        Notice that several servers wait until  you close the session
        to process the mail to make sure you close the session in the
        right way, not closing the connection in dirty way.


  4. Server messages
  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   Server messages could change  from one to another implemetation of
  the protocol. There are  servers that follow the  reply code with a
  space and other use a minus sign. Moreover the strings that gives u
  a little  description  of the reason of the reply  code could be in
  any lenguage  and format.  Don't rely on them. You  must  only take
  into account the three first bytes of the reply, thus the code that
  is in  ASCII  format. But  remember the SMTP  session is connection
  oriented 'cause  the  order of  the messages is important. You must
  read the whole reply message until the [CRLF].


  5. Practice
  컴컴컴컴컴

   The simplest way  to practice  this protocol and  understand it is
  using a telnet client to  connect with a SMTP  server and send your
  first mail.

   The SMTP server are listening port 25. So you can connect by:

      telnet smtp.server.dom 25

   Try with a server that has SMTP. Most web based  mail systems have
  an address different of the one you use to send mail, so this could
  not be a  good idea. But test it simply  connecting to port 25. Try
  with mail.hotmail.com (not www.hotmail.com cause this is for HTTP),
  but i'm not sure if it will work.
   We are going  to assume you  connected without problems. Let's use
  C for client and S for server. This could be your session:

         S: 220 SMTP.SERVER.DOM Simple Mail Transfer Service Ready
         C: HELO <bumblebee.net>
         S: 250 Hello bumblebee.net!

         C: MAIL FROM:<bumblebee@microsoft.com>
         S: 250 OK

         C: RCPT TO:<support@avp.com>
         S: 251 User not local; will forward to support@avp.com

         C: DATA
         S: 354 Start mail input; end with <CRLF>.<CRLF>
         C: Hi AVP people!
         C: Are you Anti Viral Perverts?
         C: .
         S: 250 OK

         C: QUIT
         S: 221 SMTP.SERVER.DOM Service closing transmission channel

   Simple, isn't it? Make different tests. Now you only  need to code
  your own engine!


  6. Experience
  컴컴컴컴컴컴

   There are some things the  official documentation  doesn't say and
  you must take into accout to avoid problems:

        . The only  one reliable part  of the reply  message  of  the
        server are  the three first  bytes in each  reply. There is a
        rule that allows  modern servers to have  milti-line replies.
        That's  using  the - sign after the code of  reply. Last line
        will not have it:

         S: 220-SMTP.SERVER.DOM Simple Mail Transfer Service Ready
         S: 220-That's an exaple of milti-line reply
         S: 220 Ready to rock!

        . In big networks could be that the SMTP server to send mails
        is not the same that for incoming messages.
        . The web  based mail  could give  problems like the previous
        point. You can try to  send a mail to bee@easymail.com by the
        connection to  easymail.com. This is  the simplest way 'cause
        with one address you have the  server to send and the address
        for the  destination. The problem could  be there is not a 25
        port avaliable listening for connections.
        . The server will fill some fields in the mail for you. These
        are usualy the fowarding  address (if avaliable), the host of
        the  client (not necessary  equal  to sender address), and in
        some cases the date if is not filled by the sender.
        . You need to implement a standard format for the mail if you
        want to send a  file (hehehe). May be  MIME 1.0 it's the best
        solution. Keep in mind the previous point filling this data.
        . Don't  assume  you  are  coding  something 100% compatible,
        there is a  implementation  in a server  waiting to fuck your
        client ;)


 That's all. I hope you've found this article interesting and useful.
