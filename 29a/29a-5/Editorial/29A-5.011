     "No  one  would  have  believed, in the last years of the nineteenth
     century,  that  human  affairs  were being watched from the timeless
     worlds   of   space.  No  one  could  have  dreamed  we  were  being
     scrutinized,  as  someone  with  a microscope studies creatures that
     swarm  and  multiply in a drop of water. Few men even considered the
     possibility  of  life  on  other planets and yet, across the gulf of
     space,  minds  immeasurably  superior  to  ours  regarded this Earth
     with  envious  eyes,  and  slowly  and surely, they drew their plans
     against us."


        A letter of introduction... A few words spread on the paper, a number
 of  paragraphs  meant  to  impress you, to raise a feeling inside of you, to
 make  you  read  this magazine futhermore and give it's local color. That is
 what  this  SHOULD be, but it is not... It is merely a statement of a person
 who  is  not any more whom once he proudly used to be. An assertion meant to
 bore you to death probably, but, you know... I cannot help it... this is me.
 Please read carefully the "War of the Worlds" passages as they will give you
 the explanation of many concepts like "weakness", "faith", "unknown"... They
 are  not  here  just to fill in the pages. They are here because I feel like
 exactly  the  humans  in  this story... Who are the Martians, then, you will
 ask? Thou shall see in a minute...


     "At  midnight  on the twelfth of August, a huge mass of luminous gas
     erupted  from  Mars  and  sped  towards  Earth.  Across  two hundred
     million miles of void, invisibly hurtling towards us, came the first
     of  the  missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth. As I
     watched,  there  was  another  jet  of  gas. It was another missile,
     starting on its way."


        I  would  like  to  ask all of you: do you feel in charge of your own
 life?  Do  you  feel  that you are the Master of your own self? Do you think
 that  your  life  is something that you control and never shall it escape of
 your  grip? Do you feel this? Then, you are either no more than 18 years old
 or you are the President of the United States (even here there could be some
 problems).  Let  me tell you, guys, which are the few priorities people have
 in  their  life,  and  I  will explain in a second how all this crap I write
 links to viruses and 29A. So, the priorities are as follow:

               1. family
               2. job
               3. hobbies

        This  is  as  shortly as one could put it. Family always comes first:
 this  is because you are borne with your family, then you choose your family
 when  you get married and furthermore you make your own family when you have
 kids.  So  for something that is as much random as non-random, it must be on
 the first place. Job, of course comes second, because job means money, means
 social  protection,  means  development. And by means of job you are able to
 support  your first priority family and your third priority, the hobbies. On
 the last place come your own hobbies. It is more than obvious why: job takes
 most  of  you  time, family gets the rest of the free time and only a small,
 small  part  of  what  is still free is left for your own hobbies... Did you
 notice  that?  Did  you notice that even IF you consider that the family and
 the  job  are  the  most  important  things  for  you,  you feel the biggest
 frustration  whenever  you  are not able to fulfill the least important one:
 the hobbies... But this is very logical! People are individuals! Individuals
 have  personality!  Personality leads to an unconscious desire of fulfilling
 your OWN dreams, your OWN pleasures, your OWN hobbies...


     "And  that's  how  it was for the next ten nights. A flare, spurting
     out  from  Mars  -  bright green, drawing a green mist behind it - a
     beautiful,  but  somehow  disturbing  sight. Ogilvy, the astronomer,
     assured  me we were in no danger. He was convinced there could be no
     living thing on that remote, forbidding planet."


        So,  this  is  probably  why I feel compelled of sending everybody my
 deepest  apologies  for not being able to fulfill all my promises. The thing
 is  that  usually I like and I do keep my promises, and also usually I don't
 really  give  a crap if somebody has anything to comment on my behalf... But
 the  actual  apologies  do not come for you, they come for myself. I have to
 apologize  to  myself for not being able to fulfill all my dreams and all my
 desires... But I have to be honest with me: life won! Life took me over... I
 have lost the battle...


     "It  seems  totally  incredible  to  me now that everyone spent that
     evening  as  though  it  were  just like any other. From the railway
     station  came  the  sound  of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling,
     softened  almost  into melody by the distance. It all seemed so safe
     and tranquil."


        You  have  no  idea  what  it  means to be a dreamer... I am a mother
 fucking  dreamer,  and sorry for cursing but it's true! I dream all kinds of
 things...  I  dream  with my eyes wide opened and that is when you feel more
 disappointed  then  ever:  when  you dream and your dreams do not come true,
 and not because of you, but because of the environment. I had so many dreams
 in  programming  for  this  year... And believe me, there is NOTHING in this
 world  that I like more than programming... And yet, believe me or not I had
 no  fucking  time  to do it!! The battle with time is not fair at all... And
 when  you  realize that you have lost, it is much, much too late... I had so
 many  ideas  during  all this time, but... job was keeping me away from home
 and  from  my computer... My girlfriend was feeling ignored... My mother and
 my  girlfriend  don't  get  along at all... I am always in the middle... And
 life becomes a mess... And out of all this shit the bottom line is: you have
 NO time left to do what you like the most...

        Isn't  it  interesting  how EVERYBODY around you thinks that whatever
 THEY  like  is  better,  whatever THEY think is more important, whenever and
 whatever  THEY want to do has the biggest priority? Isn't it interesting how
 EVERYBODY  knows  better  than you what is the best for YOU?!?! And what can
 you  do?  You  have  to  comply  because,  remember?  The family is the most
 important... Isn't it funny how nobody around you simply does not understand
 that  programming  for the programmer is as important as is painting for the
 painter? How can everybody be so bounded and blinded that they simply do not
 understand this??

        You  will  not  believe me, but it's the truth: as I was writing this
 article  my  mother bursted into the room kicking and screaming that I don't
 let  her  read  some email message from my sister and I am just "playing" on
 the  computer...  See  what  I  mean?  THEY  are always more important... It
 doesn't  even matter that it's my computer! It doesn't even matter that it's
 my e-mail address... All that matter is for "THEM" to achieve their goals...
 Life is a shit!

     "Next  morning,  a  crowd  gathered on the Common, hypnotized by the
     unscrewing  of  the  cylinder.  Two  feet of shining screw projected
     when, suddenly, the lid fell off!"


        As  you probably understood so far, I am pretty angry. I am not angry
 on somebody in particular... nope... just on life. And what is scaring me is
 that the more I look, the more I realize that, people... this is IT! This is
 how  LIFE  is!!!  You cannot do anything about it!! We are all bound to work
 for  the  rest  of our miserable life to fulfill other's desires and dreams.
 And  guess  what:  those,  themselves  feel the same way!!!! They feel their
 dreams  are  not  fulfilled... They feel betrayed too! And that is why human
 kind is bound to be forever and ever unhappy!!!!


     "A  few  young men crept closer to the pit. A tall funnel rose, then
     an  invisible  ray  of  heat  leapt  from man to man and there was a
     bright  glare,  as each was instantly turned to fire. Every tree and
     bush  became  a  mass  of  flames  at  the  touch  of  this  savage,
     unearthly  Heat  Ray. When the smoke cleared, the little steamer had
     reached  the  misty  horizon,  and  Carrie was safe. But the Thunder
     Child  had  vanished  forever,  taking  with  her man's last hope of
     victory. The leaden sky was lit by green flashes, cylinder following
     cylinder,  and  no  one  and nothing was left now to fight them. The
     Earth belonged to the Martians."


        What  is  the most annoying is that you will always feel incapable of
 doing  anything  about  it... I think that children should be told when they
 are  borne:  hey,  kido!  It's not long until you will not be able to desire
 anything,  so  ask  for  everything  now when you still can! But, of course,
 where  would  be  the fun of discovering life? Some say that idiots learn by
 themselves  and smart people learn from the others. Well, personally I think
 that it's a combination of the two... Somewhere in the middle...


     "That  evening, there was a violent crash and I realized with horror
     that  my  home  was  now  within range of the Martian's Heat Ray. At
     dawn,  a falling star with a trail of green mist landed with a flash
     like summer lightning. This was the second cylinder.[...]
     Never  before  in  the history of the world had such a mass of human
     beings  moved and suffered together. This was no disciplined march -
     it  was  a  stampede - without order and without a goal, six million
     people  unarmed  and  unprovisioned,  driving  headlong.  It was the
     beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind."


        So,  after  this  surely boring dissertation let me tell you why do I
 feel  this  way... Briefly this is what I wanted to release in the new issue
 of  29A:  a  metamorphic engine, a polymorphic engine, a compression engine,
 three viruses and at least 4 articles. I have started all of them as follow:

     1. Engines
        a. Metamorphozis
        b. Modularis
        c. Lord Julus's Lev-Zimpel Compression Engine
     4. Viruses
        a. Win32.Rammstein
        b. Win32.Guyana
        c. Win32.SSS (SunSet Superman)
     5. Articles
        a. Compression part II
        b. Metamorphism
        c. Backdoors
        d. Local network infection
        e. Using errors under win32
     6. Utilities
        a. BeholdPE

        As  far  as  the  viruses  are  concerned  I  was only able to finish
 Rammstein  and I have to say I am really proud of this baby. Of course it is
 not  finished  as I have to include the compression engine, the metamorphism
 engine  and the poly. All my articles are currently under construction as of
 20th  of  October.  I  do hope to finish them in time for 29A. Modularis and
 LJLZ32  are also almost finished, but again... have no idea if the time will
 allow me to do it to after all... Also, I spent a lot of time working on the
 BeholdPE  utility  which finally came out to be quite an interesting program
 and  really useful. Of course, I have to work some more on it, maybe turn it
 to  Win32,  but for the moment it is pretty good... About the rest,... well,
 if you see it in this issue, it means I have succeded... but I doubt it!

        I  am  quite sure that my friends in the 29A Group, all of them great
 guys,  felt  that  I  kinda  drifted away from the group as my messages came
 always  late, they were less, my contributions don't come in time... Anyway,
 I  have  to  thank  all  of  them  for being so patient and I hope that this
 article explains most of these things...


     "A  fifth Machine appeared on the far bank. It raised itself to full
     height,  flourished  the  funnel  high in the air - and the ghostly,
     terrible  Heat  Ray struck the town. As it struck, all five Fighting
     Machines  exulted,  emitting  deafening  howls  which  roare  d like
     thunder.  [...]  With  a  white flash, the Heat Ray swept across the
     river.  Scalded,  half-  blinded  and  agonized, I staggered through
     leaping, hissing water towards the shore. I fell helplessly, in full
     sight of the Martians, expecting nothing but death."


        What  can one expect to fulfill his desires than a miracle? No, don't
 laugh!  It's  a  reality...  Nowadays,  you  need  a miracle to allow you to
 fulfill your dreams... Ok, you might think: look at this pathetic guy... his
 dreams  are  a poly engine and some articles... Yes! So WHAT?!? Who the fuck
 cares  what  my  dreams are?!? My dreams are MY DREAMS and I want to fulfill
 them... If I wanted to raise ants I would raise ants... If I wanted to build
 a  pyramid  I  would  dedicate  my  whole life to that desire!!! It's  human
 nature, people! We want to do what we like to do! It is how we are built!


     "I  looked  up and saw a third machine. It was erect and motionless,
     like the others. An insane resolve possessed me I would give my life
     to  the  Martians,  here  and  now. I marched recklessly towards the
     Titan  and  saw  that  a  multitude of black birds was circ ling and
     clustering about the hood. I began running along the road. I felt no
     fear,  only  a  wild,  trembling  exultation,  as  I ran up the hill
     towards, the motionless monster. Out of the hood hung red shreds, at
     which  the  hungry  birds now pecked and tore. I scrambled up to the
     crest  of  Primrose  Hill,  and  the  Martian's camp was below me. A
     mighty  space  it  was,  and scattered about it, in their overturned
     machines, were the Martians - dead... slain, after all man's devices
     had failed, by the humblest things upon the Earth, Bacteria. Minute,
     invisible, bacteria!"


        I  hope  you  did  not  get  TOO bored of this long and full of tears
 article...  But  this  is  the mood I am into and this is what I transmit to
 you...  I hope also that you had the time to read the passages from the "War
 of  the Worlds". It shows you how a so pride  kind like the humankind can be
 defeated  in  a few seconds if it is not careful enough... It also shows how
 it  can  find escape by something that people always considered and enemy...
 It  proves that no matter how much you think things, no matter how long  you
 make  your  plans,  there  will  always  be something that will tear-up your
 plans...  And  still,  there  will  always be hope that somewhere, sometime,
 whenever you expect less something will arise and help you out... Maybe even
 something that you considered harmful...

        See,  usually I am a very positive and happy person, so probably this
 is why I tried to end this introduction with a more or less positive note...
 The message is that regardless how BAD things are there is always HOPE...

        So,  here  I am, hoping that someday I will be able to fulfill all of
 my dreams!

        These were the words from Lord Julus... Stay well, everybody!!!
