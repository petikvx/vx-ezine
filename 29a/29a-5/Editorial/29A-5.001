  Ancient guys in the VX scene could not believe it when they heard 29A group
was  releasing his 5th  issue in december, just 9 months  after 4th issue. We
could say we scored a goal to the goal of release 29A magazine within a year,
as we promised in this same section in last issue.

  We also  promised we would  stop releasing  29A magazine  at certain dates,
and you, reader, could think 31th december is one of those certain dates, but
you  would be wrong  because back in  july we decided to release 5th issue in
december, and we, doing a nice work  of group, have been successful finishing
the issue at the expected time, also being satisfied with our work.

  In this new release we  make a new promise: 29A  will try to  don't release
more huge issues as 4th one, or at  least not due to  MP3 files. Anyway, it's
29A group who decides what's released, being decission  of each reader decide
if the zine deserves the download or not.

  From here, we would like to thank very much all the contributors to 29A #5,
those ones  who got their work published, and  those ones that  sent us stuff
to  publish  but we didn't. It's  with the  efforts of  29A members  but also
contributors how 29A gets releases of quality, that's why we, in 29A, must be
grateful to them. We are also grateful to VaW for his intro for the zine.

  Darkman, Lethal Mind, Reptile and Sopinky left 29A due  their inactivity in
the group,  Bumblebee and  Prizzy left  for personal  problems and Mandragore
joined 29A. Regards and best whises to the ex-members.

  Apologizes   to our  readers because  in last  issue we  published a  virus
(Nemesi  by AcidWerks),  already   published in  DIE #1 (SaBoTaGiO by  Techno
Knight). Thanks to T-2000 for let us notice it.

  You must notice: 29A issue 5 has to be extracted using Long FileName (LFN).

  29Aers hope readers enjoy with this new production from 29A group, and also
that antivirus companies enjoy detecting and removing viruses released in our
zine, wishing more luck to ex-AVP than  last time disinfecting GriYo's CTX or
detecting Bumblebee's 99 ways to die.
