
              Behold PE V4.0 (C) 2000 Lord Julus / 29A

        Welcome  to  a  new  utility  from  me!  This  time it's a
 Portable  Executable  viewer.  This  viewer will allow you to get
 into  the  deepest  and  darkest  places into the PE file headers
 helping you develop applications to use this information.

        This  utility  is  quite  easy  to use; basically you must
 start  with  a  PE  file  on  the  command line and then the most
 information  on  the  file  will be displayed on the main window.
 Here  you can scroll up and down to see more and you can save the
 data from the screen into a text file.

        You can also access the directories table and the sections
 and  look them up. Those sections and directories which are known
 (like  imports, exports, relocations, resources) are displayed at
 the full extend, allowing you to see everything.

        To  use  the  features  you  must  press the right keys as
 written in the status bar help.

        Good luck!

        Feel  free  to write me at lordjulus@geocities.com for bug
 reports and suggestions!

        Lord Julus / 29A
