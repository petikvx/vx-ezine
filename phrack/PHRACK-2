                    Prevention of the Billing Office Blues
                           Editorial: Forest Ranger


       In an earlier article there were ways explained on bullshiting the
Billing Office at Bell. By doing so one could disconnect a persons line,
add call forwarding, call waiting, threeway calling, speed calling, or other
options that might be available through Bell. Well, this can be very disturbing
and cause many problems so lets see how this can be prevented. First off, it
would be a very good idea to call the Billing office for your exchange and ask
that all inquires made on the your line be verified with you. Is what happens
now is that Bell marks down in your file that if you decide that you would like
a certain Bell option added to your line; they will call and check it out with
you or the person that pays the phone bill. So if someone tries to add
something onto your line you will be notified before hand. This has two
advantages, one you will prevent any occurences on your line, two you will know
that someone is attempting to mess around with your phone line. But, in the end
you will come out on top because you took the time to listen. And as Smokey the
Bear says, "Don't Shit in the woods I LIVE HERE!".

          PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS
          ------------------

              Commonly known as "zip" guns, guns made from pipe have
          been used for years by juvenile punks.  Today's Militants
          make them just for the hell of it or to shoot once in an
          assassination or riot and throw away if there is any danger
          of apprehension.

              They can be used many times but with some, a length of
          dowel is needed to force out the spent shell.

              There are many variations but the illustration shows the
          basic design.

              First, a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for
          the barrel to rest in.  The barrel is then taped securely to
          the stock with a good, strong tape.

              The trigger is made from galvanized tin.  A slot is
          punched in the trigger flap to hold a roofing, which is
          wired or soldered onto the flap. The trigger is bent and
          nailed to the stock on both sides.

              The pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas
          or water pipe with a bore that fits in a cartridge, yet
          keeps the cartridge rim from passing through the pipe.

              The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap, with a
          hole bored through it, is screwed on.  Then the trigger is
          slowly released to let the nail pass through the hole and
          rest on the primer.

              To fire, the trigger is pulled back with the left hand
          and held back with the thumb of the right hand.  The gun is
          then aimed and the thumb releases the trigger and the thing
          actually fires.

              Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in
          any hardware store.  All caliber bullets, from the .22 to
          the .45 are used in such guns.

              Some zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested
          within each other.  For instance, a .22 shell will fit
          snugly into a length of a car's copper gas line.
          Unfortunatey, the copper is too weak to withstand the
          pressure of the firing.  So the length of gas line is spread
          with glue and pushed into a wider length of pipe.  This is
          spread with glue and pushed into a length of steel pipe with
          threads and a cap.

              Using this method, you can accomodate any cartridge,
          even a rifle shell.  The first size of pipe for a rifle
          shell accomodates the bullet.  The second accomodates its
          wider powder chamber.

              A 12-gauge shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel
          pipe.  If you want to comply with the gun laws, the barrel
          should be at least eighteen inches long.

              Its firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol.
          It naturally has a longer stock and its handle is lengthened
          into a rifle butt.  Also, a small nail is driven half way
          into each side of the stock about four inches in the front of
          the trigger.  The rubber band is put over one nail and
          brought around the trigger and snagged over the other nail.

              In case you actually make a zip gun, you should test it
          before firing it by hand.  This is done by first tying the
          gun to a tree or post, pointed to where it will do no
          damage.  Then a string is tied to the trigger and you go off
          several yards.  The string is then pulled back and let go.
          If the barrel does not blow up, the gun is safe to fire by
          hand.

              You should not attempt to register such a gun.

Blow darts are easy to make and all the materials can be found in your own
home. These darts can travel a long distance with good penetration if
constructed correctly.

Materials needed:

A small piece of wood
A sewing machine needle
A spool of thread
A couple nails
Hammer
Glue
Scissors

   Hammer the two nails about two inches apart on the board. Wrap the thread
tightly around the two nails. The number of times the thread is wrapped around
the nails will determine the amount of weight and stability the dart has. Once
you have decided you have wrapped enough thread, cut it close to the nail at
around a half inch. Take this small tuft of thread and put a dab of glue on the
folded end. The kind of glue you use is very important. I suggest that you use
a tacky kind of glue (nothing runny, like Elmer's glue). Attach this to the
needle and hold until it is dry.
   Another kind of dart can be made with Q-tips. This kind of dart doesn't work
as well as the first one, but it is sometimes easier to make. first you have to
get the kind of Q-tips that have a plastic stem. Cut the Q-tip close to one
end. Insert the sewing needle into the Q-tip and secure it by melting the
plastic slightly with a lighter. This kind of dart doesn't last long because
the cotton come off easily.

Blow Guns:

   Ordinary straws make an excellent blow gun with this kind of dart. Another
kind can be made with a cheap pen by taking apart the pen and using the shell.
Any long, cylindrical, object with the diameter of a straw will work very well.

                Toward Universal Information Services Via ISDN
                ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~
                                 by Taran King

                From PROTO newsletter of AT&T Bell Laboratories
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Phase one, the Present.
         ~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~
         The local network of today, although still largely
         voice-oriented, is already on the path to Universal
         Information Services.  Lightguide fiber is dramatically
         expanding the capacity of local networks, helping to lower
         the costs and increase the demand for high-band width,
         Information Age services.  And public networks are
         increasingly digital and geared for data and special
         services.  For example:

         o The AT&T Network Systems 5ESS (TM <riiiight>) switch,
         designed by Bell Laboratories, can serve as the hub of a
         local deployment of remote modules at locations up to 100
         miles from a host central office.

         o The Integrated Special Services Network (ISSN) is a channel
         network that provides special services, customer control
         options and digital private lines rearrangeable under
         software control.  The ISSN incorporates digital carrier
         terminating equipment such as the D4 Channel Bank, D5 Digital
         Terminal System and Digital Access and Cross-connect System
         (DACS).

         o The New Centrex is bringing greater levels of customer
         control, improved services and a broad range of data
         capabilities to the business customer.

                 Today's public networks consist of multiple or
         overlay networks.  The public switched network, or circuit
         network, mainly for voice, is the base network.  Two kinds of
         overlay networks provide special services.  Channel networks
         carry private lines leased by large customers and transmit
         much of today's data and image traffic; they also handle
         traffic for network operations support.  Packet networks
         carry data communications, while packet switching is used
         internally to public networks for common channel signaling to
         set up, route and take down calls, or to give customers
         information.
                 "Overlay networks help telecommunications companies
         efficiently meet growing demand for digital transmission and
         special services," says Stan Johnston, Market Planning
         Manager, Network Systems Evolution, in AT&T Network Systems.
         "Their integration into a single network, however, would be
         still more effective."

         Phase two, the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN).
         ~~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~
         The ISDN is a concept to which AT&T is committed - and it's
         the foundation for Universal Information Services.  The
         central idea of ISDN, as AT&T Network Systems sees it, is to
         provide an individual user a link to the local central office
         of generous band-width - a digital subscriber line that can
         carry 144,000 bits per second (sure beats 2400 baud!).  The
         band-width is subdivided into two 64,000-bit channels, which
         may carry voice or data or both, and one 16,000-bit channel
         for packetized signaling information or data transport.  Such
         a link provides convenient "integrated" network access by
         accommodating voice, data and signaling over a single line.
                 The ISDN will make it easier for a customer to get
         varied services from public and private networks.  More
         bandwidth for big customers will be available through another
         ISDN access standard, the extended digital subscriber line,
         which provides 1.5 billion bits per second as 24 channels of
         64,000 bits each.
                 In 1986, new software from Bell Labs will enable the
         5ESS switch to accommodate ISDN-sized 144,000-bit channels
         that standardize and simplify subscribers' use of local
         networks.  AT&T is committed to future products that will
         also be ISDN-compatible.  Other vendors, too, some of whom
         already plan to build premises, terminal, and other
         equipment to ISDN standards, will make ISDN a cooperative
         effort.
                 By providing integrated digital access to networks,
         ISDN will make important progress toward the goal of
         Universal Information Services.  But overlay networks will
         continue to divvy up the transport job.  And messages needing
         less than 144,000 bits per second will not fill their
         allotted bandwidth, leaving capacity underutilized.

         Phase three, Universal Information Services.
         ~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~
         Rooted in the fertile ground of 5ESS switches, ISDN equipment
         and technologies such as wideband packet transport, Universal
         Information Services will bear fruit during the 1990s.  From
         a single kind of network will hang services as different as
         apples, oranges and pears.  Just as network access was
         integrated in ISDN, transport functions will increasingly be
         integrated by powerful new network equipment evolved from
         equipment developed for the ISDN.  Where customers once got
         standard-sized ISDN channels, they'll get big bandwidth for
         large jobs, little bandwitdh for small jobs.

MCI INTERNATIONAL
-----------------
MCI International provides private-line voice service to several overseas
countries, and data and message services, including telex, cablegram, leased
channel, and packet switching communications, to more than 200 overseas points.
MCI has moved into two new areas of service:  International direct-dial
telephone service and international electronic mail and hard-copy delivery
services.

International Record Services
-----------------------------
TELEX SERVICE (domestic and international) permits instantaneous, two-way,
written communications with other subscribers worldwide.  Customers can send
messages at any time, even though the receiving terminal may be unattended.
MCI International offers access to its telex service from a variety of
terminals and networks; not only subscribers with telex terminals but also
those with communicating word processors, data terminals or computers that
communicate over telephone lines can take advantage of MCI International telex
service.  To subscribers connected to its own telex network, MCI International
offers World Message Services--a package of communications offerings including
telex, cablegram and MCI Mail services.  Various service enhancements are
available to save time, improve operating efficiency and simplify records
keeping for telex users.

CABLEGRAM SERVICE, the traditional means of international written
communications, offers flexibility in delivery and economical rates for shorter
messages.  Cablegrams can be delivered to virtually any overseas point.
Subscribers with telex terminals or various other types of equipment can access
and TELUS cablegram switch and take advantage of such service enhancements as
abbreviated addressing and departmental billing.

LEASED CHANNEL SERVICE provides an exclusive line between a U.S. firm and it's
overseas office for private communications 24 hours a day.  Each MCI
International leased channel is tailored to meet the needs of a specific
customer for teleprinter, facsimile, voice and/or data traffic.  For
subscribers with several offices requiring private communications with each
other, MCI International offers a versatile message-switching service.
Voice/data leases can be configured to meet a whole array of communicating
needs; for example, one channel might carry data traffic from a computer at
night, voice communications during office hours, and simultaneous teleprinter
messages at any time.  Data channels can handle requirements for traffic at any
speed from 1200 bits per second to 1.544 megabits per second.

IMPACS SERVICE uses packet-switching technology to provide international
communications service between data terminals and computers.  Impacs offers
on-line, real-time connections and enables many types of incompatible systems
to communicate.  Impacs service offers virtually error-free transmission
because of the error-detection and retransmission capability of the network.

INSTALINK SERVICE allows businesses overseas to use regular telex equipment to
access remote computing systems and databases in the U.S.  Subscribers can
retrieve data from a computer-based information service or use a computing
system connecting to a packet-switching network in the U.S.

INTERNATIONAL FACSIMILE SERVICE enables subscribers to send duplicates of
original documents overseas quickly and efficiently, even when neither the
sender nor the receiver has facsimile transmission equipment, or when the
sender and receiver have incompatible equipment.

DATEL SERVICE provides automatic or voice-coordinated data transmission at
speeds up to 2400 bits per second.  Either digital or analog facsimile traffic
can be transmitted via Datel.  Datel facilities are conditioned to ensure
high-quality transmission.  The MCI International switching center allows
communications between incompatible terminals.

MARITIME SERVICES provide instant, high--quality contact between ships at sea
or offshore rigs, and between these vessels and land-based subscribers
worldwide.

International Voice Services
----------------------------
PRIVATE LINE SERVICE provides, fast, easy access to a single overseas location
at an economical monthly rate.  This technically efficient system maximizes the
use of line capacity by recognizing idle time and assigning a speaker to a
transmission path only when the path is needed.  Users can dial a four-digit
extension from a regular business phone to reach a key overseas location.

International Mail Services
---------------------------
WORLD MESSAGE SERVICE subscribers can access the domestic electronic mail and
hard-copy delivery offerings of MCI Mail.  In addition, MCI International is
developing fast, low-cost services that will deliver electronic messages and
high-quality printed documents worldwide.

Customer Service
----------------
THE CUSTOMER TROUBLE REPORTING ASSISTANCE CENTER at MCI International addresses
customer concerns such as equipment maintenance and service performance
questions.  Customer service specialists, on duty 24 hours a day on business
days, answer questions and electronically route service requests to technicians
nationwide.

MCI DIGITAL INFORMATION SERVICES CORP.
--------------------------------------
MCI Digital Information Services, MCI's newest unit, provides high-speed,
low-cost, time-sensitive message delivery (MCI Mail), either electronically or
via hard copy.

MCI Mail provides time-sensitive document delivery to anyone, anywhere vial
MCI's long-distance telephone network.  MCI Mail can reach a recipient
instantly, in four hours or less, or overnight by noon the next day.  Prices
are as much as 90 percent lower than comparable time-sensitive mail delivery
services.  MCI Mail can be delivered electronically, terminal to terminal, or
laser printed on letterhead stationery with the customer's signature.

MCI Mail customers can even order gifts and services direct through MCI Mail,
ranging from software and paper for personal computers to investment advisory
services to travel specials.

There are no sign-up, monthly service charges or "connect time" charges for MCI
Mail.  MCI Mail can be used by virtually any personal computer, word processor,
electronic typewriter, data terminal, telex, or other digital communications
device.  The service is accessed by a local telephone call or 800 number.

MCI Mail
--------
INSTANT delivery to an "electronic" mailbox.

FOUR-HOUR paper delivery by courier to 17 major metropolitan areas regardless
of point of origin.

OVERNIGHT paper delivery by courier by noon the next day in 20,000 continental
U.S. cities.

MCI LETTER transmitted electronically to the MCI digital postal center nearest
its destination, then delivered locally by the U.S. Postal Service.

TELEX DISPATCH enables MCI Mail subscribers to transmit messages to the more
than 1.6 million telex subscribers worldwide.

VOLUME MAIL enables customers to send large mailings in a variety of letter
formats, at substantial savings in delivery time and expense.

                       Data Line.  TWX 650-240-6356


            Rsts is one of the most versatile operating systems available for
the PDP-11 series of computers.  It can emulate both RSX and RT-11 (though not
fully), and is often a choice where multiple concurrent operating systems must
be online.  I was a system manager on an 11-23 for about a year and learned a
fair amount about the OS (perhaps forgetting a good deal in the interim).  This
phile applies to release 8.0 and the entire 7 series.  By the way, version 9.0
is it - DEC is discontinuing RSTS with that release and using 9.0 as a bridge
to VMS for the PDP-11 series.  The logon will tell which version you are
hacking.

        If the SYSTAT-before-logon has been disabled (It probably has), no big
worry.  Account 1,2 must be present on the system and contains most of the
system utilities.  On booting, the account is called at least 8 times to put
batch processors and spoolers online.  Changing [1,2]'s passwords in the
command file is a tedious process - most system managers are too lazy, so it
won't change often.  Oh yes, the default PW for 1,2 is SYSLIB.  This knowledge
should cut hacking time considerably for many systems. When you get in, RUN
$MONEY.  This gives all accounts, KCT's (Billing units), accesses, time on
system, and PASSWORDS, if you ask.  Don't reset the system when it asks, it
merely zeroes the program and not the hardware, but could tip someone off that
he system had been hacked.

           Personally, I like running out of a new account, so RUN $REACT.
Pick a new account , making sure the first number (before the comma) is a "1"
to get full privilege.  Accept defaults for disk placement.  As for Cluster
size, I prefer 4.  It's large enough to get fast disk access, but small enough
so that little space is wasted for small files.  Cluster size is shown (CLU or
CLS) on MONEY and on DIR/FULL.  Follow conventions and you'll stand less chance
of being noticed.

        RSTS has some of the most complete HELP files short of a CDC mainframe.
HELP HELP will give the forst screen of the nested menus.  Be sure to do this
from a privileged account or you'll miss about half of the best commands. HELP
SYSTAT will give a thorough overview of the system setup & status program.

              RUN $SYSTAT (or just SYS if the Concise Command Language is set
up normally).  On the left is a report of te system users including all
background jobs (print spoolers, batch processors and the like), their
keyboard, and what state they are in (RN=run, ^C=waiting for input, DCL=logged
on, no program running, DR=Disk Read, DW=Disk Write).  To the right is a list
of busy I/O devices.  At the end is a full report of Disk names (DR:=Hard, DU:=
floppy), and space allocated/free.  To cause some havoc pick a target KB,
preferrably one running a financial type program.  Note the Job 
leftmost column.  Simply type UT KILL  and he's totally gone, without so much
as a logoff message.  If done during a Disk Write - get out the backups!!

        If just tying up resources is more your game, RUN $VT50PY.  It gives
the utilization readout on a 20 second basis, or whenever a key is struck.  The
program itself uses a lot of CPU time, so when the Interval <20>? comes up,
enter a 1 and watch the EXEC percent go through the roof.

        If wasting paper is more your style, find the KB: number of the printer
(KB0: is the console) from SYSTAT when it's in use, or try LP1:.  Find a long
text file (DIR [*,*]*.txt) and COPY LP1:=filename.  Don't forget the colon when
referring to keyboards or printers.

        Try DTR.  If DATATRIEVE is online, you can set up a database of huge
proportions.  Again, full help is available.  SET GUIDE (configure your
terminal for VT-100) and it takes you through every step.

MCI Cracks Down
---------------

Dr. Crash busted for MCI scanning.  In the early part of December, Dr. Crash
ran a scanner on MCI, MCI traced him and told him to stop, unfortunately Dr.
Hack, another 314er, started scanning the same port later that night.  MCI
didn't trace it again and assumed it was Dr. Crash back at work.  All of his
files were hidden away but MCI and authorities confiscated his Atari computer
and his phone.  MCI security told Dr. Crash that he was part of an ongoing
investigation.  Later that month he had a meeting with MCI security, where they
questioned him about the incident.  His computer, they told him, will arrive in
the mail soon.

Extasyy Elite Disbanded
-----------------------

The following data has not been completely researched and may be considered as
rumors. Bit Blitz busted for phreaking, the organization and enforcement
agencies are unknown. However, $3000 worth of computer material (7 computers)
were confiscated.  Also it is reported that The Mentor informed on him.

The Mentor was busted for breaking into his school to steal 29 computers. Also
it has been said that Poltergeist is in the hospital with leukemia.
It is unknown if any other members were busted for any other reasons. However,
all former members are apparently safe now.

The Bit Blitz and Crustaceo Mutoid are supposedly forming a new group called
Rising Force and The Mentor is starting an elite hacking group.

     Much of this information has been supplied by former Extasyy member:

Legion of Doom Vs. Stronghold East Elite
----------------------------------------
Somehow The Maelstrom found the secret LOD VMS in 305, and decided to post
about it on Stronghold East.  Knight Lightning spoke with Compu-Phreak of the
LOD, and he said that he told Slave Driver, co-sysop of Stronghold East, to
remove all posts concerning the LOD VMS, and the LOD itself.  He also
threatened that failure to do so would bring down the wrath of the 6 most
active members of the LOD.

When last looked at Stronghold East still had the information online.

The LOD VMS has 96 megs online and store information in a way similar to
laserdisc.

All readers are encouraged NOT to call it as Compu-Phreak is getting pissed
and you don't have the passwords anyway.

Dartmouth Abandoned
-------------------
With the destruction of the 58107s 12-27-65 password to the Dartmouth system,
it seems to have been abandoned by phreaks.  This is good because basically it
only causes trouble.  Many users get impersonated on that system and false
rumors are constantly being started.  The best way to have a conference is a
tele-conference...start one today!
