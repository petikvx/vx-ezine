A VRS (Voice Response System) is a computer system that is called using
a normal DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) telephone and interacted with
by speaking or by pressing buttons on the telephone keypad.

This article will discuss three such systems which are used by LLC Local
Loop Carriers (LLCs) to maintain the Public Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN). The systems are:

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Harris Corporation's DATU Loop Conditioning System combines a full
range of advanced features with unmatched versatility to help maximize
field testing and conditioning capabilities. The DATU system extends the
field technicians testing capabilities of subscriber lines through the
non-metallic environment of a pair gain system.

DATU is a printed wiring card that employs micro-processor control of
test functions and provides voice prompting. The card is installed in
the Metallic Facility Terminal (MFT) frame and connected through a
No-Test trunk to a switching facility. It may be used with most types of
Central Offices (CO) including SXS, Crossbar, ESS and DMS.

The DATU system can include the Pair Gain Applique (PGA) II, located
with the DATU system at the CO, and the Metallic Access Unit (MAU),
which is mounted within a remote terminal.

PGA units allow testing of subscriber lines being served through an
SLC-96 pair gain system. The PGA provides an interface between the DATU
and a Pair Gain Control Unit. The DATU will transmit tones to assist in
determining the status of the carrier channel. When a subscriber line is
being served by a pair-gain-system and the DATU is used to test it, a
warble tone is heard. The warble tone is followed by either a single
one-second tone, two one-second tones, or three one-second tones. This
indicates either a single party channel, multi party channel or a coin
channel. The absence of a tone indicates trouble with the channel or
channel equipment.


Features
~~~~~~~~

AUDIO MONITOR - The subscriber line may be monitored for up to 10
minutes, after which time the DATU disconnects from the No-Test trunk.
Audio Monitor may be used on either busy or idle lines. Traffic on a
busy line will be audible but unintelligible. The Audio Monitor Mode may
be exited before the end of the 10 minute period by selecting an
appropriate test function.

OPEN LINE - Opens subscriber line by removing battery and ground.

SHORT LINE - A metallic short is placed across the tip and ring of the
subscriber line.

SHORT TO GROUND - A metallic connection between tip, ring, and ground.
This feature is not available on a busy line.

TIP TO GROUND - A metallic connection between tip and ground with the
ring open.

RING TO GROUND - A metallic connection between ring and ground with the
tip open.

HIGH LEVEL TEST TONE - A high level 577Hz metallic-tracing tone,
interrupted four times per second, for identity purposes. The High Level
Test Tone is not available on a busy line.

HIGH LEVEL TONE ON TIP - Test tone is placed only on the tip side of the
line, with the ring side grounded.

HIGH LEVEL TONE ON RING - Test tone is placed only on the ring side of
the line, with the tip side grounded.

LOW LEVEL TEST TONE - A low level 577Hz simplex-tracing tone,
interrupted four times per second, for identity purposes. The Low Level
Test Tone may be applied even if the line under test is busy, and it
will not disturb traffic on that line. Note that on some No.5 ESS
switches, Simplex tone may not transmit.

SINGLE LINE ACCESS - Allows conditioning functions on the same line used
to access the DATU system.

HOLD - Used to continue a line preparation function after disconnecting
from the system's access line.

FORCED DISCONNECT - Allows the technician to disconnect from the system
at any time by dialing ##.

ADMINISTRATIVE - Password protection for both user and administrator
modes of access. System usage counters and timers are accessible through
interactive voice response.

Small Office Loop Testing System (SOLTS) is a system used by telephone
company field repair personnel to test a phone line from any touch-tone
telephone.

When dialing a SOLTS number, the first prompt is:

        ~Please enter ID, terminate with #~

SOLTS allows 30 seconds to enter a correct ID, then prompts:

        ~Please enter line number and press #~

SOLTS allows 60 seconds to enter a line number, then prompts:

        ~Select mode, for help enter 0~

SOLTS allows 60 seconds to choose one of six options:


Enter:

1) Interactive Testing
2) Calling on test line
3) Retrieve results
8) Hang up
9) Enter line number
0) Help


Option one allows testing the telephone line connected to the number
entered in step two above. Option two tests the line the technician is
calling from. Option three is used to retrieve the results generated
using options one and two. Option eight disconnects from the system.
Option nine allows a new line number to be entered for testing. Option
zero accesses on-line help.

When calling FAST, the first prompt is a request for a security code.
The security code is usually the employee badge number. After the
security code is entered and the # key is pressed, FAST will prompt for
the password. The password is usually 4-7 digits long and usually
expires every 30 days. The default password is usually the security
code. After the password is entered and the # key is pressed the FAST
New Notices and Features are played.

After all of that, the FAST Main Menu is made available:
