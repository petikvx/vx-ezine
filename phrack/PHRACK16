BELLCORE Information          by The Mad Phone-man
--------------------------------------------------------------------

So, you've broken  into the  big phone box on the wall, and are looking at a
bunch of tags with numbers and letters on them. Which one is the modem line?
Which one is the 1-800 WATS line?  Which one is the Alarm line? Bell has a
specific set of codes that enable you to identify what you're looking at.
These are the same codes the installer gets from the wire center to enable him
to set  up the line, test it, and make  sure it  matches the  customers order.
Here are some extracts from the Bellcore book.

First lets take a hypothetical line number I'm familiar with:
     64FDDV 123456
-------------------------------------------------------------
The serial number format:

        Prefix +  service code + modifier +   serial number +
digits:  1,2         3,4           5,6       7,8,9,10,11,12    continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Suffix    +  CO assigning circuit number +   segment
digits:  13,14,15            16,17,18,19              20,21,22
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The important shit is in the 3rd thru 6th digit.

So 64FDDV would be a private line data circuit terminating at a  radiocommon
carrier.  Other examples can be decoded likewise.

Enjoy this information as much as I've had finding it.

Author's Note:
--------------
This file is the first of two files dealing with PRIMOS and its operations.
The next file will be in circulation soon so be sure to check it out at any
good BBS.


Preface:
--------
This file is written in a form to teach beginners as well as experienced
Primos users about the system. It is written primarily for beginners however.
PRIMOS, contrary to popular belief can be a very powerful system if used
correctly.  I have  outlined some  VERY BASIC  commands and  their use in this
file along with some extra commands, not so BASIC.


Logging On To A PRIMOS:
-----------------------
A PRIMOS system is best recognized by its unusual prompts. These are: 'OK',
and 'ER!'.  Once connected, these are not the prompts you get.  The System
should identify itself with a login such as:

Primenet V2.3
-or-
Primecom Network

The  system then  expects some  input from  you,preferably:  LOGIN.  You will
then be asked to enter  your user  identification and  password as  a security
measure.  The login onto a PRIMOS is as follows:

CONNECT
Primenet V 2.3 (system)
LOGIN<CR>      (you)
User id?       (system)
AA1234         (you)
Password?      (system)
KILLME         (you)
OK,            (system)


Preceding the OK, will be the systems opening message.  Note that if you fail
to type login once connected, most other commands are ignored and the system
responds with:

Please Login
ER!


Logging Off Of A PRIMOS:
------------------------
If at any time you get bored with Primos, just type 'LOGOFF' to leave the
system.  Some systems have a TIMEOUT feature implemented meaning that if you
fail to type anything for the specified amount of time the system will
automatically log you out, telling you something like:

Maximum Inactive Time Limit Exceeded


System Prompts:
---------------
As stated previously, the prompts 'ER!' and 'OK,' are used on Primos. The
'OK,' denotes that last command was executed properly and it is now waiting
for your next command. The 'ER!' prompt denotes that you made an error in
typing  your last  command.  This  prompt is  usually  preceded  by  an  error
message.


Special Characters:
-------------------
Some terminals have certain characteristics that are built in to the terminal.
key

CONTROL-H
Deletes the last character typed.


Other Special Characters:
-------------------------
RETURN:  The return key signals PRIMOS that you have completed typing a
         command and that you are ready for PRIMOS to process the command.

BREAK/CONTROL-P:  Stops whatever is currently being processed in memory and
                  will return PRIMOS to your control.  To restart a process,
                  type:
                  START (abbreviated with S).

CONTROL-S:  Stops the scrolling of the output on your terminal for viewing.

CONTROL-Q:  Resumes the output scrolling on your terminal for inspection.

SEMICOLON ';':  The logical end of line character.  The semicolon is used to
                enter more than one command on one line.

Getting Help:
-------------
You can get on-line information about the available PRIMOS commands by using
the 'HELP' command.  The HELP system is keyword driven.  That is, all
information is stored under keywords that indicate the content of the help
files.  This is similar to VAX.  Entering the single command 'HELP' will enter
the HELP sub-system and will display an informative page of text.  The next
page displayed will provide you with a list of topics and their keywords.
These topics include such items as PRIME, RAP, MAIL, and DOC.  If you entered
the MAIL keyword, you would be given information concerning the mail sub-
system available to users on P simply enter PRIME to obtain information on all
PRIMOS commands.  You could then enter COPY to obtain information on that
specific topic.


Files And Directories:
----------------------
The name of a file or sub-directory may have up to 32 characters.  The
filename may contain any of the following characters, with the only
restriction being that the first character of the filename may not be a digit.
Please note that BLANK spaces are NOT allowed ANYWHERE:

A-Z .....alphabet
0-9 .....numeric digits
&   .....ampersand
#   .....pound sign
$   .....dollar sign
-   .....dash/minus sign
*   .....asterisk/star
.   .....period/dot
/   .....slash/divide sign


Naming Conventions:
-------------------
There are very few restrictions on the name that you may give a file.
However, you should note that many of the compilers (language processors) and
commands on the PRIME will make certain assumptions if you follow certain
guidelines. File name suffixes help to identify the file contents with regard
to the language the source code was written in and the contents of the file.
For instance, if you wrote a PL/1 program and named the file containing the
source code 'PROG1.PL1' (SEGmented loader) would take the binary file, link
all the binary libraries that you specify and produce a file named
'PROG1.SEG', which would contain the binary code necessary to execute the
program.  Some common filename suffixes are:  F77, PAS, COBOL, PL1G, BASIC,
FTN, CC, SPIT (source  files).  These all  denote  separate languages  and get
into more advanced programming on PRIMOS.  (e.g. FTN=Fortran).

BIN=the binary code produced by the compiler
LIST=the program listing produced by the compiler
SEG=the linked binary code produced by SEG

Some files which do not use standard suffixes may instead use the filename
prefixes to identify the contents of the file.  Some common filename prefixes
are:

B  Binary code produced by the compiler
L  source program Listing
C  Command files
$  Temporary work files (e.g. T$0000)
#  Seg files


Commands For File Handling:
----------------------------
PRIMOS has several commands to control and access files and file contents.
These commands can be used to list the contents of files and directories, and
to copy, add, delete, edit, and print the contents of files.  The capitalized
letters of each are deleted.  A LIST must be enclosed in parenthesis.

Close arg        ....Closes the file specified by 'arg'.  'Arg' could also be
                 a list of PRIMOS file unit numbers, or the word 'ALL' which
                 closes all open files and units.

LIMITS           ....Displays information about the login account, including
                 information about resources allocated and used, grantor, and
                 expiration date.

Edit Access      ....Edits the Access rights for the named directories and
                 files.

CName arg1 arg2  ....Changes the Name of 'arg1' to 'arg2'.  The arguments can
                 be files or directories.

LD               ....The List Directory command has several arguments that
                 allow for controlled listing format and selection of entries.

Attach arg       ....allows you to Attach to the directory 'arg' with the
                 access rights specified in the directory Access Control List.

DOWN <arg>       ....allows you to go 'DOWN into' a sub-ufd (directory).  You
                 can specify which one of several sub-ufds to descend into
                 with the optional 'arg'.

UP <arg>         ....allows you to go 'UP into' a higher ufd (directory).  You
                 can specify which one of several to climb into with the
                 optional 'arg'.

WHERE            ....Displays what the current directory attach point is and
                 your access rights.

CREATE arg       ....CREATES a new sub-directory as specified by 'arg'.

COPY arg1 arg2   ....COPIES the file or directory specified by 'arg1' into a
                 file by the same name specified by 'arg2'.  Both 'arg1' and
                 'arg2' can be filename with the SPOOL command, whose format
                 is:

SPOOL filename -AT destination
                 where filename is the name of the file you want printed, and
                 destination is the name of the printer where you want the
                 file printed.  For example if you want the file 'HACK.FTN'
                 printed at the destination 'LIB' type:

SPOOL HACK.FTN -AT LIB

PRIMOS then gives you some information telling you that the file named was
SPOOLed and the length of the file in PRIMOS records. To see the entries in
the SPOOL queue, type:

SPOOL -LIST

PRIMOS then lists out all the files waiting to be printed on the printers on
your login system. Also included in this information will be the filename of
the files waiting to print, the login account name of the user who SPOOLed the
file, the time that the file was SPOOLed, the size of the file in PRIMOS
records, and the printer name where the file is to print.


Changing The Password Of An Account:
------------------------------------
If you wish to change the password to your newly acquired account you must use
the 'CPW' command (Change PassWord).  To do this enter the current password on
the command line followed by RETURN.  PRIMOS will then prompt you for your
desired NEW password and then ask you to confirm your NEW password.  To change
your password of 'JOE' to 'SCHMOE' then type:

OK,             (system)
CPW JOE         (you)
New Password?   (system)

You can save a copy of your terminal session by using the COMO (COMmand
Output) command.  When you type:

COMO filename

Everything which is typed or displayed on your terminal is saved (recorded)
into the filename  on the command line (filename).  If a file by the same name
exists, then that file will be REPLACED with NO WARNING GIVEN!  When you have
finished doing whatever it was you wanted a hardcopy of, you type:

COMO -End

which will stop recording your session and will close the COMO file. You can
now print the COMO file using the SPOOL command as stated earlier.

Conclusion:
-----------
This  concludes  this  first  file on PRIMOS.  Please  remember this  file  is
written primarily for beginners, and some of  the text may have seemed BORING!
However, this filewaswrittenin  a verbose fashion to FULLYINTRODUCEPRIMOS
to beginners.  Part II will deal with more the several languages on PRIMOS and
some other commands.

Hacking the Global Telecommunications Network
Researched and written by:  The Kurgan
Compiled on 10/5/87


Network Procedure Differences

The Global Telecommunications Network (GTN) is Citibanks's international data
network, which allows Citicorp customers and personnel to access Citibank's
worldwide computerized services.

Two different sign on procedures exist: Type A and Type B.  All users, except
some  in  the U.S., must use Type B.  (U.S. users: the number  you dial into
and  the  Welcome  Banner  you  receive  determine  what  sign-on procedure to
follow.)  Welcome banners are as follows:

TYPE A:
WELCOME TO CITIBANK. PLEASE SIGN ON.
XXXXXXXX

@
PASSWORD =

@

TYPE B:
PLEASE ENTER YOUR ID:-1->
PLEASE ENTER YOUR PASSWORD:-2->

CITICORP (CITY NAME). KEY GHELP FOR HELP.
  XXX.XXX
 PLEASE SELECT SERVICE REQUIRED.-3->


Type A User Commands

User commands are either instructions or information you send to the network
for it to follow.  The commands available are listed below.

User Action:  Purpose:

@ (CR)   To put you in command mode (mode in which you can put
         your currently active service on hold and ask the network
         for information, or log-off the service).  (NOTE: This
         symbol also serves as the network prompt; see Type A
         messages.)

BYE (CR)  To leave service from command mode.

Continue (CR)  To return to application from command mode (off hold)

D (CR)                  To leave service from command mode.

ID                      To be recognized as a user by the network (beginning of
                        sign on procedure), type ID, then a space and your
                        assigned network ID.  (Usually 5 or 6 characters long)

Status (CR)             To see a listing of network address (only from @
                        prompt).  You need this address when "reporting a
                        problem."

Type A messages

The network displays a variety of messages on your screen which either require
a user command or provide you with information.

Screen shows:  Explanation:

@   Network prompt -- request for Network ID.

BAD PASSWORD  Network does not except your password.

<address> BUSY          The address is busy, try back later.


WELCOME TO CITIBANK.    Network welcome banner.  Second line provides address
PLEASE SIGN ON.         # to be used when reporting "problems."
XXX.XXX

<address> ILLEGAL       You typed in an address that doesn't exist.

<address> CONNECTED     Your connection has been established.

DISCONNECTED            Your connect has been disconnected.

NOT CONNECTED           You're not connected to any service at the time.

NUI REQUIRED            Enter your network user ID.

PASSWORD =              Request for your assigned password.

STILL CONNECTED         You are still connected to the service you were using.

?                       Network doesn't understand your entry.


Type B User Commands and Messages

Since the Type B procedure is used with GTN dial-ups, it requires fewer
commands to control the network.  There is only 1 Type B command.  Break plus
(CR) allows you to retain connection to one service, and connect with another.


Screen Shows:  Explanation:

CITICORP (CITY NAME).   Network Welcome banner.  Type in service address.
 PLEASE SELECT SERVICE

COM   Connection made.

DER   The port is closed out of order, or no open routes are
      available.

DISCONNECTED  You have disconnected from the service and the network.

ERR   Error in service selected.

INV   Error in system.

MOM   Wait, the connection is being made.

NA    Not authorized for this service.

NC    Circuits busy, try again.

NP    Check service address.

OCC   Service busy, try again.


Sign-on Procedures:

  There are two types of sign on procedures.  Type A and Type B.


Type A:

To log onto a system with type A logon procedure, the easiest way is through
Telenet.  Dial your local Telenet port.  When you receive the "@" prompt, type
in the Type-A service address (found later in the article) then follow the
instructions from there on.

  Type-B:
    Dial the your GTN telephone #, then hit return twice.  You will then see:

"PLEASE ENTER YOUR ID:-1->"

Type in a network ID number and hit return.

    You will then see

"PLEASE ENTER YOUR PASSWORD:-2->"

     Type in Network Password and hit return.

    Finally you will see the "CITICORP (city name)" welcome banner, and it
will ask you to select the service you wish to log onto.  Type the address and
hit return.  (A list of addresses will be provided later)

Trouble Shooting:

    If you should run into any problems, the Citicorp personnel will gladly
help their "employees" with any questions.  Just pretend you work for Citibank
and they will give you a lot.  This has been tried and tested.  Many times,
when you attempt to log on to a system and you make a mistake with the
password, the system will give you a number to call for help.  Call it and
tell them that you forgot your pass or something.  It usually works, since
they don't expect people to be lying to them.  If you have any questions about
the network itself, call 305-975-5223.  It is the Technical Operations Center
(TOC) in Pompano, Florida.

Dial-Ups:

    The following list of dial-ups is for North America.  I have a list of
others, but I don't think that they would be required by anyone.  Remember:
Dial-ups require Type-B log-on procedure.  Type-A is available on systems
accessible through Telenet.

Canada Toronto       416-947-2992     (1200 Baud V.22 Modem Standard)
U.S.A. Los Angeles   213-629-4025     (300/1200 Baud U.S.A. Modem Standard)

       New York City 212-269-1274
                     212-809-1164

                (A Tom Brokaw/Disk Jockey Law File Production)


Introduction:
------------

     In this article, I will try to explain the laws concerning the illegal
use of credit cards.  Explained will be the Michigan legislative view on the
misuse and definition of credit cards.


Definition:
----------

     Well, Michigan Law section 157, defines a credit card as  "Any instrument
or device which is sold, issued or otherwise distributed by a business
organization identified thereon for obtaining goods, property, services or
anything of value."  A credit card holder is defined as: 1) "The person or
organization who requests a credit card and to whom or for whose benefit a
credit card is subsequently issued" or  2) "The person or organization to whom
a credit  card was  issued and  who uses a credit card whether the issuance of
the credit card was requested or not."  In other words, if the company or
individual is issued a card, once using it, they automatically agree to all
the laws and conditions that bind it.


Stealing, Removing, Retaining or Concealment:
--------------------------------------------

     Michigan Law states, that it is illegal to "steal, knowingly take or
remove a credit card from a card holder." It also states that it is wrongful
to "conceal a credit card  without the consent of the card holder."  Notice
that it doesn't say anything about carbons  or numbers acquired from BBSes,
but I think that it could be considered part of the laws governing the access
of a persons account without the knowledge of the cardholder, as described
above.


Possession with Intent to Circulate or Sell
-------------------------------------------

     The law states that it is illegal to possess or have under one's control,
or receive a credit card if his  intent is to circulate or sell the card.  It
is also illegal to deliver, circulate or sell a credit card, knowing that such
a possession, control or receipt without the cardholders consent, shall be
guilty of a FELONY.  Notice again, they say nothing about possession of
carbons or numbers directly.  It also does not clearly state what circulation
or possession is, so we can only stipulate.  All it says is that possession of
a card (material plastic) is illegal.


Fraud, forgery, material alteration, counterfeiting.
----------------------------------------------------

     However, it might not be clearly illegal to possess a carbon or CC
number.  It IS illegal to defraud  a credit card holder.   Michigan law states
that any person who, with intent to defraud, forge, materially alter or
counterfeit a credit card, shall be guilty of a felony.


Revoked or cancelled card, use with intent to defraud.
------------------------------------------------------

    This states that "Any person who knowingly and with intent to defraud for
the purpose of obtaining goods, property or services or anything of value on a
credit card which has been revoked or cancelled or reported stolen by the
issuer or issuee, has been notified of the cancellation by registered or
certified mail or by another personal service shall be fined not more than
$1,000 and not imprisoned not more than a year, or both.  However, it does not
clearly say if it is a felony or misdemeanor or civil infraction.  My guess is
that it would be dependant on the amount and means that you used and received
when  you  defraud  the  company.   Usually,  if  it is  under  $100,  it is a
misdemeanor  but if it is over $100, it is a felony.  I guess they figure that
you should know these things.


The People of The State of Michigan vs. Anderson     (possession)
------------------------------------------------

     On April 4, 1980, H. Anderson attempted to purchase a pair of pants at
Danny's Fashion Shops, in the Detroit area.  He went up to the cashier to pay
for the pants and the cashier asked him if he had permission to use the credit
card.  He said "No, I won it last night in a card game".  The guy said that I
could purchase $50 dollars worth of goods to pay back the debt.  At the same
time, he presumed the card to be a valid one and not stolen.  Well, as it
turned out it was stolen but he had no knowledge of this.  Later, he went to
court and pleased guilty of attempted possession of a credit card of another
with intent or circulate or sell the same.  At the guilty hearings, Mr.
Anderson stated that the credit card that he attempted to use had been
acquired by him in payment of a gambling debt and assumed that the person was
the owner. The trial court accepted his plea of guilty.  At the sentencing,
Mr. Anderson, denied that he had any criminal intent.  Anderson appealed the
decision stating that the court had erred by accepting his plea of guilty on
the basis of insufficient factual data.  Therefore, the trial court should not
have convicted him of attempted possession and reversed the charges.


The People of the State of Michigan vs. Willie Dockery
------------------------------------------------------

     On June 23, 1977, Willie Dockery attempted to purchase gas at a Sears gas
station  by  using  a  stolen  credit  card. The  attendant noticed  that his
driver's license  picture was  pasted on  and  notified  the police.   Dockery
stated that he had found the credit  card and the license at an intersection,
in the city of Flint.  He admitted that  he knowingly used the credit card and
driver's license without the consent of the owner but he said that he only had
purchased  gasoline  on  the  card.  It  turns  out  that  the credit card and
driver's  license was  stolen from a man, whose grocery store had been robbed.
Dockery said  that he  had no knowledge of the robbery and previous charges on
the cardwhich totalled$1,373.21.  He admitted that he did paste his picture
on the driver's license.  Butagain the court screws up, they receive evidence
that the defendant had a record of felonies dating back to when he was sixteen
and then assumed that  he was guilty on  the basis of his prior offenses.  The
judge later said that  the present  sentence could  not stand in this court so
the case was referred to another court.


Conclusion
----------

     I hope that I have given you a better understanding about the law, that
considers the illegal aspects of using credit cards.  All this information was
taken from The Michigan Compiled Laws Annotated Volume 754.157a-s and from The
Michigan Appeals Report.

In my next file I will talk about the laws concerning Check Fraud.

Written by Agent Steal 08/87


  Included in this file is...

      * Equipment needed

      * Where to buy it

      * How to connect it

      * How to read recorded data


  But wait!!  There's more!!

      * How I found a Tymnet node

      * How I got in



*************
THE EQUIPMENT
*************

    First  thing you  need  is  an  audio  tape  recorder.   What you  will be
recording, whether  it be  voice or  data, will  be in an analog audio format.
>From now  on, most references  will be  towards data recording.  Most standard
cassette recorders will work  just fine.  However,  you are limited  to 1 hour
recording time  per side.   This can  present a problem in some situations.  A
reel to reel can also be used.  The limitations here are size and availability
of A.C.  Also, some  reel to  reels lack  a remote  jack that will be used to
start  and stop  the recorder  while the  line is being  used.   This  may not
present  a problem.   More later.  The two  types of recorders I would advise
staying away from (for data) are the micro cassette recorders and the standard
cassette recorders that have been modified for 8 to 10 hour record time.  The
speed  of these  units is too unstable.  The next item you need, oddly enough,
is  sold by  Radio Shack  under the  name "Telephone  recording control"  part
# 43-236 $24.95.  See page 153 of the 1987 Radio Shack catalog.



*****************
HOW TO CONNECT IT
*****************

  The Telephone recording control (TRC) has 3 wires coming out of it.

  #1 Telco wire with modular jack.  Cut this and replace with alligator clips.

  #2 Audio wire with miniature phone jack (not telephone).  This plugs
     into the microphone level input jack of the tape recorder.

  #3 Audio wire with sub miniature phone jack.  This plugs into the "REM"
     or remote control jack of the tape recorder.

    Now all you need to do is find the telephone line, connect the alligator
clips, turn the recorder on, and come back later.  Whenever the line goes off
hook, the recorder starts.  It's that simple.



****************
READING THE DATA
****************

    This is the tricky part.  Different modems and different software respond
differently but there are basics.  The modem should be connected as usual to
the telco line and computer.  Now connect the speaker output of the tape
player directly to the telephone line.  Pick up the phone and dial the high
side of a loop so your line doesn't make a lot of noise and garble up your
data.  Now, command your modem into the answer mode and press play.  The tape
should be lined up at the beginning of the recorded phone call, naturally, so
you can see the login.  Only one side of the transmission between the host and
terminal can be monitored at a time.  Going to the originate mode you will see
what the host transmitted.  This will include the echoes of the terminal. Of
course the password will be echoed as ####### for example, but going to the
answer mode will display exactly what the terminal typed.  You'll understand
when you see it.  A couple of problems you might run into will be hum and
garbage characters on the screen.  Try connecting the speaker output to the
microphone of the hand set in your phone.  Use a 1 to 1 coupling transformer
between the tape player input and the TRC audio output.  These problems are
usually caused when using A.C. powered equipment.  The common ground of this
equipment interferes with the telco ground which is D.C. based.

    I was a little reluctant to write this file because I have been
unsuccessful in reading any of the 1200 baud data I have recorded.  I have
spoke with engineers and techs.  Even one of the engineers who designs modems.
All of them agree that it IS possible, but can't tell me why I am unable to do
this.  I believe that the problems is in my cheap ass modem.  One tech told me
I needed a modem with phase equalization circuitry which is found in most
expensive 2400 baud modems.  Well one of these days I'll find $500 lying on
the street and I'll have nothing better to spend it on!  Ha!  Actually, I have
a plan and that's another file.....

    I should point out one way of reading 1200 baud data.  This should work in
theory, however, I have not attempted it.

    Any fully Hayes compatible modem has a command that shuts off the carrier
and allows you to monitor the phone line.  The command is ATS10.  You would
then type either answer or originate depending on who you wanted to monitor.
It would be possible to write a program that records the first 300 or so
characters then writes it to disk, thus allowing unattended operation.

HOW CRAZY I AM

  PASSWORDS GALORE!!!!

    After numerous calls to several Bell offices, I found the one that handled
Tymnet's account.  Here's a rough transcript:

Op:  Pacific Bell priority customer order dept.  How may I help you?
Me:  Good Morning, this is Mr. Miller with Tymnet Inc.  We're interested in
     adding some service to our x town location.
Op:  I'll be happy to help you Mr. Miller.
Me:  I need to know how many lines we have coming in on our rotary and if we
     have extra pairs on our trunk.  We are considering adding ten additional
     lines on that rotary and maybe some FX service.
Op:  Ok....What's the number this is referenced to?
Me:  xxx-xxx-xxxx (local node #)
Op:  Hold on a min....Ok bla, bla, bla.

    Well you get the idea.  Anyway, after asking her a few more unimportant
questions I asked her for the address.  No problem, she didn't even hesitate.
Of course this could have been avoided if the CN/A in my area would give out
addresses, but they don't, just listings.  Dressed in my best telco outfit,
Pac*Bell baseball cap, tool belt and  test set, I was out the door.  There it
was, just  an office  building, even  had  a  computer  store  in  it.   After
exploring the building for awhile, I found it.  A large steel door with a push
button lock.  Back to the phone.  After finding the  number where  the service
techs were I called it and talked to the tech manager.

Mgr:  Hello this is Joe Moron.
Me:   Hi this is Mr. Miller (I like that name) with Pacific Bell.  I'm down
      here at your x town node and we're having problems locating a gas leak
      in one of our Trunks.  I believe our trunk terminates pressurization in
      your room.
Mgr:  I'm not sure...
Me:   Well could you have someone meet me down here or give me the entry code?
Mgr:  Sure the code is 1234.
Me:   Thanks, I'll let you know if there's any trouble.


    So, I ran home, got my VCR (stereo), and picked up another TRC from Trash
Shack.  I connected  the VCR to  the first  two incoming  lines on the rotary.
One went  to each channel (left,right).  Since the volume of calls is almost
consistent, it wasn't necessary to stop the recorder between calls.  I just
let it run.  I would come back the next day to change the tape.  The VCR was
placed under the floor in case a tech happened to come by for maintenance.
These nodes are little computer rooms with air conditioners and raised floors.
The modems and packet switching equipment are all rack mounted behind glass.
Also, most of the nodes are unmanned.  What did I get?  Well a lot of the
logins were 1200, so I never found out what they were.  Still have 'em on tape
though!  Also a large portion of traffic on both Tymnet and Telenet is those
little credit card verification machines calling up Visa or Amex.  The
transaction takes about 30 secs and there are 100's on my tapes.  The rest is
as follows:

   Easylink          CompuServe        Quantumlink       3Mmail
   PeopleLink        Homebanking       USPS              Chrysler parts order
   Yamaha            Ford              Dow Jones

    And a few other misc. systems of little interest.  I'm sure if I was
persistent, I'd get something a little more interesting.  I spent several
months trying to figure out my 1200 baud problem.  When I went back down there
the code had been changed.  Why?  Well I didn't want to find out.  I was out
of there!  I had told a couple of people who I later found could not be
trusted.  Oh well.  Better safe than sorry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file is dedicated to all the phreaks/hacks that were busted in the summer
of 1987, perhaps one of the most crippling summers ever for us.

Preface:
-------
     Trans-Union is a credit service much like CBI, TRW or Chilton, but offers
more competitive rates, and is being used more and more by many credit
checking agencies.

Logging in:
----------
     Call one of the Trans Union dial-ups at 300,E,7,1, Half Duplex. Such a
dial-up is 314-XXX-XXXX.  After connecting, hit Ctrl-S.  The system will echo
back a 'GO ' and then awaits you to begin the procedure of entering the
account and  password, then  mode, i.e.:  S F1111,111,H,T.   The system  will
then  tell  you  what  database  you  are  logged  on  to,  which  is   mostly
insignificant  for your use.  To  then pull  a  report,  you  would  type  the
following:  P JONES,JIM* 2600,STREET,CHICAGO,IL,60604** <Ctrl-S>.   The name
is  Jim Jones, 2600 is his street address, street is the  street name, Chicago
is the city, IL is the state, 60604 is the zip.

The Report:
----------
     The report will come out, and will look rather odd, with all types of
notation.  An example of a Visa card would be:

SUB NAME/ACCT#   SUB#     OPEND  HICR DTRP/TERM BAL/MAX.DEL PAY.PAT   MOP

CITIBANK         B453411  3/87  $1000   9/87A    $0         12111     R01
4128XXXXXXXXX             $1500         5/87     $120


Ok, Citibank is the issuing bank.  B453411 is their subscriber code.  3/87 is
when the account was opened.  HICR is the most that has been spent on that
card.  9/87 is when the report was last updated (usually monthly if active).
$1000 is the credit line.  $0 is the current balance.  12111 is the payment
pattern, where 1=pays in 30 days and 2=pays in 60 days. R01 means that it is a
"Revolving" account, meaning that he can make payments rather than pay the
entire bill at once.  4128-etc is his account number (card number).  $1500 is
his credit line.  5/87 is when he was late on a payment last.  $120 is the
amount that he was late with.

Here is a list of terms that will help you identify and understand the reports
better:

>From the 9/16 San Francisco Chronicle, page A19:

GERMAN HACKERS BREAK INTO NASA NETWORK (excerpted)

Bonn
        A group of West German computer hobbyists broke into an international
computer network of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and
rummaged freely among the data for at least three months before they were
discovered, computer enthusiasts and network users said yesterday.

        An organization in Hamburg called the Chaos Computer Club, which
claimed to be speaking for an anonymous group that broke into the network,
said the illicit users managed to install a "Trojan horse," and gain entry
into 135 computers on the European network.

        A "Trojan  Horse" is a  term for  a  permanent  program  that  enables
amateur computer enthusiasts  [as opposed  to professionals?], or "hackers,"
to use a password to bypass  all the security  procedures of a system and gain
access to all the data in a target computer.

[Actually, this type of program is a 'back door' or a 'trap door.' The group
may very well have *used* a Trojan horse to enable them to create the back
door, but it probably wasn't a Trojan horse per se.  A Trojan horse is a
program that does something illicit and unknown to the user in addition to its
expected task.  See Phrack xx-x, "Unix Trojan Horses," for info on how to
create a Trojan horse which in turn creates a trap door into someone's
account.]

        The NASA network that was broken into is called the Space Physics
Analysis Network [ooh!] and is chiefly designed to provide authorized
scientists and organizations with access to NASA data.  The security system in
the network was supplied by an American company, the Digital Equipment Corp.
[Probably DECNET.  Serves them right.]  Users said the network is widely used
by scientists in the United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan and five
other countries and does not carry classified information.

        A Chaos club spokesman, Wau Holland, denied that any data had been
changed.  This, he said, went against "hacker ethics."

        West German television reports said that computer piracy carries a
penalty of three years in prison in West Germany.  The government has not said
what it plans to do.

        The Chaos club clearly views its break-in as a major coup.  Holland,
reached by telephone in Hamburg, said it was "the most successful running of a
Trojan horse" to his knowledge, and the club sent a lengthy telex message to
news organizations.

        It said the "Trojan horse" was spotted by a user in August, and the
infiltrating group then decided to go public because "they feared that they
had entered the dangerous field of industry espionage, economic crime, East-
West conflict...and the legitimate security interests of high-tech
institutions."

        The weekly magazine Stern carried an interview with several anonymous
hobbyists who showed how they gained access to the network.  One described his
excitement when for the first time he saw on his screen, "Welcome to the NASA
headquarters VAX installation."

        According to Chaos, the hobbyists discovered a gap in the Digital VAX
systems 4.4 and 4.5 and used it to install their "Trojan Horse."

request of the author]

                The Story of the Feds on XXXXXXX BBS
                By The Mad Phone Man

        Returninghome one afternoon with a friend, I knew something wasn't
right when I walked into the computer room.  I see a "Newuser" on the board...
and the language he's using is... well "Intimidating"...

"I want you all to know I'm with the OCC task force and we know who you are...
we are going to have a little get-together and 'talk' to you all."

     Hmmm... a loser?... I go into chat mode... "Hey dude, what's up?" I ask.
"Your number asshole" he says.... Well, fine way to log on to a board if I do
say.... "Hey, you know I talked to you and I know who you are.." "Oh
yeah...Who am I?." he hesitates and says... "Well uh.. you used to work for
Sprint didn't you?"
   I say, "No, you've got me confused with someone else I think, I'm a junior
in high school."
        "Ohyeah?.. You got some pretty big words for a high school kid," he
says....
        "Well, in case you didn't know, they teach English as a major these
days...."
        He says... "Do you really want to know which LD company I'm with?"
        I say "NO, but if it will make you happy, tell me."
        He  says  MCI.  (Whew! I  don't use  them)... "Well you're  outta luck
asshole, I pay for my calls, and I don't use MCI."  He's dumbfounded.
        I wish him the worst as  he asks  me to  leave his rather  threatening
post up on my board and we hang up on him.

        Now, I'm half paralyzed... hmmm.... Check his info-form... he left a
number in 303... Denver.... I grab the phone and call it.. It's the Stromberg
Telephone company... Bingo.. I've got him.
        I search my user files and come up with a user called "Cocheese" from
there, and I voice validated him, and he said he worked for a small telco
called Stromberg... I'm onto him now.
        Later in the week, I'm in a telco office in a nearby major city, I
happen  to  see a book,  marked "Confidential  Employee  Numbers for AT&T."  I
thumb thru and lo and behold, an R.F. Stromberg works at  an office of AT&T in
Denver, and I can't cross  reference him to  an office. (A sure sign he's in
security).  Well, not to be out-done by this loser... I dial up NCIC and check
for a group search for  a driver's licence for him... Bingo.  Licence number,
cars he owns, his SS  number, and a cross reference of the licence files finds
his wife, two kids and a boat registered to him.
        I've never called him back, but If I do have any trouble with him, I'm
gonna pay a little visit to Colorado....

      The Flight of The Mad Phone-Man's BBS to a Friendly Foreign Country


        Using my knowledge that the pigs grab your computer when they bust
you,I got real worried about  losing a BIG investment I've got in my IBM. I
decide  there's a  better way.... Move it!  But where? Where's safe  from the
PhBI?  Well  in the old days, to escape the draft, you went to Canada, why not
expatriate my board....  Well the  costs of  a line  are very  high, let's see
what's available elsewhere.
        One afternoon, I'm working at a local hospital,(one I do telecom work
for) and I  ask the  comm mgr  if they  have any links to Canada?  He says why
yes, we have  an inter-medical link over  a 23ghz microwave into the city just
across the border. I ask to  see the equipment.  WOW!  My dreams  come true,
it's a D4 bank (Rockwell) and it's only got 4 channel cards in it. Now, being
a "nice" guy, I offer to  do maintenance  on this equipment if he would let me
put up another channel...he agrees.  The plot thickens.
        I've got a satellite office for a business near the hospital on the
other side, I quickly call up good ole Bell Canada, and have them run a 2 wire
line from the equipment room to my office. Now the only thing to get is a
couple of cards to plug into the MUX to put me on the air.
        A 2 wire E&M card goes for bout $319, and I'd need two.  Ilook around
the state, and find one bad one in Rochester.... I'm on my way that afternoon
via motorcycle.  The card  is mine,  and the  only thing I can find wrong is a
bad  voltage regulator. I stop by  the Rockwell office in  suburban Rochester
and exchange  the card, while I'm there, I buy a second one (Yeah, on my card)
and drive home.... by 9pm that night the circuit is up, and we are on the air.
        Results- Very good line, no noise, can be converted with another card
for a  modest fee  if I want  the bandwidth.  So that's the  story of how the
board went to a "friendly foreign country."

Shadow Hawk Busted Again
========================

        As many of you know, Shadow Hawk (a/k/a Shadow Hawk 1) had his home
searched by agents of the FBI, Secret Service, and the Defense Criminal
Investigative Services and had some of his property confiscated by them on
September 4th.  We're not going to reprint the Washington Post article as it's
available through other sources.  Instead, a summary:

        In early July, SH bought an AT&T 3B1 ("Unix PC") with a 67MB drive for
a dirt-cheap $525.  He got Sys V 3.5 for another $200 but was dissatisfied
with much of the software they gave him (e.g. they gave him uucp version 1.1).

        When he was tagged by the feds, he had been downloading software (in
the form of C sources) from various AT&T systems.  According to reports, these
included the Bell Labs installations at Naperville, Illinois and Murray Hill,
New Jersey.  Prosecutors said he also gained entry to (and downloaded software
from) AT&T systems at a NATO installation in Burlington, North Carolina and
Robins AFB in Georgia.  AT&T claims he stole $1 million worth of software.
Some of it was unreleased software taken from the Bell Labs systems that was
given hypothetical price tags by Bell Labs spokespersons.  Agents took his
3B1, two Atari STs he had in his room, and several diskettes.

        SH is 17 and apparently will be treated as a minor.  At the time of
this writing, he will either be subject to federal prosecution for 'computer
theft' or will be subject to prosecution only by the State of Illinois.

        SH's lawyer,  Karen Plant, was quoted as saying that SH "categorically
denies doing anything that he should not have been doing" and that he "had
absolutely no sinister motives in terms of stealing property."  As we said, he
was just collecting software for his new Unix PC.  When I talked to Ms. Plant
on September 25th, she told me that she had no idea if or when the U.S.
Attorney would prosecute. Karen Plant can be  reached at (312) 263-1355.  Her
address is 134 North LaSalle, #306, Chicago, Illinois.

        So you see, I'm screwed. Oh yeah, even worse! In my infinite (wisdom
|| stupidity, take your pick 8-)) I set up a local AT&T owned 7300 to call me
up and send me their uucp files (my uucp works ok for receive) and guess what.
I don't think I've to elaborate further on THAT one... (holding my breath, so

         "Phone Companies Across U.S. Want Coins Box Thief's Number"
                  From the Tribune - Thursday, Nov. 5, 1987


 SAN FRANCISCO  -  Seven  telephone  companies  across  the country, including
   Pacific Bell, are so frazzled  by a coin box thief that they are offering a
   reward of $25,000 to catch him.

 He's very clever, telephone officials say,  and is the only known suspect  in
   the country  that is  able to  pick the  locks on  coin boxes  in telephone
   booths with relative ease.

 He is believed responsible for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from
   coin boxes in the Bay Area and Sacramento this year.

 The  suspect  has  been  identified  by  authorities  as  James Clark, 47, of
   Pennisula,  Ohio,  a  machinist  and  tool-and-die  maker,  who is believed
