I started on my way to hackerdom in early 1983 when I bought my first modem, a
Networker 300 baud (What a gem!!) to use in my Apple II+.  I asked the
salesperson for the numbers of the local boards (at the time there were a whole
3 here, and one was an IBM users group board).  Well, it just so happened one
was an Apple board run on an old version of Networks II, with a sysop who had
been known to rip off a local extender here and there.  After chatting with him
for a while he realized I was one of those eager-to-learn Jr. High kids, so he
put me in touch with several other users of his board.  Well, one of those was
Simon Templar, who would later be the sysop of the Pearly Gates, and I guess to
me, about as close a friend a phreak can have that lives 1000 miles a way.

Simon gave me my first code (to an 800 number owned by LDX), and the numbers of
some boards where I might pick up some more additional knowledge (IC's Socket,
AT&T Phone Center, and Sherwood Forest).  Well, after pestering just about
anybody that seemed to know ANYTHING, I was on my way.  Soon, I was frequenting
at least one board in almost every area code.  I also learned the advantage of
scanning exchanges, I found several local PBXes and a Sprint indial that nobody
seemed to known about.  That facilitated my "habit" even more and I then found
a little Diversi-Dial dubbed "Beandial."  That was where I really got off the
ground.  It was frequented by many knowledgeable phreaks, so between that and
all of the BBSes I was on, I had a wealth of knowledge to look to all at my
fingertips when I had a question.

Beandial also left me with several good friends, the most notable being Lord
Kahz.  It also put me in touch with someone rather well known, King Blotto (you
should have seen my face the night my phone rang and the guy at the other end
said "Hi, this is King Blotto, wanna be on my board?" and gave me the number!).
 As of the last several years, I have left the mainstream phreaking life, and
only look in once in a while through past friends.  That may change now, as
Taran King and Knight Lightning have shown me that there are in fact TRUE
phreaks left.  I was beginning to doubt it, hence my absence.

Memorable bulletin boards that I have been on include; The Pearly Gates, AT&T
Phone Center, Blottoland (even though I was only actually on during the last
phase of its life), and Bean Dial, plus all the normal ones that everybody and
his brother were on.

Currently I am enrolled at North Dakota State University, majoring in computer
engineering.  I work at McDonalds flippin' dem burgers.

Regrets
~~~~~~~
I regret leaving the phreak world in the first place, I was disillusioned
with all the little nerds with computers and modems who thought they were
phreaks just because some dork they knew gave them a code.


Favorite Things
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chicks:  The ones with really big...  uh..  Brains!  Thats it! Ya know, they
         stick out their bras..  Uh.. I mean their intelligence protrudes!!
         Ya! thats it!
People:  I like just about anybody who has something interesting and
         meaningful to talk about (and chicks with big ****)

Music:  70's music like Led Zeppelin, and most heavy metal bands.  I also can
        go for top 40 as long as we aren't talking Whitney, or Jackson, or G.
        Michael or some other puke like that.


Most Memorable Experiences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The time me and a friend from Idaho called this local guy who THOUGHT he was a
phreak.  I talked to him on one line, while MIKE talked to him long distance on
another, convincing him that AT&T security had really busted his ass.  I've
never heard ANYONE sound so scared in my life! HAHAH

Starting on my high school's varsity football team for two years instead of the
average 0-1 yr.


Some people to mention
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lord Kahz
Cookie Cruncher
Android Base -- for pointing me in the right direction
Simon Templar -- for taking that direction and showing me what to do with it.

All others who have helped me in anyway, whether it be questions I had, or
whatever else...  Thanks.


Inside Joke
~~~~~~~~~~~
To Kahz:  "Hey MM, let's call Mari!"

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Serious Section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I think people who abuse CCs are assholes.  That does nothing but hurt all of
us; all that comes out of it is one person's gain and many people's suffering.
Example; Sysops of the board where the inevitably BUSTED asshole posted his CC
numbers.

Although he has never met any hackers, Scott feels that there are a few geeks
out there based on some of his phone conversations.

Thanks for your time Scott.

The Problem?
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The fate of the entire modem community for the most part is based on the
foundation of computer bulletin boards.  These realms of information exchange
have become centers of learning and trading various information for thousands
of hackers across the United States and even the world.

However, today's security consultants and law enforcement agencies are smarter
than ever too and they know where to strike in order to do the most damage.
The concept of creating a bulletin board for the purpose of catching hackers
was unheard of until The Phoenix Phortress Incident of 1986.  The creation of
this bulletin board system enabled Sergeant Dan Pasquale of the Fremont Police
Department the ability to penetrate the sacred barrier between the phreak/hack
community and the rest of the world.

This file will attempt to show the extent of this problem within the community
and hopefully will lead readers to discover ways of protecting themselves from
the many "venus fly traps" they are likely to encounter.  Articles presented in
this file are specially edited reprints from past issues of Phrack World News.

Phoenix Phortress Stings 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On March 5, 1986, the following seven phreaks were arrested in what has come to
be known as the first computer crime "sting" operation.

           Captain Hacker \ Doctor Bob \ Lasertech \ The Adventurer
                  The Highwayman \ The Punisher \ The Warden

Many of them or other members of Phoenix Phortress belonged to these groups:

  High Mountain Hackers \ Kaos Inc. \ Shadow Brotherhood \ The Nihilist Order

Of the seven, three were 15 years old; two were 16; one was 17; and one, 19.

Their charges include:

Several misdemeanors
Trafficking in stolen long distance service codes
Trafficking in stolen credit card numbers
Possession of stolen property
Possession of dangerous weapons (a martial arts weapon)
Charging mail-order merchandise to stolen credit card numbers
Selling stolen property
Charging calls internationally to telephone service numbers

Other phreak boards mentioned include:

Bank Vault (Mainly for credit card numbers and tips on credit card scams)
Phreakers Phortress (Mainly of course for phreak codes and other information)

After serving search warrants early Wednesday morning on the seven Fremont
residences where the young men lived with their parents, police confiscated at
least $12,000 worth of equipment such as computers, modems, monitors, floppy
disks, and manuals, which contained information ranging from how to make a
bomb, to the access codes for the Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter Financial
Services Firm's corporate computers.

The sysop of Phoenix Phortress was The Revenger, who was supposedly Wally
Richards, a 25 year-old Hayward man who "phreaked back east a little" in New
Jersey.  He took the phone number under the name of Al Davis.  However he was
really Sgt. Daniel Pasquale of the Fremont Police Department.

When he introduced his board to other computer users, he called it the "newest,
coolest, phreak board in town."

Pasquale said he got the idea for the sting operation after a 16-year old
arrested last summer for possession of stolen property "rolled them over
(narced) He told us all about their operation."

Pasquale used a police department Apple //e computer and equipment, with access
codes and information provided by eight corporations, including Wells Fargo
Bank, Sprint, and MCI.

Pasquale said he received more than 2,500 calls from about 130 regular users
around the country.  The police started to make their first case three days
after the board went up.

"We had taken the unlisted phone number under the name Al Davis," Pasquale
said. "In six days, these kids had the name on the bulletin board.  I would
have needed a search warrant to get that information."

The arrests were made after five months of investigation by Dan Pasquale.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The Phoenix Phortress incident only led to the arrest of seven hackers.
However, at the same time it enabled the law enforcement agencies to gather
information about over one hundred other hackers, systems being discussed,
anything transmitted in electronic mail on the bulletin board, and most likely
gave them information about hundreds of other hackers, bulletin boards, and so
forth.

Many of you probably remember a system known as "THE BOARD" in the Detroit 313
NPA.  The number was 313-592-4143 and the newuser password was
"HEL-N555,ELITE,3" (then return).  It was kind of unique because it was run off
of an HP2000 computer.

On August 20, 1986 the following messages began to appear on THE BOARD;

Title:   YOU'VE BEEN HAD!!!
To:      ALL
From:    HIGH TECH
Posted:   8/20/86 @ 12.08 hours

Greetings:

You are now on THE BOARD, a "sting" BBS operated by MIKE WENDLAND of the
WDIV-TV I-Team.  The purpose?  To demonstrate and document the extent of
criminal and potentially illegal hacking and telephone fraud activity by the
so-called "hacking community."

Thanks for your cooperation.  In the past month and a half, we've received all
sorts of information from you implicating many of you to credit card fraud,
telephone billing fraud, vandalism, and possible break-ins to government or
public safety computers.  And the beauty of this is we have your posts, your
E-Mail and--- most importantly ---your REAL names and addresses.

What are we going to do with it?  Stay tuned to News 4.  I plan a special
series of reports about our experiences with THE BOARD, which saw users check
in from coast-to-coast and Canada, users ranging in age from 12 to 48.  For our
regular users, I have been known as High Tech, among other ID's.  John Maxfield
of Boardscan served as our consultant and provided the HP2000 that this "sting"
ran on.  Through call forwarding and other conveniences made possible by
telephone technology, the BBS operated remotely here in the Detroit area.

When will our reports be ready?  In a few weeks.  We now will be contacting
many of you directly, talking with law enforcement and security agents from
credit card companies and the telephone services.

It should be a hell of a series.  Thanks for your help.  And don't bother
trying any harassment.  Remember, we've got YOUR real names.

Mike Wendland

Title:   BOARDSCAN
To:      ALL
From:    THE REAPER

This is John Maxfield of Boardscan.  Welcome!  Please address all letter bombs
to Mike Wendland at WDIV-TV Detroit.  This board was his idea.

The Reaper (a.k.a. Cable Pair)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Maxfield was in general extremely proud of his efforts with THE BOARD and
he said that a lot of the people he voice verified should have known it was
him.  According to John Maxfield, the only reason this sting board was put up
was to show "What is currently happening in the phreak/hack community."   He
said no legal action will be taken at all, and besides, its fattened his
"dossiers" on a lot of people!

   [The news stories for WDIV-TV 4 appeared in Phrack World News Issue IX.]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Now, this is a classic example of people not learning from other people's
mistakes.  At some point in time prior to this incident, the number for THE
BOARD was posted, it was given a lot of hype and eventually it drew in hackers
to THE BOARD like flies to a spider web from which the unsuspecting users never
broke free.

That is the point I am trying to make -- today's phreak/hacker must learn to be
more security conscious.  What makes anyone think that they can trust someone
just because they are running a bulletin board?  This blind faith is what will
be the downfall of many a hacker until they wise up and start paying attention
to what they are doing.  Safety first; the stakes in this game are a lot higher
than no television after school for a week because once a hacker's phone number
falls into the wrong hands, the law enforcement community or organizations like
the Communications Fraud Control Association (CFCA) can find out everything
about you.  I know because I have seen their files and their hacker data base
is so incredibly large and accurate...its unbelievable.

Metalland South:  Phreak BBS or MetaliFEDS Inc.?                   June 2, 1987
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Metalland South BBS, at 404-327-2327, was once a fairly well known bulletin
board, where many respected members of the hack/phreak community resided.  It
was originally operated by two guys from Metal Communications, Inc., but it
wasn't an MCI club board.  The sysop was Iron Man and the co-sysop was Black
Lord.  Recently, it has come to the writer's attention, that MLS has come under
new management, new policies, and possibly a new idea; Sting.

Somewhere around September-October 1986, Iron Man removed all of the hack/
phreak related subboards as well as all G-philes from the system.  He was
apparently worried about getting busted.  The last time this reporter spoke
with him, Iron Man said he intended to put the hack/phreak subs back up.  Then,
not long after this conversation, the number was changed (The original number
was 404-576-5166).

A person using the alias of The Caretaker was made co-sysop and Iron Man would
not reply to feedback.  Everything was handled by The Caretaker [TC from now
on].  TC did not allow any hack/phreak subs, but said he would put them up if
the users would follow STRICT validation procedures.

Strict validation on MLS includes:

^*^  Your Real Name
^*^  Your Address
^*^  Your Voice Phone Number
^*^  A Self-Addressed Envelope (in which he will send back with your account
                                number and password.)

It is obvious to see the ramifications here.  A board or sysop gets busted and
then makes a deal to turn over the board to some company or agency.  To make
sure that they get who they want, you have to give them all this info, and the
only you can get a password is to let them mail it to you, thus guaranteeing
that if something illegal is posted under that account, you are responsible, no
ifs, ands, or buts.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

There was more information that went on to prove that Metalland South was
indeed some kind of a trap or sting board and the whole aura of mystery
surrounding this system made it not worth calling.

Do not EVER give a sysop your address so he can send you your password.  There
is no need for such information as it can only hurt you severely and would not
benefit the sysop in any way that would leave you unharmed.

One other item concerning bulletin boards comes from PWN Issue V where mention
of yet another hacker sting board named The Tunnel was discovered in Texas.
And lets not forget about TMC's P-80, sysoped by Scan Man, that was responsible
for the apprehension of Shawn of Phreakers Quest (also known as Capt. Caveman).

However, do not fool yourself into believing that bulletin boards are the only
places you are likely to run into trouble.  Regular systems that you like to
work with may be just as dangerous if you are not careful.  Druidic Death and
Celtic Phrost found this out the hard way on the Unix system at MIT as they
nearly succumbed to the power of progressive entrapment which would have doomed
them both.

MIT Unix:  Victim or Aggressor?                   January 23 - February 2, 1987

Was the MIT system an innocent victim of hacker oppression or simply another
trap to capture unsuspecting hackers in the act?

It all started like this...

Lately I've been messing around on MIT's VAX in there Physics Department.

Recently some one else got on there and did some damage to files.  However MIT
told me that they'll still trust us to call them.  The number is:

617-253-XXXX

We have to agree to the following or we will be kicked off, they will create a
"hacker" account for us.

<1>  Use only GUEST, RODNEY, and GAMES.  No other accounts until the hacker one
     is made.  There are no passwords on these accounts.
<2>  Make sure we log off properly.  Control-D.  This is a UNIX system.
<3>  Not to call between 9 AM and 5 PM Eastern Standard Time.  This is to avoid
     tying up the system.
<4>  Leave mail to GEORGE only with UNIX questions (or C).  And leave our
     handles so he'll know who we are.

Thanks Death for the MIT computer, I've been working on getting into them for
weeks.  Here's another you can play around with:

                           617/258-XXXX  login:GUEST

Or use a WHO command at the logon to see other accounts, it has been a long
time since I played with that system, so I am unsure if the GUEST account still
works, but if you use the WHO command you should see the GUEST account needed
for applying for your own account.

Ok people, MIT is pissed, someone hasn't been keeping the bargain and they
aren't too thrilled about it.  There were only three things they asked us to
do, and they were reasonable too.  All they wanted was for us to not compromise
the security much more than we had already, logoff properly, not leave any
processes going, and call only during non-business hours, and we would be able
to use the GUEST accounts as much as we like.

Someone got real nice and added themselves to the "daemon" group which is
superusers only, the name was "celtic".  Gee, I wonder who that could have
been?  I'm not pissed at anyone, but I'd like to keep on using MIT's computers,
and they'd love for us to be on, but they're getting paranoid.  Whoever is
calling besides me, be cool ok?  They even gave me a voice phone to chat with
their sysops with.  How often do you see this happen?

A little perturbed but not pissed...

Well, personally I don't know why anyone would want to be a superuser on the
system in question. Once you've been on once, there is really nothing that
interesting to look at...but anyway.

...I was framed!! I did not add myself to any "daemon" group on any MIT UNIX.
I did call once, and I must admit I did hang up without logging off, but this
was due to a faulty program that would NOT allow me to break out of it, no
matter what I tried.  I am sure that I didn't cause any damage by that.

Major Problems
Name: Druidic Death

OK, major stuff going down.  Some unidentified individual logged into the
Physics Dept's PDP11/34 at 617-253-XXXX and was drastically violating the
"agreement" we had reached.  I was the one that made the "deal" with them.  And
they even gave me a voice line to talk to them with.

Well, one day I called the other Physics computer, the office AT and discovered
that someone created an account in the superuser DAEMON group called "celtic".
Well, I was contacted by Brian through a chat and he told me to call him.  Then
he proceeded to nicely inform me that "due to unauthorized abuse of the system,
the deal is off".

He was cool about it and said he wished he didn't have to do that.  Then I
called George, the guy that made the deal and he said that someone who said he
was "Celtic Phrost" went on to the system and deleted nearly a year's worth of
artificial intelligence data from the nuclear fission research base.

Needless to say I was shocked.  I said that he can't believe that it was one of
us, that as far as I knew everyone was keeping the deal.  Then he (quite pissed
off) said that he wanted all of our names so he can report us to the FBI.  He
called us fags, and all sorts of stuff, he was VERY!! [underline twice] PISSED!
I don't blame him.  Actually I'm not blaming Celtic Phrost, it very easily
could have been a frame up.

But another thing is George thinks that Celtic Phrost and Druidic Death are one
and the same, in other words, he thinks that *I* stabbed him in the back.
Basically he just doesn't understand the way the hacker community operates.

Well, the deal is off, they plan to prosecute whoever they can catch.  Since
George is my best friend's brother I have not only lost a friend, but I'm
likely to see some legal problems soon.  Also, I can forget about doing my
graduate work at MIT.  Whoever did this damage to them, I hope you're happy.
You really messed things up real nice for a lot of people.

Celtic, I don't have any reason to believe you messed with them.  I also have
no reason to think you didn't.  I'm not making an accusation against you, but
WHOEVER did this, deserves to be shot as far as I'm concerned.  Until this data
was lost, they were on the verge of harnessing a laser-lithium produced form of
nuclear fission that would have been more efficient than using the standard
hydrogen.  Well, back to the drawing board now.

I realize that it's hard to believe that they would have data like this on this
system.  But they were quite stupid in many other areas too.  Leaving the
superuser account with no password??  Think about it.

It's also possible that they were exaggerating.  But regardless, damage seems
to have been done.

Heck! I dunno, but whoever it was, I think, should let himself (the s00per
K-rad elyte d00d he is) be known.

I wasn't on MIT, but it was pretty dumb of MIT to even let Hackers on.  I
wouldn't really worry though, they did let you on, and all you have to prove is
that you had no reason to do it.

I highly doubt that is was someone on this system.  Since this is an elite
board, I think all the users are pretty decent and know right and wrong things
to do.  Could be that one of the users on this system called another system and
gave it out!??

It seems to me, or, what I gathered, they felt that there were going to be
hackers on the system to begin with and that this way they could keep
themselves basically safe.

I doubt that it was Celtic Phrost, I don't think he'd be an asshole like that.
But I can't say.  When I posted, I was pretty pissed about the whole deal. I've
calmed down now.  Psychic Warlord said something to me voice the other day that
made me stop and think.  What if this was a set up right from the start?  I
mean, MIT won't give me specifics on just what supposedly happened, Celtic
Phrost denies everything, and the biggest part of it is what George said to me.

"We can forgive you for what you did to us if you'll promise to go straight and
never do this again and just tell us who all of your friends are that are on
the system".

I didn't pay much attention to that remark at first, now I'm beginning to
wonder...

I, of course, didn't narc on anyone.  (Who do I know??? hehe)

It wouldn't surprise me if it was some kind of setup, it's been done before.

The Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~
What more is there to say?  It definitely looks like there was a setup involved
and it probably was not the first time and probably will not be the last time
either.  So how can you protect yourself?

As far as the bulletin boards go.  There is an unwritten rule somewhere that
basically says that to be a good sysop, you first have to be a good user.  If
the sysop of some mystery board is not someone you have seen around for a long
time, then I would not call.  However, even if it is someone who has been
around, references from someone you feel you can trust is a necessity.  It all
boils down to the reliability of the information and the persons involved.

When dealing with systems like the MIT Unix, remember, if its too good to be
true then most likely there will be something that you are not being told.
Who in their right mind is going to give free accounts to an important system
with delicate information to a group of hackers?  Its crazy.

This file will hopefully serve as an informative fresh look at an old game.  To
me, even if the time I spent putting this article together helps out or saves
only one phreak/hacker, I feel my job has been done successfully.

Satellite communications systems employ microwave terminals on satellites and
ground to earth stations for highly reliable and high-capacity communications
circuits.  The communication satellites are positioned in geosynchronous orbits
about 22,000 miles above the earth.  Thus the rotation of the satellite matches
that of the earth, and the satellite appears motionless above earth stations.
Three equally spaces satellites are required to cover the entire world.

The satellite's microwave terminals receive signals from an earth station and
retransmit those signals on another frequency to another earth station.
Because of the long distances involved, the round-trip communications path
takes about a half second.  This is referred to as the propagation delay.  The
propagation delay on a regular terrestrial phone line is about 1 millisecond
(ms) per 100 miles.

Each microwave terminal on the satellite, designated as a repeater or
transponder, includes a receiver for uplink transmissions and a transmitter for
down-link transmissions.  Separate bands of frequencies for up-link and
down-link transmissions are designated in the 1.5-30 GHz frequency range (1.5
GHz is equal to 1,500,000,000 Hz, or 1.5 billion hertz).  Typical frequencies
for communications satellites are 4-6 GHz for INTELSAT 5 and 12-14 GHz for
Anik-B, a Canadian satellite.

Each satellite transponder typically has twelve 36-MHz channels which can be
used for voice, data, or television signals.  Early communications satellites
had some 12 to 20 transponders, and the later satellites have up to 27 or more
transponders.  INTELSAT 5, for example, has a total of 27 or more transponders
providing 24,500 data/voice channels, one transponder providing two 17.5-MHz TV
channels, and one SPADE transponder with 800 channels.  SPADE (Single carrier
per channel, Pulse code modulation, multiple Access, Demand assignment) is a
digital telephone service which reserves a pool of channels in the satellite
for use on a demand-assignment basis.  SPADE circuits can be activated on a
demand basis between different countries and used for long or short periods of
time as needed.

Propagation Delay:

The approximate quarter second one-way propagation delay in satellite
communications affects both voice telephone and data communications.  Users of
voice communications via satellite links face two objectionable
characteristics; delayed speech and return echoes.  Echo suppressors are
installed to reduce the return echoes to an acceptable level.  Data
communications operations face more serious problems caused by propagation
delay.  Line protocol and error detection/correction schemes are slowed down
dramatically by the quarter second of delay.  User response time requirements
can be difficult to meet because of these cumulative effects.

Satellite delay compensation units are available to ensure a connection and
afford better operation for the terrestrial communications terminal that were
never designed to deal with the propagation delay of communications satellites.
One delay compensation unit is required at each final destination.  The units
reformat the data into larger effective transmission blocks so that
retransmision requests are sent back less frequently.  This reduces the number
of line turnarounds, each of which requires about a quarter second to go from
or return to the destination terminal or computer.  One error detection and
correction method used, called GO-BACK-N, requires that all blocks of data held
in the transmitting buffer, back to the one with the error in it, must be
retransmitted.  A more efficient method is to retransmit only the block of data
with the error, but this requires more logic in the equipment at each end.

Link to Earth Stations:

Most users cannot afford a satellite earth station, so a land line is needed
for a connection to the nearest earth station (Which they tell me is 65,000 bps
for a leased line).  Because of the great distance the signal must travel in
space, the relatively short distance between the two users on earth becomes
insignificant and actually does not affect the operating cost.  It is generally
not economical.  This is particularly true of high-capacity or broadband
applications.  Even though operating costs are insensitive to distance,
satellite companies may still charge more for longer distances based on
terrestrial line competition.

Nonterrestrial Problems:

The nonterrestrial portion of satellite communications bypasses the problems
encountered with broken phone lines, etc., but it has its own unique set of
problems.  Since satellite communications employ high-frequency microwave
radio transmission, careful planning is required to avoid interference between
the satellite and other microwave systems.  Eclipses of the sun, and even the
moon, can cause trouble because they cut off the source of energy for the
satellite's solar batteries.  Backup batteries are used to resolve most of
these difficulties, but the problem that is the most severe is when the sun
gets directly behind the satellite and becomes a source of unacceptable noise.
This occurs 10 times a year for about 10 min each time.  In order to obtain
uninterrupted service, an earth station must have a second dish antenna a short
distance away or the single dish antenna must have access to another satellite.

Accessing the Satellite:

There are three methods by which multiple users (earth stations) can access the
satellite.  The first is frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), whereby the
total bandwidth is divided into separate frequency channels assigned to the
users.  Each user has a channel, which could remain idle if that user had no
traffic.  Time-division multiple access (TDMA) provides each user with a
particular time slot or multiple time slots.  Here the channels are shared, but
some time slots could be idle if a user has no traffic to offer.  With
code-division multiple access (CDMA) each user can utilize the full bandwidth
at any time by employing a unique code to identify the user's traffic.  There
are, of course, trade-offs among the three methods; they involve error rate,
block size, throughput, interference, and cost.

Advantages:

o     Satellite lines are exceptionally well suited for broadband applications
      such as voice, television, and picture-phone, and the quality of
      transmission is high.
o     Satellite lines are generally less expensive for all voice and data
      types of transmission, whether it be dial-up or a leased line that is not
      short.  This is particularly true of overseas transmissions, and there is
      no underwater cable to create maintenance problems.

Disadvantages:

o    The propagation delay of about a quarter second way requires the
     participants of a voice conversation so slightly delay their responses to
     make sure no more conversation is still on the way.  The propagation delay
     has more of a severe effect on the transmission of data, and the effect
     becomes more pronounced with high speeds, half duplex operation, smaller
     blocks of data, and polling.  Satellite delay units, front end processors,
     multiplexers, and other devices have been designed to get around these
     problems, but there is no solution to the half second lost in total
     response time for interactive applications.
o    Some of the modems currently in use today have not been designed to handle
     the long delay of the initial connection via satellite, and the result can
     be a lost connection.  This can be frustrating when the common carrier
     elects to use satellite lines for regular dial-up calls up to say, 55
     percent of all calls out of a particular city during the busy traffic
     periods.

Closing:

Satellite communications is a very interesting topic to study.  Perhaps even
the present/and future satellite and Ham radio "Hackers" will one day be
running a Bulletin Board off of a WESTSTAR satellite -- Who's to say there
isn't one now? (Devious Snicker)

Introduction To Network Management - Southwestern Bell Telephone Company
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Modern Telecommunications Networks, relying on direct customer input and common
and stored program controlled switching, are generally very reliable and have
provided the means to supply low cost telecommunication service to all who
desire it.  Because these networks are designed on the probability that all
customers do not require service simultaneously, they are engineered and
equipped to provide acceptable levels of service during normal traffic load
periods.  When customer demands or equipment malfunctions cause a deviation
from the engineered requirements or heavier than normal calling occurs, modern
networks can become congested and network throughput can be affected.

              Network Management provides a means to improve the
            performance of the network during these contingencies.

                            Purpose And Objectives
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Network Management Centers purpose is to provide the constant surveillance
and control activities necessary to maintain the network at its optimum level
of performance.  This includes the Bell Operating Company (BOC) Intra-Lata
Networks and Inter-Exchange Facilities and Circuits.

NMC's objective is to meet customer and market needs and expectations, and at
the same time, maximize revenues derived from the provision of network service.

While the NMC cannot guarantee a certain level of service to the customer, it
can ensure the most effective use of existing network capacity in all
situations.  This will result in:

     - More completed calls
     - Higher return on network capital investment
     - Better customer service
     - Protection of essential services such as 911, during abnormal network
       situations
     - Ensuring equal access
     - Assisting in national security and emergency preparedness

The NMC has the capability to alter or change the switching network on a near
real-time basis.  This is accomplished thru Network Control Actions in the
switching machines.  Control messages from the NMC are acted upon by the
switching machines to either expand capacity by utilizing idle equipment and
trunks or to restrict the network by denying access to traffic that has a poor
chance of completion, thereby freeing equipment and trunks for traffic that has
a good chance of completion.

                 Principles And Responsibilities Of Operations
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In accomplishing the purpose and objective of the NMC, decision on network
control actions are guided by standard principle applicable to switching
technology or network architecture.  All network management control actions are
generally based upon at least one of the standard principles.

Inhibit Switching Congestion
----------------------------
Large numbers of ineffective attempts in a switching machine due to traffic
overload or equipment malfunctions can exceed the engineered capacity of the
system.  If not controlled, this congestion can spread to other connected
switching systems.  Network management controls are available that remove
ineffective attempts to a congested machine, inhibiting switching congestion
and preventing its spread to adjacent switching systems.

Use All Available Trunks
------------------------
The switching network is sized and equipped to accommodate the average business
day calling requirements.  Focused overloads (storms, holidays, floods, and
civil disturbances) can often result in greatly increased calling patterns for
which the network is not designed.  This aberration can also be caused by
facility failures and switching system outages.  In these cases some trunk
groups are greatly overloaded while others may be virtually idle.  Network
management reroutes can be activated in many of these cases to use temporary
idle capacity in the network, thereby completing calls that would otherwise be
blocked.

Keep All Trunks Filled With Messages
------------------------------------
A message is a completed call.  Since the network is normally trunk limited, it
is important to optimize the ratio of messages (revenue) to non-messages (non
revenue producing) on any trunk group.  When unusual or abnormal conditions
occur in the network that cause increased short holding time calls (non-message
such as busy tone, reorder tone, recorded announcement, and high-and-dry - dead
air), the number of carried messages decreases because non-message traffic is
occupying a larger percentage of system capacity.  Network management controls
are designed to reduce non-message traffic and allow more calls to complete.
This results in higher customer satisfaction and increased revenue for the
industry.

Give Priority To Single-Link Connections
----------------------------------------
In networks designed to automatically alternate route calls, the most efficient
use of available trunking occurs when traffic loads are at (or below) normal
engineered values.  When the engineered traffic load is exceeded, more calls
alternate route and therefore are required to use more than one trunk in order
to complete a call.  During overload situations, the use of more than one trunk
to complete a call occurs more often and the possibility of a multilink call
blocking other call attempts is greatly increased.  Thus, in some cases, it
becomes necessary to use network management controls to limit alternate routing
in order to give first routed traffic a reasonable chance to complete more
calls on the network than would otherwise be completed.

The responsibility of the Network Management Center is far-reaching, affecting
many work groups and organizations both in Southwestern Bell Telephone Company,
other telephone companies, and the customers.

The NMC provides:

     - Real-time surveillance and control of the switching network
     - Identifying abnormal network situations
     - A centralized point for information to higher management, IC's,
       Independent Companies, and other BOC's.
     - A focal point for national security and emergency preparedness concerns

                            The System -- A Picture
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Network Management System consists of three major components:  The
switching network itself, the data gathering support system, and the
surveillance and control system (NMC).

The NMC is driven by customer actions in the switching network which are
recorded and displayed via the EADAS/NM (Engineering Administration Data
Acquisition System for Network Management).  Network management control actions
are directed from the CRT to the switching network via the same system.

                                    Summary
                                    ~~~~~~~
Network Management is the term used to describe a variety of activities
associated with improving network traffic flow and customer service when
abnormal conditions (unusual traffic patterns or equipment failures) may have
resulted in a congested inefficient network.  These activities include the
application of network controls when and where necessary and planning the means
by which the impact of network overloads can be minimized.

Network Management is based upon the use of near real-time trunk group and
switching system data and the ability to implement appropriate network controls
thru the use of EADAS/NM.

Network Management is concerned with completing as many calls as possible
within the Intra-Lata network and providing equal treatment for the traffic
flow to and from all inter-exchange carriers.

All examples in this message pertain to Illinois Bell Telephone Company, which
covers the Chicago metropolitan area, and quite a bit of the rest of Illinois.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

There are three types of phone numbers which do not appear in the printed and
publicly available directory;

     (1)  Too new to list
     (2)  Non-listed
     (3)  Non-published

The third category of numbers not in the phone book or available from the
Directory Assistance Bureau are non-published numbers.  Non-published numbers
are NOT available at the directory Assistance level.  Inquiries about same
which are input into a DA (Directory Assistance) terminal simply come up with a
message that "at the customer's request, the number is not listed in our
records; the number is non-published."

Well, who does keep non-pub records then?  The Business Office has no handy way
to retrieve them, since they depend on an actual phone number when they pull up
a record to discuss an account.  Once a service order is processed, the number
and associated name are no longer available to the average worker in the
central office.

There was for several years a small group known as the "NonPub Number Bureau"
which at the time was located in Hinsdale, Illinois.  Needless to say, the
phone number to the NonPub Number Bureau was itself non-published, and was only
available to specified employees at Illinois Bell who were deemed to have a
"need to know clearance."  Now with all the records being highly computerized,
the keepers of the Non-Pub phone numbers are themselves scattered around from
one phone office to another.

When there is some specific need for an employee at the phone company to
acquire the non-published number of a subscriber, then certain security
precautions kick into place.  Only a tiny percentage of telephone company
employees are deemed to have a "need to know clearance" in the first place;
among these would be the GCO's (Group Chief Operators), certain management
people in the central offices, certain people in the Treasury/Accounting
office, and of course, security representatives both from Illinois Bell and the
various long distance carriers, such as AT&T, US. Sprint, and MCI.

Let us have a hypothetical example for our correspondent; Your mother has taken
seriously ill, and is on her deathbed.  Your brother is unable to reach you to
notify you of this because you have a non-pub number.  When his request for the
number has been turned down by Directory Assistance, simply because they do not
have it, he asks to speak with a supervisor, and he explains the problem.  He
provides his own name and telephone number, and the supervisor states he will
be called back at a later time.  The supervisor does not question if in fact an
emergency exists, which is the only valid reason for breaking security.  The
supervisor may, if they are doing their job correctly, ask the inquirer point
blank, "Are you stating there is an emergency situation?"

Please bear in mind that the law in Illinois and in many other states says that
if a person claims that an emergency exists in order to influence the use (or
discontinuance of use) of the telephone when in fact there is no emergency is
guilty of a misdemeanor crime.  You say yes this is an emergency and I need to
contact my brother/sister/etc right away.  The supervisor will then talk to
his/her supervisor, who is generally of the rank of Chief Operator for that
particular facility.

The Chief Operator will call the NonPub people, will identify herself, and
*leave her own call back number*.  The NonPub people will call back to verify
the origin of the call, and only then will there be information given out
regards your brother's telephone number.  It helps if you know the *exact* way
the name appears in the records, and the *exact* address; if there is more than
one of that name with non-pub service, they may tell you they are unable to
figure out who it is you want.

The NonPub person will then call the subscriber with the non-published number
and explain to them what has occurred, "So and so has contacted one of our
operators and asked for assistance in reaching you.  The party states that it
is a family emergency which requires your immediate attention.  Would it be
alright if we give him/her your number, or would you prefer to call them back
yourself?"

Based on the answer given, the number is either relayed back to the Chief
Operator, or a message is relayed back saying the non-pub customer has been
notified.  If the customer says it is okay to pass his number, then the Chief
Operator will call you back, ask who YOU are, rather than saying WHO she wants,
and satisfied with your identification will give you the number you are seeking
or will advise you that your brother has been given the message by someone from
our office, and has said he will contact you.

Before the NonPub people will even talk to you, your 'call back number' has to
be on their list of approved numbers for that purpose.  A clerk in the Business
office cannot imitate a Chief Operator for example, simply because NonPub would
say that the number you are asking us to call back to is not on our list.
"Tell your supervisor what it is you are seeking and have them call us..."
Other emergency type requests for non-pub numbers would be a big fire at some
business place in the middle of the night, and the owners of the company must
be notified at their home; or a child is found wandering by the police and the
child is too young to know his parent's (non-pub) number.

They will also handle non-emergency requests, but only if they are of some
importance and not frivolous in nature.  You have just come to our city to
visit and are seeking a long lost friend who has a non-pub number; you are
compiling the invitations to your high school class fiftieth re-union and find
a class member is non-pub.  Within certain reasonable limits, they will pass
along your request to the desired party and let them make the choice of whether
to return the call or not.  But always, you leave your phone number with them,
and in due time someone will call you back to report what has been said or
done.

You would be surprised -- or maybe you wouldn't -- at the numerous scams and
stories people tell the phone company to get the non-pub numbers of someone
else.  Fortunately, Bell takes a great deal of pride in their efforts to
protect the privacy of their subscribers.

SUMMARY -- This file describes the "blocking" by one long-distance telephone
company of access through their system to certain telephone numbers,
particularly BBS numbers.  The blocking is applied in a very arbitrary manner,
and the company arrogantly asserts that BBS SYSOPS and anyone who uses a
computer modem are "hackers."

The company doesn't really want to discuss the situation, but it appears the
following scenario occurred.  The proverbial "person or persons unknown"
identified one or more "valid" long-distance account numbers, and subsequently
used those numbers on one or more occasions to fraudulently call a legitimate
computer bulletin board system (BBS).  When the long-distance company
discovered the fraudulent charges, they "blocked" the line without bothering to
investigate or contacting the BBS System Operator to obtain his assistance.  In
fact, the company did not even determine the sysop's name.

The long-distance carrier would like to pretend that the incident which
triggered the actions described in this article was an isolated situation, not
related to anything else in the world.  However, there are major principles of
free, uninhibited communications and individual rights deeply interwoven into
the issue.  And, there is still the lingering question, "If one long-distance
company is interfering with their customers' communications on little more than
a whim, are other long-distant companies also interfering with the American
public's right of free 'electronic speech'?"

CALL TO ACTION -- Your inputs and protests are needed now to counter the
long-distance company's claims that "no one was hurt by their blocking actions
because nobody complained."  Obviously nobody complained for a long time
because the line blocking was carried out in such a manner that no one
realized, until April 1988, what was being done.

Please read through the rest of this article and judge for yourself.  Then,
please write to the organizations listed at the end of the article; insist that
your right to telephone whatever number you choose should not be impaired by
the arbitrary decision of some telephone company bureaucrat who really doesn't
care about the rights of his customers.  Protest in the strongest terms.  And,
remember, the rights you save WILL BE YOUR OWN!

SETTING THE SCENE -- Teleconnect is a long-distance carrier and telephone
direct marketing company headquartered in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  The company is
about eight years old, and has a long-distance business base of approximately
200,000 customers.  Teleconnect has just completed its first public stock
offering, and is presently (August 1988) involved in a merger which will make
it the nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier.  It is a very rapidly
growing company, having achieved its spectacular growth by offering long
distance service at rates advertised as being 15% to 30% below AT&T's rates.

When Teleconnect started out in the telephone interconnection business,
few, if any, exchanges were set up for "equal access," so the company set up a
network of local access numbers (essentially just unlisted local PABXs -
Private Automatic Branch eXchanges) and assigned a six-digit account number to
each customer.  Later, a seventh "security" digit was added to all account
numbers.  Teleconnect now offers direct "equal access" dialing on most
exchanges, but the older access number/account code system is still in place
for those exchanges which do not offer "equal access."  That system is still
very useful for customers who place calls from their offices or other locations
away from home.

"BLOCKING" DISCOVERED -- In early April 1988, a friend mentioned that
Teleconnect was "blocking" certain telephone lines where they detected computer
tone.  In particular, he had been unable to call Curt Kyhl's Stock Exchange BBS
in Waterloo, Iowa.  This sounded like something I should certainly look into,
so I tried to call Curt's BBS.

CONTACT WITH TELECONNECT -- Teleconnect would not allow my call to go through.
Instead, I got a recorded voice message stating that the call was a local call
from my location.  A second attempt got the same recorded message.  At least,
they were consistent.

I called my Teleconnect service representative and asked just what the problem
was.  After I explained what happened, she suggested that it must be a local
call.  I explained that I really didn't think a 70 mile call from Cedar Rapids
to Waterloo was a local call.  She checked on the situation and informed me
that the line was being "blocked."  I asked why, and she "supposed it was at
the customer's request."  After being advised that statement made no sense, she
admitted she really didn't know why.  So, on to her supervisor.

The first level supervisor verified the line was being "blocked by Teleconnect
security," but she couldn't or wouldn't say why.  Then, she challenged, "Why do
you want to call that number?"  That was the wrong question to ask this unhappy
customer, and the lady quickly discovered that bit of information was none of
her business.  On to her supervisor...

The second level supervisor refused to reveal any information of value to
a mere customer, but she did suggest that any line Teleconnect was blocking
could still be reached through AT&T or Northwestern Bell by dialing 10288-1.
When questioned why Teleconnect, which for years had sold its long-distance
service on the basis of a cost-saving over AT&T rates, was now suggesting that
customers use AT&T, the lady had no answer.

I was then informed that, if I needed more information, I should contact
Dan Rogers, Teleconnect's Vice President for Customer Service.  That sounded
good; "Please connect me."  Then, "I'm sorry, but Mr. Rogers is out of town,
and won't be back until next week."  "Next week?"  "But he does call in
regularly.  Maybe he could call you back before that."  Mr. Rogers did call me
back, later that day, from Washington, D.C. where he and some Teleconnect
"security people" were attending a conference on telephone security.

TELECONNECT RESPONDS, A LITTLE -- Dan Rogers prefaced his conversation with,
"I'm just the mouthpiece; I don't understand all the technical details.  Our
security people are blocking that number because we've had some problems with
it in the past."  I protested that the allegation of "problems" didn't make
sense because the number was for a computer bulletin board system operated by a
reputable businessman, Curt Kyhl.

Mr. Rogers said that I had just given Teleconnect new information; they had not
been able to determine whose number they were blocking.  "Our people are good,
but they're not that good.  Northwestern Bell won't release subscriber
information to us."  And, when he got back to his office the following Monday,
he would have the security people check to see if the block could be removed.

The following Monday, another woman from Teleconnect called to inform me that
they had checked the line, and they were removing the block from it.  She added
the comment that this was the first time in four years that anyone had
requested that a line be unblocked.  I suggested that it probably wouldn't be
the last time.

In a later telephone conversation, Dan Rogers verified that the block had been
removed from Curt Kyhl's line, but warned that the line would be blocked
again "if there were any more problems with it."  A brief, non-conclusive
discussion of Teleconnect's right to take such action then ensued.  I added
that the fact that Teleconnect "security" had been unable to determine the
identity of the SYSOP of the blocked board just didn't make sense; that it
didn't sound as if the "security people" were very competent.  Mr. Rogers then
admitted that every time the security people tried to call the number, they
got a busy signal (and, although Mr. Rogers didn't admit it, they just "gave
up," and arbitrarily blocked the line).  Oh, yes, the lying voice message,
"This is a local call...," was not intended to deceive anyone according to Dan
Rogers.  It was just that Teleconnect could only put so many messages on their
equipment, and that was the one they selected for blocked lines.

BEGINNING THE PAPER TRAIL -- Obviously, Teleconnect was not going to pay much
attention to telephone calls from mere customers.  On April 22, Ben Blackstock,
practicing attorney and veteran sysop, wrote to Mr. Rogers urging
that Teleconnect permit their customers to call whatever numbers they desired.
Ben questioned Teleconnect's authority to block calls, and suggested that such
action had serious overlays of "big brother."  He also noted that "you cannot
punish the innocent to get at someone who is apparently causing Teleconnect
difficulty."

Casey D. Mahon, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Teleconnect,
replied to Ben Blackstock's letter on April 28th.  This response was the start
of Teleconnect's seemingly endless stream of vague, general allegations
regarding "hackers" and "computer billboards."  Teleconnect insisted they did
have authority to block access to telephone lines, and cited 18 USC
2511(2)(a)(i) as an example of the authority.  The Teleconnect position was
summed up in the letter:

    "Finally, please be advised the company is willing to 'unblock' the line in
    order to ascertain whether or not illegal hacking has ceased.  In the
    event, however, that theft of Teleconnect long distance services through
    use of the bulletin board resumes, we will certainly block access through
    the Teleconnect network again and use our authority under federal law to
    ascertain the identity of the hacker or hackers."

THE GAUNTLET IS PICKED UP -- Mr. Blackstock checked the cited section of the
U.S. Code, and discovered that it related only to "interception" of
communications, but had nothing to do with "blocking."  He advised me of his
opinion and also wrote back to Casey Mahon challenging her interpretation of
that section of federal law.

In his letter, Ben noted that, "Either Teleconnect is providing a communication
service that is not discriminatory, or it is not."  He added that he would
"become upset, to say the least" if he discovered that Teleconnect was blocking
access to his BBS.  Mr. Blackstock concluded by offering to cooperate with
Teleconnect in seeking a declaratory judgment regarding their "right" to block
a telephone number based upon the actions of some third party.  To date,
Teleconnect has not responded to that offer.

On May 13th, I sent my own reply to Casey Mahon, and answered the issues of her
letter point by point.  I noted that even I, not an attorney, knew the
difference between "interception" and "blocking", and if Teleconnect didn't,
they could check with any football fan.  My letter concluded:

    "Since Teleconnect's 'blocking' policies are ill-conceived, thoughtlessly
    arbitrary, anti-consumer, and of questionable legality, they need to be
    corrected immediately.  Please advise me how Teleconnect is revising these
    policies to ensure that I and all other legitimate subscribers will have
    uninhibited access to any and all long-distance numbers we choose to call."

Casey Mahon replied on June 3rd.  Not unexpectedly, she brushed aside all
my arguments.  She also presented the first of the sweeping generalizations,
with total avoidance of specifics, which we have since come to recognize as a
Teleconnect trademark.  One paragraph neatly sums Casey Mahon's letter:

    "While I appreciate the time and thought that obviously went into your
    letter, I do not agree with your conclusion that Teleconnect's efforts to
    prevent theft of its services are in any way inappropriate.  The
    inter-exchange industry has been plagued, throughout its history, by
    individuals who devote substantial ingenuity to the theft of long distance
    services.  It is not unheard of for an interexchange company to lose as
    much as $500,000 a month to theft.  As you can imagine, such losses, over a
    period of time, could drive a company out of business."

ESCALATION -- By this time it was very obvious that Teleconnect was going to
remain recalcitrant until some third party, preferably a regulatory agency,
convinced them of the error of their ways.  Accordingly, I assembled the file
and added a letter of complaint addressed to the Iowa Utilities Board.  The
complaint simply asked that Teleconnect be directed to institute appropriate
safeguards to ensure that "innocent third parties" would no longer be adversely
affected by Teleconnect's arbitrary "blocking" policies.

My letter of complaint was dated July 7, 1988 and the Iowa Utilities Board
replied on July 13, 1988.  The The reply stated that Teleconnect was required
to respond to my complaint by August 2, 1988, and the Board would then propose
a resolution.  If the proposed resolution was not satisfactory, I could request
that the file be reopened and the complaint be reconsidered.  If the results
of that action were not satisfactory, a formal hearing could be requested.

After filing the complaint, I also sent a copy of the file to Congressman Tom
Tauke.  Mr. Tauke represents the Second Congressional District of Iowa, which
includes Cedar Rapids, and is also a member of the House Telecommunications
Subcommittee.  I have subsequently had a personal conversation with Mr. Tauke
as well as additional correspondence on the subject.  He seems to have a deep
and genuine interest in the issue, but at my request, is simply an interested
observer at this time.  It is our hope that the Iowa Utilities Board will
propose an acceptable resolution without additional help.

AN UNRESPONSIVE RESPONSE -- Teleconnect's "response" to the Iowa Utilities
Board was filed July 29, 1988.  As anticipated, it was a mass of vague
generalities and unsubstantiated allegations.  However, it offered one item of
new, and shocking, information; Curt Kyhl's BBS had been blocked for ten
months, from June 6, 1987 to mid-April 1988.  (At this point it should be noted
that Teleconnect's customers had no idea that the company was blocking some of
our calls.  We just assumed that calls weren't going through because of
Teleconnect's technical problems).

Teleconnect avoided putting any specific, or even relevant, information in
their letter.  However, they did offer to whisper in the staff's ear;
"Teleconnect would be willing to share detailed information regarding this
specific case, and hacking in general, with the Board's staff, as it has in the
past with various federal and local law enforcement agencies, including the
United States Secret Service.  Teleconnect respectfully requests, however, that
the board agree to keep such information confidential, as to do otherwise would
involve public disclosure of ongoing investigations of criminal conduct and the
methods by which interexchange carriers, including Teleconnect, detect such
theft."

There is no indication of whether anyone felt that such a "confidential"
meeting would violate Iowa's Open Meetings Law.  Nobody apparently questioned
why, during a ten-months long "ongoing investigation," Teleconnect seemed
unable to determine the name of the individual whose line they were blocking.
Of course, whatever they did was justified because in their own words,
"Teleconnect had suffered substantial dollar losses as a result of the theft of
long distance services by means of computer 'hacking' utilizing the computer
billboard which is available at that number."

Teleconnect's most vile allegation was, "Many times, the hacker will enter the
stolen authorization code on computer billboards, allowing others to steal long
distance services by utilizing the code."  But no harm was done by the blocking
of the BBS number because, "During the ten month period the number was blocked,
Teleconnect received no complaints from anyone claiming to be the party to whom
the number was assigned."  The fact that Curt Kyhl had no way of knowing his
line was being blocked might have had something to do with the fact that he
didn't complain.

It was also pointed out that I really had no right to complain since, "First,
and foremost, Mr. Schmickley is not the subscriber to the number."  That is
true, I'm just a long-time Teleconnect customer who was refused service because
of an alleged act performed by an unknown third party.

Then Teleconnect dumped on the Utilities Board staff a copy of a seven page
article from Business Week Magazine, entitled "Is Your Computer Secure?"  This
article was totally unrelated to the theft of long-distance service, except for
an excerpt from a sidebar story about a West German hackers' club.  The story
reported that, "In 1984, Chaos uncovered a security hole in the videotex system
that the German telephone authority, the Deutsche Bundespost, was building.
When the agency ignored club warnings that messages in a customer's private
electronic mailbox weren't secure, Chaos members set out to prove the point.
They logged on to computers at Hamburger Sparkasse, a savings bank, and
programmed them to make thousands of videotex calls to Chaos headquarters on
one weekend.  After only two days of this, the bank owed the Bundespost $75,000
in telephone charges."

RESOLUTION WITH A RUBBER STAMP -- The staff of the Iowa Utilities Board replied
to my complaint by letter on August 19, 1988.  They apparently accepted the
vague innuendo submitted by Teleconnect without any verification; "Considering
the illegal actions reportedly to be taking place on number (319) 236-0834, it
appears the blocking was reasonable.  However, we believe the Board should be
notified shortly after the blocking and permission should be obtained to
continue the blocking for any period of time."

However, it was also noted that, "Iowa Code 476.20 (1) (1987) states, 'A
utility shall not, except in cases of emergency, discontinue, reduce, or impair
service to a community or a part of a community, except for nonpayment of
account or violation of rules and regulations, unless and until permission to
do so is obtained from the Board."  The letter further clarified, "Although the
Iowa Code is subject to interpretation, it appears to staff that 'emergency'
refers to a relatively short time..."

CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE -- Since it appeared obvious that the Utilities Board
staff had not questioned or investigated a single one of Teleconnect's
allegations, the staff's response was absolutely astounding.  Accordingly, I
filed a request for reconsideration on August 22nd.

Three points were raised in the request for reconsideration;

    (1) The staff's evaluation should have been focused on the denial of
        service to me and countless others of Teleconnect's 200,000 customers,
        and not just on the blocking of incoming calls to one BBS.

    (2) The staff accepted all of Teleconnect's allegations as fact, although
        not one bit of hard evidence was presented in support of those
        allegations.

    (3) In the words of the staff's own citation, it appeared that Teleconnect
        had violated Iowa Code 476.20 (1) (1987) continuously over a ten
        months' period, perhaps as long as four years.

Since Teleconnect had dumped a seven page irrelevant magazine article on the
staff, it seemed only fair to now offer a two page completely relevant story to
them.  This was "On Your Computer - Bulletin Boards," from the June 1988 issue
of "Changing Times."  This excellent article cited nine BBSs as "good places to
get started."  Among the nine listed BBSs was Curt Kyhl's "Stock Exchange,
Waterloo, Iowa (319-236-0834)."  Even the geniuses at Teleconnect ought to be
able to recognize that this BBS, recommended by a national magazine, is the
very same one they blocked for ten months.

MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH -- You are now up-to-date on the entire story.
Now, we are in the process of spreading the word so that all interested people
can contact the Iowa authorities so they will get the message that this case is
much bigger than the blocking of one BBS.  YOU can help.

Read the notice appended to this file and ACT.  If you are a Teleconnect
customer, it is very important that you write the agencies listed on the
notice.  If you are not a Teleconnect customer, but are interested in
preserving your rights to uninhibited communications, you can help the cause by
writing to those agencies, also.  Please, people, write now!  Before it is too
late!

         If you are user of Teleconnect's long distance telephone service, you
need to be aware of their "blocking" policy:

    Teleconnect has been "lashing out" against the callers of bulletin boards
    and other "computer numbers" by blocking access of legitimate subscribers
    to certain phone numbers to which calls have been made with fraudulent
    Teleconnect charge numbers.  Curt Kyhl's Stock Exchange Bulletin Board in
    Waterloo has been "blocked" in such a manner.  Teleconnect representatives
    have indicated that other "computer numbers" have been the objects of
    similar action in the past, and that they (Teleconnect) have a "right" to
    continue such action in the future.

    Aside from the trampling of individual rights guaranteed by the Bill of
    Rights of the U.S. Constitution, this arbitrary action serves only to
    "punish the innocent" Teleconnect customers and bulletin board operators,
    while doing absolutely nothing to identify, punish, or obtain payment from
    the guilty.  The capping irony is that Teleconnect, which advertises as
    offering significant savings over AT&T long-distance rates, now suggests to
    complaining customers that the blocked number can still be dialed through
    AT&T.

    Please write to Teleconnect.  Explain how long you have been a customer,
    that your modem generates a significant amount of the revenue they collect
    from you, and that you strongly object to their arbitrarily deciding what
    numbers you may or may not call.  Challenge their "right" to institute a
    "blocking" policy and insist that the policy be changed.  Send your
    protests to:
                     Teleconnect Company
                     Mr. Dan Rogers, Vice President for Customer Service
                     500 Second Avenue, S.E.
                     Cedar Rapids, Iowa  52401

    A complaint filed with the Iowa Utilities Board has been initially resolved
    in favor of Teleconnect.  A request for reconsideration has been filed, and
    the time is NOW for YOU to write letters to the State of Iowa.  Please
    write NOW to:
                     Mr. Gerald W. Winter, Supervisor, Consumer Services
                     Iowa State Utilities Board
                     Lucas State Office Building
                     Des Moines, Iowa  50319
         And to:
                     Mr. James Maret
                     Office of the Consumer Advocate
                     Lucas State Office Building
                     Des Moines, Iowa  50319

              Write now.  The rights you save WILL be your own.

After filing a request for reconsideration of my complaint, I received a reply
from the Iowa State Utilities Board which said, in part:

    "Thank you for your letter dated August 22, 1988, with additional comments
    concerning your complaint on the blocking of access to certain telephone
    numbers by Teleconnect.

    "To ensure that the issues are properly investigated, we are forwarding
    your comments to the company and requesting a response by September 15,
    1988."

Again, this is a very large issue.  Simply stated; Does ANY telephone company
have the right to "block" (or refuse to place) calls to ANY number on the basis
of unsubstantiated, uninvestigated charges of "telephone fraud," especially
when the alleged fraud was committed by a third party without the knowledge of
the called party?  In the specific case, the question becomes; Can a long
distance carrier refuse to handle calls to a BBS solely because some unknown
crook has placed fraudulently-charged calls to that BBS?  Incidentally, when
you write, please cite file number C-88-161.

If you have any additional information which might be helpful in this
battle, please let me know.

You can send mail to me via U.S. Mail to:  Jim Schmickley
                                           7441 Commune Court, N.E.
                                           Cedar Rapids, Iowa  52402

                         Transcribed by Hatchet Molly


Hello.  In this special presentation of Phrack World News, we have the abridged
transcripts from the Ed Schwartz Show, a late night talk show broadcast by
WGN Radio 720 AM - Chicago, Illinois.

The transcripts that appear here in Phrack have been edited for this
presentation.  For the most part, I have decided to omit the unrelated chatter
as well as any comments or discussions that are not pertinent to the intent of
Phrack World News.  In addition to this, I have also edited the speech somewhat
to make it more intelligible, not an easy task.  However, the complete unedited
version of this broadcast can be found on The Phoenix Project (512)441-3088,
sysoped by The Mentor.

                                      ^*^

ES: It's 12 minutes after the hour.  The hour, of course, is eleven o'clock. We
    have a tremendous amount of commerce that goes on late at night and in the
    early morning.  When I say commerce I'm talking about computer operations
    of all kind from keypunching to tabulating - you name it.

    We've done two programs with Ed Zahdi who is the researcher from THE READER
    (the weekly newspaper) from the "straight dope" column.  Ed Zahdi does the
    research and on two appearances (on two Friday nights) within the last year
    or so on this program Ed Zahdi has received a number of phone calls...
    about computer hacking, about people whose telephones mysteriously ring in
    the middle of the night -- or almost any time of the day but constantly do
    so and they pick up the phone and there's nobody there.

    The last time Ed Zahdi was on, we were flooded with calls from people who
    claimed that;

    o  There are all kinds of telemarketing people who are ringing telephones.
    o  That the phone company is testing phones and you don't know it.
    o  That the phone network gets tested every day and everybody's phone rings
       once or for half a ring and nobody's ever there.

    I was amazed at the number and type of calls that came in. We called the
    phone company and we asked for some cooperation and tonight we are having
    as guests not only Mr. Ed Zahdi from THE READER, but also Mr. Chuck Moran,
    the Director of Internal Affairs from Ameritech Applied Technologies.  We
    also have Mr. Bob Gates, Manager of Corporate Security for Ameritech.

    We're gonna get into this whole thing as to whether or not people are using
    and abusing the phone networks.  Whether or not computer hackers are
    ferreting out phone numbers with computers.  Whether or not you can really
    program a computer to randomly ring every telephone in the city or not.

    If you're a computer person hang around.  We're also going to talk about
    some of the things that the phone company and other allied businesses are
    doing to catch up with the computer hackers.
JC: Well, that sounds interesting to me.
ES: Well now are you ready for this?  The Bureau of Criminal Investigation of
    the Illinois State Police has a computer fraud unit.
JC: Uh-huh
ES: And do you know what they like to do?
JC: What do they like to do?
ES: Lock up computer hackers.  Tonight we're going have the computer hackers
    running for the hills!  Well maybe I should say "typing for the hills" huh?
JC: Probably! (chuckle)
ES: Because they don't run...most of them are couch potatoes.
JC: That's right!
ES: Glad to see you here Ed.
EZ: Glad to be here Ed.  In In the "straight dope" we deal with all kinds of
    questions one of the questions we got onto was the question of ghost
    rings.  People would hear these things primarily at night.
ES: On their home phone?
EZ: On their home phone.  What would happen is that they'd be sitting at home
    and the telephone would ring for a half a ring or a whole ring or maybe
    even two rings.  They would pick it up and nobody would be there.  And I'd
    heard about this in the past.  I thought it was some peculiarity of buying
    a phone from K-Mart or who knows where.

    We got easily a dozen calls in the course of the evening from people who
    had the same experience happen to them.  And it would always, oddly
    enough, happen at the same time of the night or on the same day of the
    week at the same time of the night and it was pretty eerie.

    We got one woman, who I've spoken to several times since who said that she
    was an answering service operator and she had whole banks of phones and
    sets of these phones would jingle once at a certain time of the night and
    then the next day a different set would jingle at a certain time of the
    night and then the following week or the following whenever the pattern
    would repeat, but nobody was ever there.  And so we decided there had to be
    some obvious solution to this problem and the speculation at the time was
    that it was some sort of a testing program that the phone company had to
    check out the trunk lines or something like that.

    So, I called up the phone company, Illinois Bell, I called up CenTel,
    called up Bell Labs, called up places like that to ask if they knew
    anything about it.  I asked whether there was a testing program, if not
    what explanation could they offer.  They said no, there was no testing
    program, they had no idea.  They had some speculation they thought
    conceivably some sort of computer ringing service was involved, but they
    didn't have any really clear idea so we came back here a couple of months
    ago to talk about it again.
ES: We were swamped with calls again.
EZ: I asked for the woman, whose name is Pat, who was the answering service
    operator to give me a call.  She did and she volunteered to help us out
    and see if we could use her phone system as a guinea pig and have the
    telephone company try and find out, if they had means of doing this, what
    the source of these ghost rings was.  One of the things she pointed out
    was that during the Hinsdale fire or during the time that the Hinsdale
    switching system was out of operation after the fire there the ghost rings
    stopped.
ES: Ahhhh!
EZ: After it was repaired the rings started up again, but they were on a more
    irregular basis whereas before they were sort of like clockwork at a given
    time of the night.
ES: Uh humm.
EZ: Now the same sets of phones would ring on a given day, but at predictable
    times.  And it would vary within an hour or so.  So what I hoped to do at
    that point was to get together with Pat and try and get together with the
    phone company at her place and see what we could find out.  Unfortunately
    she got sick, had a bad infection, so she was out of work for a long time.
ES: Uh humm.
EZ: She has just recently gotten back on the job and I spoke her today and our
    plan now is that I'll go over to her place of business on Thursday just to
    see for myself and at that point I'm going to call up probably your friend
    Ken Went at Illinois Bell.
ES: Head of Security
EZ: We'll see what we can find out and see if they'll do it for cheap 'cuz we
    haven't got a whole lot of resources yet.  Now the problem is that the
    connection only lasts for a split second and I hope that they can find
    something out in that short of a period of time in terms of tracing but
    its not clear to me that its totally possible.
ES: Now one of the things that we found out when you were here a few
    weeks ago on a Friday night was another element to all of this.
    Telemarketers have been known to, in terms of getting a hold of people,
    ring phones of people whose numbers they don't know.
EZ: We got some real interesting things.  There were two basic theories here
    that I guess that I should talk about.  One is that computer hackers do
    this.  One of the things that computer hackers do is program their
    computers to use their modems their modems to find other computers.  When
    they find one, there will be a characteristic tone that will tell the
    computer on the other end that its reached another computer.  If they
    don't find a computer they can disconnect real quickly before the
    connection is actually made and the charge is placed to their bills.  So
    they can do this all for free basically.  They'll do this routinely to
    try and find new locations of computers.
ES: Right.
EZ: So that was one theory.  The drawback to that theory is well, why would
    they do this repeatedly with a given number?  Because obviously if the
    computer isn't there Tuesday its not going to be there Friday afternoon.
    Why would they try this repeatedly every week.  That was one problem.  The
    second theory that was presented to us was that telemarketing firms do
    this to keep their files up to date.  They want to find out if given
    numbers are still in use or something along those lines.
ES: Cause people do move and people do change their phone numbers.
EZ: Right, so what they do is they dial a number up real quick and hang up
    before you can answer it.  At least they can detect whether the line is
    actually in use.  This gives them apparently some useful information.  So
    these were the two main theories and there were several elaborations on
    these that we'll probably hear more about tonight, but those were the
    theories that we had. he problem of course as I say is its not clear
    exactly what the advantage of doing this on a routine basis, weekly or
    whenever would be to the person who is doing it.
ES: There there are some very important elements to all of this.  First of all
    there was a guy on yesterday morning who apparently filed some lawsuits
    against companies that do telemarketing for disturbing him and he is going
    to set a precedent that if you are bothered at home by telemarketers that
    you can sue them and collect damages.

    Not often a lot of money but enough to make them uhh sit up and take
    notice and he is trying to teach other people how to sue telemarketing
    people.

              (Break for commercial followed by re-introductions)

CM: Thank you, Ed. It is our pleasure to be here.
ES: It's a pleasure to have you here.  Ameritech Applied Technologies is a
    division of Ameritech the phone company, right?
CM: Right. We're a subsidiary of Ameritech that that deals with information
    technology needs of the Ameritech family which includes Illinois Bell.
ES: What are some of the things you work on or are responsible for?
CM: I'm responsible for computer security for the Ameritech companies. I also
    happen to have auditing for Ameritech Applied Technologies, physical
    security for our company.  That kind of stuff.
ES: Big job!
CM: Yes.  We are involved with hackers regularly all the time.
ES: Good to have you here tonight Chuck.  Also I would like to introduce Mr.
    Bob Gates, manager of Corporate Security also with Ameritech Applied
    Technologies.
BG: Good Morning.
ES: And a good morning to you.  Bob previously was a police officer.  You have
    been in Corporate Security at Ameritech for how long now Bob?
BG: Since divestiture which was in January 1984.  Its a much more specialized
    field and you deal with one particular aspect of the whole scenario.
ES: Is it correct, are our callers correct?  Do you ring people's phones at
    various hours of the day and night?  Are there "ghost" rings?  Are there
    people out there playing around?  Is it the phone company or is it others?
    What's going on?
CM: Well, I've been in this telephone business for 22 years now.
ES  Okay now this is the Director of Internal Affairs for Ameritech Applied
    Technologies, Mr. Moran, go ahead.
CM: In my days at Illinois Bell, we very often heard these complaints.  We
    kept trying to find out what it was some of the things the we've
    discovered is the computer hackers!  They love to scan a prefix and look
    for a computer tone. They want a computer to talk to, so it'll ring a
    phone.  Their computer will ring your phone.
ES: Now this can be done from the bedroom of a thirteen year of a computer
    phreak right?  Or anybody else for that matter.
CM: If he has got a semi-good computer mind he can do it while he is asleep.
    He can program his PC to use his modem to dial your number.
ES: Is most of the computer hacking and unauthorized use of computers done in
    the off hours?  In other words its not people in business during the day,
    right?  Would that be basically your computer hacker description?
CM: People still have to live, they still have to have jobs to feed themselves,
    and they still have to go to school or go to classes and so your going to
    find that since hacking is a hobby, it is going to done during their free
    time.  Which is typically evenings, weekends, and vacation periods.
ES: I guess what I'm getting at here is I'm trying to establish most of the the
    computer related misbehavior comes more from private homes than from
    business offices.
CM: No. The studies seem to indicate that 80% of computer abusers are in fact
    people in business and are abusing their own company, but that is not going
    to cause your phone to ring.  The people who are using the network to call
    and look for computers are the people which we typically call hackers,
    which amount for 15-25% of the computer abuse that goes on in the world.
ES: How concerned is Ameritech and the other technology and phone
    companies around the country about all of this?
CM: Well just as any business Ameritech is highly dependent upon information
    systems to survive.  So we are concerned with whatever risks go with
    computer usage.
ES: Did you both see the film WarGames with Matthew Broderick?
CM and BG: Yeah.
ES: Now while the plot is pretty far-out, the theory is workable, correct?
BG: The natural inquisitiveness of the youthful mind, the need to explore.
ES: We've heard stories about computer hackers who have gotten into computers
    in government offices, high schools, colleges, and universities.  They've
    changed grades, added and subtracted information from formulas, and done
    all kinds of things.

    Payroll records have been changed and we've got a thing now called the
    computer virus.  We've got a conviction of a guy who is going to jail for
    literally destroying a computer program two days after he left the company
    and apparently that is something that computer people are very worried
    about.

    Are we going to end up with a huge number of people called "computer
    police" here at some point?  To get a handle on all of this, is that what
    we need?
BG: I think computer security is just a natural extension of using your
    computers to ensure that they are used in a secure manner.  That they
    aren't tampered with and they aren't abused.  To do that you have to take
    some degree of effort to protect your computer system.
ES: Is law enforcement geared up to deal with the kinds of crimes that you guys
    are working on, investigating and trying to deal with?
BG: Law enforcement does have experts with them.  They also have to investigate
    everything else that occurs.  So it becomes a priority item to private
    companies to make a commitment to look at it themselves to protect their
    systems and include law enforcement if appropriate.
ES: Is there a naivety on the part of a lot of people that just left computer
    systems unguarded.
BG: Yes.  In reference to the law enforcement, in our current criminal justice
    system I know that in the states that we deal with and the federal agencies
    that I have dealt with part of the problem is finding a prosecutor, a
    judge, and a jury that understands what a computer crime is,  Because they
    are not computer literate.
ES: Well stealing information and stealing time are crimes.  How about the
    stories of computer hackers breaking into computers at nuclear laboratories
    like Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California.  This is where they do
    the research on nuclear weapons and God knows what else.  Think of the
    potential of this kind of misbehavior it's frightening.
BG: That's why computer security has become a hot job.
EZ: I'm still trying to focus on my immediate problem here which was the
    question of the ghost rings.  What I'm hearing you say is that you think
    that the ghost rings are primarily the work of hackers.
CM: I think its a very plausible cause.
EZ: The question that people raise about this of course is that you can see it
    happening once in a while, but why all the time on a regular basis?
CM: The computer hacker scans prefixes and will set his dialer look for
    computer tones.  He may find a few numbers and tell two or three friends.
    Those two or three friends will now tell two or three other friends.  They
    will see these numbers and then they will go and scan that whole thousand
    number group again.
EZ: I still don't quite see why the ghost rings occur at exactly the same time
    all of the time.
CM: I can't answer that.
ES: I respond to that by saying the times are most likely approximate.  Most
    people's watches aren't perfect and neither are their memories.  However
    if the majority of the hackers are in high school, then they are probably
    going to sleep at about the same time every night and setting their dialers
    to run while they are asleep, therefore hitting the same numbers at roughly
    the same time every night.

    Is it correct to say that they can program these computers to do this work
    without any billing information being generated?  And how can they do this?
    Or is that an area we should stay away from,  I don't want to compromise
    you guys.
BG: You're talking toll fraud and that's really not my area of expertise.  Toll
    fraud is a fact of life, but I'm not a toll fraud person.
CM: The presumption is that the billing doesn't kick in for a split second
    after the phone is picked up and that is what enables these guys to get
    away with this.
BG: Talk to Ken.
ES: Ken will tell you things that you'll never be able to talk about on the
    radio or write about I'm afraid.  We're going to get into some other
    elements of all of this.  Are the penalties for computer hackers set to
    meet the crime these days? I mean do we catch many of them do they get
    punished and does the punishment fit the crime?
CM: The computer hackers that usually get caught are juveniles, which means the
    most you can do is keep them in jail until they are 21 and confiscate their
    computer equipment.  The U.S. Attorneys Office in the Northern District for
    Illinois did in fact return a juvenile indictment against a hacker who used
    the code name SHADOW HAWK.  It made the front page of the Chicago Tribune.
ES: What did he do?  Can you tell us?
CM: According to the Tribune, he stole software from AT&T.
ES: This proves that as smart as some of these hackers are, some of them get
    caught, maybe even a lot of them get caught.  So as hard as they're working
    to defy the system apparently you people are working from inside the system
    to foil what they are doing and catch them.
CM: Exactly
ES: If you don't prosecute them when you catch then then it will not mean a
    thing so does that mean that the various phone companies and their
    subsidiaries have got a very serious mood about prosecuting if you catch
    people?  Is that the way of the future?
CM: Every case is different.  Prosecution is always an option.
ES: Are we a couple of years late in dealing with this problem?
BG: The laws typically catch up to the need.  You have to identify a problem
    before you can really address it.
ES: We have made arrangements thanks to our guests tonight to speak to an
    Illinois State police detective sergeant who works on computer fraud;
    Sergeant Abagail Abraham.
AA: Good morning I appreciate being here.
ES: Have you been listening to the radio prior to our call?
AA: I've been glued to the radio yes.
ES: Okay.  Your unit is called Computer Crime Section?
AA: Sure.
ES: How long have you been in existence?
AA: Since February 1986.
ES: There obviously was a need for it.  Do we have enough state laws or state
    statutes for you to do what you have to do?
AA: I think so.  At the time that the section came into existence, the laws
    were not very good.  Most computer crimes were misdemeanors until a few
    months later when the attorney general held hearings in which we
    participated and thus they drafted a law.

ES: Sergeant, is it handled better at the state level as opposed to the federal
    level?  The gentlemen here from Ameritech mentions that the US Attorneys
    Office has recently brought a prosecution here in Northern Illinois.  Is
    his office going to be doing much more of this or do you see it being done
    at a state level?
AA: I think it depends upon the kind of case.  Certain cases are probably
    better handled at the federal level and certain cases are handled best at
    the local.  When dealing with the federal agencies, the jurisdiction for
    computer fraud is shared between the FBI and the Secret Service.  So it
    depends upon the nature of the case as to which agency would take it, but
    many cases are not appropriate for the federal government to take part in.
ES: Let's say we have a student who changes a grade in a school computer
    system.  That would be more a state case I would presume than a federal
    case right?
AA: Certainly it would be likely to be a state case, we had a case like that.
ES: If you were able to develop a case like that and have evidence, are you
    liable to get a conviction?  Our guests were saying that the courts don't
    necessarily understand all of this.  When you go into state court on this
    kind of a thing are you getting judges and/or juries who understand what
    you're talking about?
AA: Well we have had no cases go to jury trials.  As a matter of fact, no cases
    have even gone to bench trials because as like the vast majority of cases
    in the system they are plead out.
ES: They plead guilty?
AA: We have a 100% conviction rate.
ES: Really!
AA: Our success is based very good cooperation from state's attorneys offices.
    We've had no problems bringing our cases to them.
ES: Your data is so good that by the time you make your pinch there is no way
    they can talk their way out of it.  You've got them dead to rights.
AA: Yeah, we haven't had a problem with that.
ES: What kind of penalties are you getting Sarg?
AA: All of our cases have had a 100% conviction rate, be we haven't had that
    many finally adjudicated.  They are in various stages because the law is so
    new.
ES: I presume that you're going to continue working very hard put more people
    in jail.
AA: Yes, it's a growth industry.
ES: Is Director Margolis supportive of what you are doing?
AA: I think so.  Our unit came into existence under the prior director, Zegal,
    but Director Margolis has been very supportive of our efforts and I suspect
    that he will become even more so.
ES: Do people who are victims of computer crime know who to report it to? If
    you operate a business and your computer has been violated or anything at
    all has been done to you, does the average computer owner know who to
    report it to?
AA: No.  That's a really easy question!
BG: I would, but only because I'm in the industry.  However, the average small
    business man would probably be somewhat at a loss.
AA: He might not even realize that is is a crime.
BG: That's exactly true and fortunately Illinois has had the foresight to put
    together a unit such as the Sergeant's.
ES: Let's say there is a medium size company that uses computers.  I'll invent
    a company.  My name is Mr. X and I own a a fairly nice real estate company
    in the neighborhood of Chicago.  I've got maybe a dozen employees and a
    couple of years ago we went to computers to keep track of our listings, and
    all of our accounting and our bookkeeping, our past customers, and all our
    contactees.  I mean we've got a lot of data.  We communicate with some
    other real estate agencies and so we use modems, telephone lines and let
    computers talk to computers.  Since some of this work is done when our
    office is closed, we leave our system hooked up.  I came in yesterday
    morning and low-and-behold somebody got into our computer and erased all of
    our data, or part of it, or changed something.  I am the victim of a crime
    should I pick up the phone and call the Illinois State Police
AA: Sure.
ES: You'll show up and you'll investigate?
AA: Sure.
ES: Okay.
AA: There are several ways in which a case can get to us.  One of them is that
    you as the victim could contact us directly and another way would be to
    contact the local police and hope that they would call us.
ES: There's the key word...hope.  Does the Chicago Police, the Wilmette
    police, the Joliet police, do they know enough to refer these cases to you?
AA: I don't know if Joliet does, but Chicago and Wilmette certainly do.  For
    any of the police that are out there listening at this point let me add
    that if we were to get a case referred to us, we will handle the case in
    any one of a number of ways.  If the local agency brings it to us and wants
    nothing to do with the case because they have too much on their own we will
    take the case over.  If they would just like to either work cooperatively
    or have us go with them on an interview or two to translate what the victim
    may be saying we'd be happy to do that too.  So we have enough work to do
    now that we need not take cases over.  We are happy to work with any
    agency.
CM: I think one thing worth pointing out here is that we're focusing on on a
    crime via telephone.  Computer crime is done from afar where the victim
    doesn't know the offender.
AA: That's true.
CM: The majority of cases probably don't involve telephones at all.  They
    involve companies' own employees who are committing what amounts to
    embezzlement using computers.  Either transferring money by computer to
    their own accounts or somehow playing with the books and the employer might
    not realize for a long time until some auditing process occurs that the
    crime has even occurred.
AA: You're right.  There are a number of cases like that.  What happens very
    often in a case like that when it is somebody in-house is that the company
    will choose to not call it to the attention of the police they will choose
    instead to take disciplinary action or fire the person.  Their argument
    most times is that they don't want the embarrassment. We do not go out and
    seek headlines unless our victim is interested in having headline sought.
    We don't choose to publicize cases and embarrass our victim.  The stuff is
    simply not reported that much.
EZ: I was talking to a computer consultant once who said that the higher you
    are up in the company if you're involved with something like this the less
    likelihood there is of not only you never doing time, but even getting any
    sort of penalty involved.  I was there was one particular case of a guy who
    was an executive vice president for a bank who I think stole some
    phenomenal amount of money was in the millions who was discovered after
    some period of time and they didn't want it to get out that one their
    trusted employees was a crook so they gave threw this guy a retirement
    banquet
ES: Hahahahahaha.
EZ: They retired him from the company and he left with honors.
AA: I like this....
EZ: The consultant said he was there and it was the most hypocritical thing he
    ever saw, but they will do it to avoid the unfavorable publicity.
ES: I believe it.
AA: Certainly if you are high in the organization and you control things then
    you can control various procedures so that you are less likely to be caught
    and you are probably in control of enough money that you are able to come
    up with creative ways to embezzle it with less suspicion aroused.  I'm not
    sure why, but the more money you take the less likely you are to get
    prosecuted.
ES: People admire these kinds of crime.

           (Commercial Break and then reintroductions including...)

ES: I want to welcome a new player to our game tonight, Mr. John Maxfield.
    John Maxfield owns a corporate security consulting company.  John...are you
    there?
JM: Yes I am, good morning.
ES: Good morning I guess you are outside of Chicago and are you close enough to
    have been listening to our program?
JM: Well ahhhhh, unfortunately ahhhh I'm ahhh a bit to the east of you and I
    had a little trouble listening in on the radio so uhhh I've been listening
    the last few minutes on the telephone.
ES: We've gotten into all kinds of data here.  Have you and the sergeant ever
    talked before?
JM: I don't believe so.  I may have talked to somebody in the Illinois State
    Police ummmm maybe a year or so ago, but it was not the sergeant.
ES: Sergeant Abraham you're still there, correct?
AA: Yes.  I'm here
ES: I presume John that you know Chuck Moran and Bob Gates.
JM: Yes I ahhh am acquainted with ah Bob Gates.
ES: What does a private computer security company do?
JM: Well uhhh we get involved with ahhhhhh ahhhhh the cases that perhaps don't
    make the headlines.  Ummmmm and my role is more of kind of in counseling
    clients as to how they should secure their systems and to acquaint them
    with the risks and the kind of the nature of the enemy what they are up
    against.
ES: We were talking earlier about a movie called WarGames which I'm sure you
    must be familiar with.  My guests have been telling us a little bit about
    some of the things that go on. I suspect that the computer hacking problem
    and related behaviors is probably very severe isn't it?
JM: Yes ahhh it certainly is a growing problem  The movie WarGames kind of put
    out into the public eye what had been going on very quietly behind the
    scenes for a number of years.  And uhhh of course as a result of WarGames I
    think there was an increase in hacking activity because now a lot of the
    uhhh hackers suddenly realized that it was something that maybe something
    they should do and achieve notoriety.
ES: I have a question here that may or may not have an answer.  Why is that the
    legitimate use of the computer isn't enough to satisfy its user or owner.
    In other words, why hack?  Why misbehave?  Why break the law?  Why cost
    people a fortune?  I mean there are so many fascinating things you can do
    with a computer without breaking the law why are so many people into this
    anti-social, anti-business behavior?
JM: Well that's a difficult question..ahhhhhh you could say "why do we have
    criminals?" You know when you know there's plenty of gainful employment out
    there.  Ahhhhh the thing with the computer hackers uhhh most of them are
    thrill seekers. ahhh they are not the kind of people that are going to be
    ahhhh good achievers with computers they're really only know how to do the
    destructive things.  They're kind of the analog of the vandal.  Ahhhh
    they're not really ahhh some of them are very bright but they're very
    misguided.  Misdirected.  And uhhh it's it's kind of hard to make a
    generalization or a stereotype because they do kind of cover a wide
    spectrum.  We've got a one end of the spectrum a lot of these young kids
    ahhh teenagers.  And they mostly seem to be boys there is very few female
    hackers out there.
ES: really?
JM: Yeah that's an interesting phenomenon.  I would say that maybe there is one
    girl for every ten thousand boys.  But ahhh anyway at the one end of the
    spectrum we have these kids that are just kind of running loose they really
    don't know how to do very much but ahhhh when they do manage to do it they
    do a lot of damage.  Just by sheer numbers.  And then on the other end of
    the spectrum you perhaps got a the career criminal whose chosen to commit
    his crimes over the telephone line.  Instead of you know holding up people
    with guns uhhh he robs banks by telephone.  So you've got this wide
    spectrum and it's very hard to put a stereo type to it, but most of the
    hackers start out because there's kind of a thrill there's sort thrill of
    ripping off the phone company or breaking into a bank computer and
    destroying data or something. There's a ahhhh kind of a power trip
    involved.
ES: Now what you're trying to do is advise your clients how to avoid this
    before it happens.  Do most of them end up getting burned before they come
    to you or are people smart enough to invest early?
JM: Security unfortunately in the business world tends to take kind of a back
    seat because it doesn't generate profits, it doesn't generate any revenue.
    It's an expense uhhh if if you're worried about burglars and you live in a
    big city like I do or like Chicago.  Then you know you've got to spend
    extra money for locks and burglar alarms and it's a nuisance you've gotta
    unlock your door with three different keys and throw back all these dead
    bolts and stuff and turn the burglar alarm off and back on again when you
    leave so it's a big nuisance. So security tends to be left sort of as the
    last thing you do.  And uhhh of course after a corporations been hit their
    data's been damaged or stolen or destroyed or whatever.  Then they can't
    spend enough money, you know, to keep it from happening again.
ES: We have been told there is not premise that is burglar proof, there is no
    person regardless of their importance in this world who is totally
    protectable.  Is a computer or a computer system totally protectable?  I
    mean can you teach somebody how to secure the system so the hacker just
    can't get at it?
JM: Quite frankly you're you're correct. I think the only secure computer is
    one that is unplugged.  Or you change all the passwords and don't write
    them down so no one can log on.  Like any other form of security if you put
    enough locks and bars on your doors and windows the burglar's going to go
    somewhere else where its easier pickings.  The same is true with computer
    security.  You can secure your system from all but the really ummmm you
    know intense organized attack.  Now obviously in industry we've got certain
    segments that are targets, if you will.  Banks obviously are a target,
    that's where the money is.
ES: If computers are so capable and so smart, can't we say to a computer "Okay
    Computer, protect yourself"?
JM: The computer actually is fairly capable of defending itself, the only
    problem is it's not intelligent.  Uhh and it doesn't really care you see
    whether somebody breaks in or not. You see there's no human in the loop, if
    you will.  So you have to have you have to have a human someplace that
    looks at the exception report that the computer generates and says "hey!
    What's all these two o'clock in the morning logons...those accounts are
    supposed to be active at that time of night."  Now you can program a
    computer to do some of that, but you still need a human auditor to
    scrutinize the workings of the system ever now and then just to be sure
    that the computer is protecting what its supposed to protect.
ES: John, what's the name of your company?
JM: My company is called BoardScan and we're in Detroit Michigan
ES: We have some callers, first up is young lady by the name of Penny.  Are you
    there Penny?
P:  Yes I am Ed, how are you?
ES: Good.  Are you enjoying the program?
P:  Yes!  I'm a victim!
ES: A victim! Tell us how.
P:  We moved in about three months ago, two of our phones are rotary service
    and one of them is a cheapy touch-tone that you go from touch to pulse or
    something on it.  When somebody dials out on one of the rotary phones, this
    cheapy phone beeps back at us.  Well I don't mind it too much because I've
    got little kids and I get to know who's using the phone.  Except, 10:38 at
    night when my kids are sleeping and I'm sitting in the family room, my
    little touch-tone phone beeps at me. Twice.
JM: Oh I think I can explain that, perhaps.  Now it just beeps...
P:  Twice!
JM: It does it every night about the same time?
P:  Just about, yeah.
JM: Well there's an automatic scanner in every telephone exchange that runs at
    night testing lines.
ES: Oh no! Now wait a minute!
P:  Now wait a minute!  They said that doesn't happen! No no no no.
ES: The phone company all right.  This is the one thing that everybody we've
    talked to in the telephone industry has denied!
EZ: We, ahh, yeah....
ES: Go ahead Ed!  Take over, take over
EZ: We talked to a number of people at the phone company and the original
    thought was the phone company was doing some sort of testing, but the
    people at the phone company we talked to said "no...they don't."  That
    testing occurs only when the actual connection is made in a routine phone
    call.  This is part of the on-going sort of testing program.  There is no
    additional testing, however, they said.  Now does it work differently in
    Michigan?
JM: Well I don't know.  I know I have a phone that ahhh will ahh...it's got
    like a little buzzer in it and it will go "tick- tock" at about 1:30am
    every night.  And ummmm if you're on a if you're on one of the older
    electro-mechanical exchanges uhh then I dare say there is a scanner that
    does scan all the lines at night.  And it it only stops on each line for
    about oh a 1/2 second...just long enough to make your phone go beep-beep.
    And I'm sure that's what the explanation is. I am pretty qualified, before
    I got computer security work I used to install telephone exchanges.
P:  Okay, I have a home computer.  It's a Commodore I do not have a modem.  Is
    there anyway that I could get one and verify this?
JM: Ahhhhh I don't what a modem would have to do with the telephone company
    testing your line at 10:30 at night.  I don't see the connection there.
P:  What would verify it?  Could I verify that I'm being used as a test or
    would it verify that I'm being scanned by some other computer someplace?
JM: Well no.  If you were being scanned by a hacker, you'd be getting an actual
    ring, you wouldn't get just say a short beep.
EZ: Penny where do you live?
P:  Oaklawn.
EZ: Would you be willing to participate in a little experiment?
P:  Sure, it happens pretty regularly.
EZ: Okay. Well is it every night or just some nights?
P:  6 nights out of 10.  More than 50-50.  It happened tonight as a matter of
    fact.
EZ: Okay well tell you what.
P:  It happened last night as a matter of fact!
ES: Penny, we'll get your name and your number and Ed is going to
    call you during the day and do a little work with you, okay?
P:  Sounds good.
ES: Thanks Penny.  Hold on a minute okay?
P:  Thank you.
ES: You see now, Mr Maxfield is telling us something that every source we've
    gone to has denied.  There's no such thing they tell us as of random
    testing of the phone network either by the local phone company or by AT&T
    they say to us "what for?"  There's no need to do it.  There's no reason to
    do it.  Let me ask our guests in the studio here from Ameritech.  Has
    either one of you ever heard of anything like this?  Is it the kind of
    thing that either one of you can address?  I know that you're computer
    guys, but what about this?
CM: I know who you've talked to over at Illinois Bell Security and at one time
    historically they used to do testing, but they stopped that when I was
    still at Illinois Bell.
ES: So this is some years ago.
CM: Yeah.
EZ: Now did it only apply to the electro-mechanical systems?
CM: The only offices I ever worked out of were electro-mechanical, so yes.
JM: Well I don't know. That would be my first guess because I know when I was
    on electro-mechanical exchange here in Detroit that's what would happen
    every night.
ES: It's a different phone company.
JM: Well I know, it's the same equipment though.  Now on two electronic
    switching systems the line is tested every time you make a call.  So there
    isn't any scanner like that.  I think the mystery would be solved by just
    verifying what kind of equipment you know she was being served out of.
EZ: It never dawned on us that that would make a difference.

           (Commercial Break and then reintroductions including...)

ES: I've got a call coming in here long distance from Missouri. Anna are you
    there?
A:  Yes I am.
ES: Where in Missouri are you?
A:  I'm in Kansas City.
ES: And you're listening to us tonight?
A:  Yes.
ES: Okay now my producer tells me that when you called up you identified
    yourself as a computer hacker, is that correct?
A:  I am a female phone hacker and computer hacker, Yes.
ES: One of the few because apparently mostly males are into this.
A:  Uh-huh.
ES: Anna, talk up a little bit louder.  How old are you?
A:  I'm 27.
ES: Twenty seven years old and do you have a job?
A:  No.
ES: You don't?!
A:  No I have a lot of idle time.
ES: And you're a computer hacker. By definition what do you do
    with your computer that makes you a hacker?
A:  Well I scan out codes that residents and companies have with US Sprint and
    different companies and I've used about fifteen thousand dollars worth of
    free long distance.
ES: Are you calling free right now?
A:  Yes I am. I am not paying for this call.
ES: Your computer has allowed you to make an illegal long distance call?
A:  Through the computer I obtain the codes and then I dial codes with the
    touch-tone.
ES: Sergeant, should I be talking to her since she's committing crime right
    now.  Am I aiding and abetting her? No wait..no.  I've got a police officer
    on here....Sarge?
AA: Yes.
ES: What do you think?  Should we continue with this?
AA: I'd be real curious to know what her justification is for her behavior.
ES: How about that Ann, how about giving us an answer for this?
A:  Well I have a lot of idle time and very little money and I like to talk to
    a lot of my friends.  I have a suggestion for companies and residents out
    there who might have remote access codes.  You might make them difficult,
    not not easy where hackers could, you know the first things they try are
    like 1-2-3-4, etc.
ES: Well let me ask you a question Anna.  Have you found your computer hacking
    to be relatively easy to do?
A:  Yes I have.
ES: So you're saying that the computer people of the world have not tried hard
    enough to keep you out?
A:  No they haven't.  I would suggest as far as the phone companies who use
    remote access codes to make the codes more difficult.
ES: When we run into people like Anna who obviously have some intuitive talent
    and some success at this, why don't we hire some of these people and put
    their knowledge to work?
AA: No!
ES: No?
JM: No. No.  I'd have to say no to that also.
A:  Why not?
JM: You have to understand the the technical side of it.  Just knowing how to
    hack out a code doesn't qualify you as knowing how to change they system so
    you can't hack codes anymore.
AA: There's a perception that these people are all whiz-kids and I don't think
    that's the case.
ES: Are you a whiz-kid Anna?
A:  No, I don't always use the computer to find these codes I have a lot of
    friends and I also do some hacking of my own and there are a lot of
    different methods.  What you figure out is what how many digits are in the
    codes and different things like that so it does require some brains.
    Unless you have friends of course and that's all you rely on.
ES: Do you not understand that what you are doing is illegal?  Does that not
    even enter into the equation?
A:  Of course I understand that!  Yes.
ES: That what you are doing somebody else ultimately has to pay for Doesn't
    that bother you?  I mean if you were the victim of a thief or a burglar, I
    presume you would call the police and you'd scream and yell until they did
    something about it. And yet you and so many thousands of other people think
    nothing of committing thievery and fraud by wire and God knows what other
    crimes and because your victim is not sitting in the same room with you it
    just doesn't seem to bother you.
A:  Well I haven't I haven't physically bodily hurt anybody and it's mostly
    companies you know that I've dealt with.
ES: That makes it okay?  Companies are made up of people. Sometimes they're
    privately owned and sometimes they're made up of stockholders, but
    companies are people and so you're hurting people.
CM: I don't know what service she's coming through on, but you gotta remember
    its costing that company money right now to enable her to talk and they've
    got to recover those costs from their legitimate customers.
A:  Don't they just use it as a tax write-off?
BG: No.
JM: There's been some of the smaller long distance companies, some of the
    people that resell service provided by AT&T or Sprint, some of these
    smaller companies have actually been bankrupted by people like Anna.
A:  Well I happen to know the person who bankrupted one of them.
AA: I don't see why that's something that would make anybody proud.
A:  I'm not proud to know this person.
AA: Why would you be proud to do what you're doing because you're doing the
    exact same thing, just perhaps not at the same scale.
A:  Well I don't I don't deal with small time companies.
AA: So, you and many people like you are costing large companies a enormous sum
    of money.  You're the people you're the reason that a company like Sprint
    is not profitable and could in fact bankrupt or could have to lay people
    off and could put people out of work.
A:  They're not profitable?
JM: Sprint has been losing money almost since the beginning.
CM: Or just make a basic rate increase which makes phone service less
    affordable.
EZ: My long distance company is All-Net which has had to change access codes
    three times in the last year.  Primarily because of hackers and I don't
    think it's ever been profitable.
CM: Which is inconvenient to you as a customer.
EZ: Sure
ES: I think what bothers me the most out of this whole thing with Anna is the
    fact that she is, committing crime literally every day and just doesn't
    acknowledge that as either morally offensive.
JM: Yes you've hit on the crux of the problem here.  Ahhh these phone phreaks
    and hackers really don't see themselves as criminals and the crime here is
    totally anonymous it's as simple as dialing some numbers on a telephone
    that belong to someone else.  Okay and so there is no victim.  I mean the
    hacker or the phone phreak doesn't even know the victim that ahh they're
    billing the call to.  In most cases.
ES: Like the burglar who burglarizes during the day when nobody is home he
    doesn't see the faces of his victims and so its a very impersonal crime.
    Anna how would you feel if someday you get  a knock on the door and it's
    the FBI or the Secret Service and they have finally tracked you down and
    the US Attorney for Kansas City decides to indict you and they've got a
    good case and you end up going to prison.  How would you feel then?
A:  My original reason for taking an interest in this particular hobby is that
    someone got hold of my AT&T calling card and ran up my phone bill to
    several thousand dollars and I took an interest in it to find out
    originally what was going on with it.  Now I have had contact with the
    Secret Service and the FBI and they didn't do anything about the person who
    offended me.  They didn't do anything at all.
AA: That doesn't answer the question.
ES: Well what's going to happen if they come back and grab you?  How would you
    feel if you ended up having to go to prison?
A:  I guess those are the breaks.
ES: Are you married or single?
A:  I'm single.
ES: Does your family know that you're involved in all this?
A:  Yes they do.
ES: I mean how would they react if you ended up being arrested?
A:  I guess they wouldn't get anymore free long distance.
ES: They're using it too!?
A:  They have me place the calls for them.
ES: You know what disturbs me.  You know don't sound like a stupid person, but
    you represent a lack of morality that disturbs me greatly.  You really do.
    I think you represent a certain way of thinking that is morally bankrupt.
    I'm not trying to offend you, but I'm offended by you!
A:  Well I appreciate your time and you giving me air time an everything.  I
    thought I'd let some of you know that we are out there and look out for us.
    Change those remote access codes to more difficult codes and...
BG: Is that to make the challenge more difficult for you?
A:  Possibly for some of us, but to also those hackers who don't have the
    intelligence or don't have the friends or don't have the computers or
    whatever they're using.
BG: Or the idle time.
A:  Right, the idle time.  There you go.
ES: How do you pay your rent Anna?  Or do you live at home with your folks?
A:  I live with my parents.
ES: Oh...okay.
AA: Why not take that time and do something constructive or socially useful?
A:  Well I went out and applied for a job with US. Sprint and didn't get hired.
AA: That's good!
EZ: Is it any wonder?!
ES: Anna, do you listen to this program very often?  I don't believe you've
    ever called before have you?
A:  No.
ES: Do you listen every once in a while?
A:  Yes.  I had just happened to hear through a friend that it was coming on.
ES: Okay.  I tell you what Anna.  A little something for all new callers.  I've
    got very fancy WGN T-shirts.  If you give my producer your name and address
    we'll send one to you.  Okay?
A:  Okay
ES: We'll be right back. (Click!) She hung up.  I have to tell you the truth.
    I thought we had her there for a minute.
AA: Well done!
JM: She hung up on you?
ES: The minute we went in on the line to get her address to send her the prize
    she hung up.
JM: Yeah, I don't doubt that.
ES: I'm not trying to make an enemy out of the woman, but I really am disturbed
    by her lack of moral fiber.  I got another person on the phone claiming to
    be a computer hacker.  Dan, are you there?
D:  Yes
ES: Are you a computer hacker?
D:  No. I'm a computer science major.
ES: Oh, okay.
D:  I'd like to ask your security experts what types of risk avoidance is
    involved in providing unauthorized people into corporation's computer
    systems?
BG: What you're asking us is what we do to try to keep unauthorized people out
    and for me to answer that, would give away the store.
AA: Besides it would take about two days.
JM: I think you can answer that in generalities.  As a number we're talking
    about I guess, telephone dial-up access to computers.
BG: I think he's asking generically.  Just computing.  I don't think it would
    be appropriate for me to discuss.  There is enough literature out there,
    you're a computer science major you read the literature and I think your
    answer lies there.
EZ: Just to give you an example I know in terms not so much as computers, but
    misuse of long distance credit card numbers, the All-Net people who I deal
    with made their numbers longer which is the simplest thing you can do.
    It's harder to find one that's working.
JM: When protecting your computers, the first line of defense is the password.
    Obviously you don't want to use trivial passwords.  Ahhh that's the first
    line of defense.  After that you add on other things like dial-back,
    encryption and various other techniques to rule out anyone with just a
    casual ahhh attempt at access that is just not going to get through.
ES: Dan, where are you going to school?
D:  Right across the street from WGN, the Devry institute.
ES: What is your feeling when you hear somebody else talk about, you just heard
    Anna, what what's your feeling about what she's doing?
D:  I'm not really familiar with the hackers.
ES: Don't you see things being stolen?  Does that bother you at all?  I mean
    you see the illegality of it? The immoral...morality of it?
D:  I think it's very unethical because a lot of the companies have billions of
    dollars in equipment.
ES: It's not something you're into?  Correct?
D:  That's correct, yes.
ES: I'm glad.  Thanks for your call Dan.
D:  Okay.
ES: Hello Louis are you there?
L:  Yes I'm here.
ES: Okay you're on with all of our panel members Louis.
L:  Thank you very much. I heard a story that had to do with a certain hacker
    who had gotten inside the computer system of a let's say a large oil
    company.  We'll leave the names out of it.  They had set up a security
    system which automatically traces the call directly back to wherever the
    originating connection is made and this goof called from his home.  Two or
    three days later, he found FBI agents on his front door step.
AA: I'm not familiar with the case, but it's certainly is within the realm of
    possibility.
JM: This happens quite a bit.  A person like Anna for example might use a long
    distance service that is subscribing to a service from the originating
    telephone company of identification of calling number.  When the fraudulent
    bill is generated the number that placed the call is also there and working
    it backwards is very trivial at that point.
L:  They simply did something like putting a trap on the line.
JM: On some of the systems, the trap is already there. It's just part of the
    system, it's not really a trap at all.
ES: There are ways to catch people and the computer hackers like to play the
    odds.  All right Louis thank you.
L:  Hopefully this will teach a lot of people who are considering doing
    something like this to keep their hands off.
ES: I hope so, good point.  Thanks for the call.
L:  Thank you very much
ES: We've got a call here.  Hello Bob!
B:  I'd like to make a few comments on computer law.  I live in Oaklawn and
    they've got the most modern exchanges that Illinois Bell has to offer.  My
    son lives in that area and I know they offer features that are only
    available on the newer switches out there.  I go back with computers to
    before Apple and IBM sold PC's, I had a couple sitting here at home.
ES: Uh-humm.
B:  I bought my first modem about 1978.  I consider myself somewhat a hacker,
    but I've never really tried to get into anybody else's system, not so much
    that I considered it illegal, simply because there wasn't that much of
    interest to me available.  As far as computers go, if I sit here and dial
    random phone numbers in some states, now that is illegal.  It's illegal if
    your 14 year old is sitting at home at a computer, but it's not illegal if
    your using a computerized phone system for generating sales leads.
ES: We call it tele-marketing.
B:  Tele-marketing is essentially what some hackers have been hassled for and n
    some states it is illegal now.  I've accidentally accessed systems I did
    not intend to access.
CM: You didn't pursue that right?
B:  No, I've never used it.  I've never used a computer for theft of services.
    I am not about to try and defend somebody that uses a computer to as a tool
    for theft of service from a telecommunications company. However, there are
    certain computer laws that never should have been passed.  The case of the
    fellow out in California two or three years back that had a bulletin board,
    somebody had posted access codes on his bulletin board.  He has an
    automated machine that answers his telephone.  The telephone line is in his
    name, the Secret Service came and confiscated his equipment Its not right
    that this happened because of third party theft of service.
BG: I think the rationale is over simplistic.
B:  Am I responsible for what you say when I answer my phone is essentially the
    question.
BG: No, I think the question is, is the bulletin board operator responsible for
    what is posted on his bulletin board.
B:  Well that literally makes no sense.  If a telemarketer calls me am I
    responsible for anything he says after I pick up the phone?
BG: A bulletin board is used to disseminate information further.  When a person
    posts something, in this case a code, the bulletin board is used to further
    spread that information.
JM: I believe that is the Tom Tcimpidis case that you're referring to and I'm
    quite familiar with it.  It was not quite as you put it.  The stolen AT&T
    calling card that was posted was posted anonymously one minute and one
    minute after the AT&T card being posted by the anonymous party, Tom
    Tcimpidis, the sysop, the operator of the bulletin board himself had been
    on-line and had posted other messages.  So there was reason to believe
    perhaps that the anonymous person was actually the system operator.  There
    was a further complication that arose in that the stolen AT&T card belonged
    to a former employer of the system operator.  Ultimately there was not
    enough evidence with which to charge anybody and the whole thing was
    quietly dropped, but it did raise some interesting questions as to
    responsibilities of the system operator because Mr. Tcimpidis said that he
    didn't know the code was there and yet his own equipment log showed that he
    had been on-line.
B:  Let's take that a little further then.  Let's say there was an answering
    machine connected to his phone and we know he listened to the answering
    machine. Let's say somebody with a voice message left him half a dozen
    stolen credit card numbers.  Would the action of the law enforcement
    agencies have been the same?
JM: No...no, you're
B:  I think you must look at a situation where over the years an unnecessary
    fear has grown of some of the hackers.  The phone phreaks scare me to an
    extent.  I've got bogus calls on my US. Sprint and All-Net bills, never got
    one on my AT&T bill.  I can see this is a definite problem, the phone
    phreaks do scare me, and I realize that real problem is that nobody seems
    to reconcile every call or even read their long distance bills.
AA: If I have an answering machine on my phone and somebody calls up and leaves
    me information that were I to use it it would be illegal and I either erase
    the information or turn that other person in.  I have no intent to use it
    and there is no law enforcement officer that I can imagine who is going to
    take action and no prosecutor who would take the case.
ES: In other words if a guy sets up a computer bulletin board for the express
    purpose of exchanging information he is not supposed to have when other
    people have information their not supposed to have, I don't think there's
    any doubt about what their intent is and about the fact that they are
    violating the law.

    Sarge, if you went after somebody like Anna for what she admitted doing,
    stealing $15,000 dollars worth of long distance and you were able to handle
    the investigation, come up with the evidence, and bust her,  what kind of
    penalty might she get?
AA: A very difficult question to answer because it depends upon her prior
    criminal history.  Most of these hackers do not have a history.  In Anna's
    case the crime would be a class four felony which would result in probably
    simple felony probation.
ES: She admitted to stealing $15,000!
AA: I'm sure that her estimate is wildly off on the low end. if she is
    disseminating codes then she is also somewhat responsible for other
    people's use of the same codes.
ES: Could we charge someone like her with conspiracy?
AA: Sure!
ES: She is generating a continuing criminal enterprise.
AA: It depends again on whether you choose to prosecute her federally or at the
    state level.  She would be looking here at a class three or class two
    felony depending upon the sum of money that she had stolen.
ES: The bottom line here is if the punishment doesn't fit the crime, its not
    going to stop the criminals.
AA: You have to remember that these are the people who have not been processed
    in the criminal justice systems and even to hold them over the weekend in
    Cook County would not be an experience I'd care to repeat.
ES: Many of them are pretty arrogant sounding it seems.

                    (Commercial Break And Reintroductions)

ES: We've got an interesting new telephone law here; Chapter 38 of the Illinois
    Criminal Code.  A person can be prosecuted, arrested and convicted for
    bothering somebody even if the person doesn't answer the phone.  Just
    ringing a persons phone now is against the law, it's harassing them.
JM: I might add, since we're discussing harassment by phone... the hackers
    don't like me too well and I'll get about a death threat a week from a
    hacker.
ES: Really.
JM: Oh yeah and every now and then I figure out who it was and I call them back
    and that kind of shakes up a little bit.
ES: There was this reporter here that was being harassed like crazy in the news
    department here by a hacker who had a computer that was ringing the phone.
    He was ringing the phones like crazy and I didn't know about.  Finally the
    reporter asked what I could recommend.  I made a phone call and the
    Illinois Bell Security did what it had to do and then the Chicago Police
    were brought in and one night when I was on the air the officers went to
    guys home, knocked on the door, and this kid was shocked!  He was a
    telemarketing representative for a major magazine and apparently he was
    working at home he had some of their equipment at home including a rapid
    dialer.  He's got two detectives at the front door and he had literally
    just gotten off the phone.  We've got all the data and so now comes the
    decision what do you want to do.  Take him to court?  Lock him up?  Go to
    his boss?  I went back to the reporter in our news room and asked him what
    he wanted to do about it?
JM: What did he say?
ES: Write a 500 word essay on why he was never going to do it again.
JM: Ha Ha!  We had one 14 year old one hacker who was on the bulletin boards
    and posting messages about how to make pipe bombs, different types of
    poison, long distance codes, and computer passwords, etc.  On the bulletin
    boards he would come across like Ghengis Khan or or Joseph Stalin or
    something.  I mean his language was all four letter words and yet face to
    face he was a very meek, mild mannered, well behaved youngster.  However,
    get him behind the keyboard and he just sort of changes personality.  What
    do you do to a 14 year old?  He is much too young to really be put through
    any of the the serious criminal prosecutions so his penalty was that he had
    to read out loud to his parents all of the messages that he'd posted on the
    bulletin boards, four letters words and all.  And that cured him... hahaha.

    In most of the cases I've worked on it's rare that someone goes to jail.  I
    think the longest sentence that I've been involved with was probably like
    30 days.  I think there was one fellow down in Virginia, if I recall
    correctly, that got 90 days.  You don't necessarily want to put these
    folks in jail because then they'll meet the real crooks and teach them all
    these nifty tricks.
ES: God help us.  Lets grab a call real quick here from Gordon.  Hello Gordon,
    where are you calling from?
G:  Hello, I'm calling from DeKalb, Illinois.
ES: You have a question for our panel...go ahead.
G:  Yeah I do.  I'm a graduate student in Criminology up here at Northern
    Illinois University and I'm kinda involved in some field research with the
    types of people that you're discussing tonight.  I've heard a lot of terms
    flying back and forth between phreakers and hackers and things like that.
    I'd like to hear some input from the people on the panel as far as how they
    define these types of activities, if they draw and distinctions between the
    two, and secondly, if anybody can add any insight into maybe just how many
    people are currently active in this type of activity.
JM: I could take that because one of my specialties is identification and
    gathering data about how many perpetrators there are.  To answer the first
    question, a computer hacker would be someone who concentrates mainly on
    breaking into computer systems.  The phone phreak would be someone who,
    like Anna we heard earlier tonight, just makes long distance calls for
    free.  The problem is you can't really separate them.  The hacker needs to
    know the phone phreak tricks in order to break into computers in other
    states or other countries.  Certainly the phone phreak perhaps needs some
    computer aids in obtaining stolen codes.  It is hard to separate them.  You
    can call them phreakers or you can call them hackers or you can just call
    them criminals.

    As to how many, this is a tough one because at what point to you draw the
    line?  Do you say somebody that makes fifteen thousand dollars worth of
    calls in a year is a phone phreak and somebody that makes $14,900 is not?
    The problem is that its been a tradition to rip off the phone company ever
    since day one.  There has been phone phreaks for twenty-five or thirty
    years at least.  Ever since we've had long distance dialing.
BG: The phone companies not the only one under siege either.
JM: There are thousands of hackers, I would say just in the state of Illinois
    there are several thousand active computer hackers.
G:  Those hackers are the active ones?  Would you say that most of them are
    involved in communicating via the bulletin board systems and voice
    mail-boxes and things like that or is this pretty much a solitary activity.
JM: There are a few solitary hackers, in fact the beginnings of hacking, 25-30
    years ago, it was a solitary activity.  The bulletin boards have changed
    all that.  Now the hackers no longer really operate in solitude.
AA: One thing also about the criminal element here, the hacker and the
    phreakers, my experience has been that we have had very few "clean" if you
    will, computer frauds.  We have had some people who are only into
    multi-level marketing of codes, which ends up being enormous sums of money,
    but very often we've found that hackers are involved in other things too.
    For example, credit card frauds, we have done search warrants and found a
    reasonable quantities of illegal substances, of weapons, of other evidence
    of other offenses.  We have probably easily 50% of our warrants turn up
    other things besides computer fraud.  Which I think is an interesting point
    to keep in mind.
ES: Very good point.

                  (Break For Commercial and re-introductions)

R:  Hello, I just wanted to call up and clarify something concerning computer
    hackers.  I'm a hacker, but I'm not a criminal.
ES: We'll be the judge of that Bobby.
R:  I think you will be.  The reason I say that is, you're confusing things.
    The hacker is term that you could apply or compare more or less to "ham."
    It's a computer hobbyist, whether he does it just on his machine at home or
    he accesses legitimate services throughout the country and pays for his
    services he's a hacker.  There are a lot of people who are irresponsible,
    mostly teenagers, who are quite impressed with the power of this machine
    and get carried away with it and do criminal acts.  They happen to be
    hackers, but they're also criminals.  I think that distinction.
CM: I think the point is well taken I think originally the hacker was a very
    positive term historically and for whatever reasons the word hacker has
    taken on some negative connotations.
R:  Yes and that is unfair because I know legions of people who are hackers.
JM: I consider myself to be a hacker, but I'm certainly not a computer criminal
    (No, at least not a COMPUTER criminal).  I mean my business is catching the
    criminal hackers.  If we go back to 1983 when hackers made headlines for
    the first time, that was the Milwaukee 414 gang, they called themselves
    hackers and so right away the good term, hacker being someone who could do
    wonderful things with a computer got turned into someone who could do
    criminal things with a computer.
ES: I remember back to a time a few years ago when there was a group of
    criminals that got busted for coming up with a device called a black box
    which they used to circumvent paying the tolls you know on long distance
    phone charges.  Was that kind of the beginning of this computer
    misbehavior?  I mean was that a computer device?
JM: There are several boxes; the black box, blue box, red box, silver box, etc.
    I must confess that back when I was a teenager, over thirty years ago,
    there were not any computers to play around with, but there was this
    wonderful telephone network called the Bell System.  I was one of the
    original inventors of the device known as the black box and another device
    known as the blue box (Yeah right, YOU invented these).  In those days the
    phone network was such that you could manipulate it with very simple tone
    signals.

    A black box essentially allows all calls to your phone to be received free
    of charge to the caller.  In other words if somebody called you from a
    payphone they got their dimes back and if someone dialed you direct long
    distance they never got a bill.

    The blue box was a little more insidious.  It allows you to actually take
    over the long distance lines and dial direct anywhere in the world.
    I got into it just out of curiosity as a true hacker and I found out that
    these things were possible and I told a friend of mine at the phone company
    about what I could do with their circuits and of course he turned me into
    the security people.

    It never really got started, but I do have sitting here in front of me a
    device that makes some of those tones.  You could call it a blue box.  I
    guess this is legitimate piece of test equipment, but let's see if it will
    pick up. (Beeeep!)
ES: Came through loud and clear.
JM: The blue box today is obsolete, it really doesn't work anymore.  There,
    there are a few circuits that still us those kind of signals, but back
    25-30 years ago that was the way to make your free phone calls. You didn't
    have Sprint and MCI to abuse.
S:  I'm a consulting engineer now but, I have been a communications manager for
    three Fortune 500 companies.  One of the reasons I was hired was to put a
    stop to some long distance calling that had cost that company over a
    million and a half dollars in 27 months.  We found the person that was
    doing it and he got a suspended sentence of six months.  Then we turned
    around and sued him in civil court.
ES: We've got to start treating these criminals like criminals.  Suspended
    sentences are unacceptable, hard jail time is absolutely mandatory and
    unfortunately, and I think that sergeant you probably will agree with me,
    it must be very frustrating to spend all the hours you do chasing people
    and even when you get them to plead guilty seeing how easy sometimes they
    get away.
AA: Oh sure.
S:  How many people do you have assigned to your unit here in this state sarge?
AA: You're talking to 50% of the unit.

                 (Break for commercials and re-introductions)

ES: Okay Ray, go ahead.
R:  You would not believe how long I've been trying to get in touch with you.
    Since I was 14 years old, every time I've called, you've been busy.
ES: So how old are you tonight?
R:  18
ES: Four years!?  What's on your mind?
R:  I used to pirate games when I was younger. As a matter of fact when I was
    14.  I mean my Dad had just bought me a computer and modem and I was
    pumped.  People are always complaining about it, but it's so easy for a 14
    year old kid to do this, don't you think that they should make it a little
    bit harder?  Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
ES: Yes, but Ray it's easy to steal a car.  If your neighbor leaves his car in
    the driveway with the key in the ignition does that give you the right to
    take it?
R:  I know I did wrong, but there is no way I can give it back.  Its just
    stupid because when you get older you feel guilty about things.
ES: What did you used to do?
R:  I used to call up certain places and I would like break in and take their
    games and then just keep them for myself.
BG: It was more entertainment for you?
R:  It kept me occupied and it was so easy that I began to think that maybe it
    was meant to be easy so they could get publicity.
JM: There is perhaps a difference because when you copy a a computer program
    you can't tell it from an original, but if you make a copy of a tape or a
    record it doesn't sound quite the same.
CM: When you're 14 years old it's something new, right?
R:  I got the biggest pump out of it.
CM: I think you did something for your ego and it gave you a sense of power.
ES: Okay Ray
R:  Bye
ES: I've really enjoyed this program, but we're out of time.  John, I want to
    thank you for staying up and I have a feeling that we'll do more radio
    because you're an interesting guy.
JM: Thank you.  It's been interesting talking with you.  By the way, I think I
    know who Anna is, but we'll keep that a secret from our listeners.
ES: Oh.  Well why don't you just tell the FBI?
JM: The Secret Service, yes.
ES: Right and I want to thank everyone else for being on the show tonight.
Everyone: Its been our pleasure.  Lets do it again some time.

On The Edge Of Forever                                         November 4, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Greetings and welcome to Phrack World News Issue XXI!  As most of you have
realized, Taran King and I are back to stay and the tradition of Phrack Inc.
lives on.  November 17, 1988 marks the Three Year Anniversary of Phrack Inc.
and we have never been prouder of our efforts to bring you the best magazine
possible.

However, we can not do it alone.  Both Taran King and I have been reduced to
completely legal status and can not afford the luxury of calling bulletin
boards or contacting all the people we would like too.

Epsilon has been helping us a lot by acting as the collection agency for many
of the files for Phrack and several news articles as well.  Please, if you have
a file for Phrack Inc. or an article for PWN contact him or leave mail for The
Mentor.  And speaking of The Mentor, The Phoenix Project has a new number;
(512) 441-3088.  Be sure to give it a call.

The article about Pacific Bell in this issue may contain some information that
has been seen before.  Regardless of that, PWN is a place where such
information can be indexed for later reference and helps keep important events
and happenings in a certain continuity which is beneficial to everyone.

This issue of Phrack features the Second Special Presentation of Phrack World
News, which contains the abridged edition of the WGN Radio Show that dealt with
computer hackers and features John Maxfield.

With regard to the file about Teleconnect Long Distance.  Hatchet Molly says
that now Teleconnect "flags" suspect bulletin boards and if a Teleconnect
calling card is used to call one, the card number is cancelled and a new card
is mailed to the customer within three days.  What a wonderful company policy
that is.

For the months ahead, I am working on a file about hackers abroad, mostly
focusing on the Chaos Computer Club, which I have begun to have strong
relations with, and some other hacker instances in Europe and other parts of
the world.

Scheduled for January/February is a file series on the Wide Area Networks;
Bitnet and quite possibly ARPAnet, MILInet, NSFnet, IBM's VNET, CCnet, UUCP,
CSnet, SPAN, JANet, JUNet, and the list goes on.  The main emphasis will be on
Bitnet though with secondary emphasis on UUCP and the other networks.

Hope you enjoy this issue and remember...               "The Future Is Forever"

Subject:  Unauthorized Remote Computer Access

     San Francisco, July 29, 1987
     Case Nos.: 86-883, 87-497

T. M. CASSANI, Director-Electronic Operations:

Electronic Operations recently investigated two cases involving a number of
sophisticated hackers who were adept at illegally compromising public and
private sector computers.  Included among the victims of these hackers was
Pacific Bell, as well as other local exchange carriers and long distance
providers.

Below is a synopsis of the two cases (87-497 and 86-883), each of which
demonstrate weaknesses in Pacific Bell's remote access dial-up systems.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Case No. 87-497
---------------
On May 14, 1987, Electronic Operations received a court order directing Pacific
Bell to place traps on the telephone numbers assigned to a company known as
"Santa Cruz Operations."  The court order was issued in order to identify the
telephone number being used by an individual who was illegally entering Santa
Cruz Operations' computer and stealing information.

On May 28, 1987, a telephone number was identified five separate times making
illegal entry into Santa Cruz Operations' computer. The originating telephone
number was 805-PRE-SUFF, which is listed to Jane Doe, 8731 W. Cresthill Drive,
Apt. 404, Thousand Oaks, California.

On June 3, 1987, a search warrant was served at 8731 W. Cresthill Drive, Apt
404, Thousand Oaks, California.  The residents of the apartment, who were not
at home, were identified as Jane Doe, a programmer for General Telephone, and
Kevin Hacker, a known computer hacker.  Found inside the apartment were three
computers, numerous floppy disks and a number of General Telephone computer
manuals.

Kevin Hacker was arrested several years ago for hacking Pacific Bell, UCLA and
Hughes Aircraft Company computers.  Hacker was a minor at the time of his
arrest.  Kevin Hacker was recently arrested for compromising the data base of
Santa Cruz Operations.

The floppy disks that were seized pursuant to the search warrant revealed
Mitnick's involvment in compromising the Pacific Bell UNIX operation systems
and other data bases.  The disks documented the following:

  o  Hacker's compromise of all Southern California SCC/ESAC computers.  On
     file were the names, log-ins, passwords, and home telephone numbers for
     Northern and Southern ESAC employees.

  o  The dial-up numbers and circuit identification documents for SCC computers
     and Data Kits.

  o  The commands for testing and seizing trunk testing lines and channels.

  o  The commands and log-ins for COSMOS wire centers for Northern and Southern
     California.

  o  The commands for line monitoring and the seizure of dial tone.

  o  References to the impersonation of Southern California Security Agents and
     ESAC employees to obtain information.

  o  The commands for placing terminating and originating traps.

  o  The addresses of Pacific Bell locations and the Electronic Door Lock
     access codes for the following Southern California central offices ELSG12,
     LSAN06, LSAN12, LSAN15, LSAN23, LSAN56, AVLN11, HLWD01, HWTH01, IGWD01,
     LOMT11, AND SNPD01.

  o  Inter-company Electronic Mail detailing new login/password procedures and
     safeguards.

  o  The work sheet of an UNIX encryption reader hacker file. If successful,
     this program could break into any UNIX system at will.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Case No. 86-883
---------------
On November 14, 1986, Electronic Operations received a search warrant directing
Pacific Bell to trap calls being made to the Stanford University computer.  The
Stanford Computer was being illegally accessed and was then being used to
access other large computer systems throughout the country.

The calls to the Stanford Computer were routed through several different common
carriers and through numerous states.  Through a combination of traps, traces
and sifting through information posted on the Stanford computer, several
suspects were identified throughout the United States.

The group of computer hackers who illegally accessed the Stanford computer
system were known as "The Legion of Doom."  Subsequent investigation indicated
that the Legion of Doom was responsible for:

  o  The use of Stanford University high-speed mainframes to attack and hack
     ESAC/SCC mini compuuters with an UNIX password hacker file.  Password
     files were then stored on the Stanford systems for other members of the
     Legion of Doom to use.  Login and passwords for every local exchange
     carrier as well as AT&T SCC/ESAC mini computers were on file.

  o  The Legion of Doom used the Stanford computers to enter and attack other
     institutions and private contractors' computers.  Some of the contractors'
     computers were used for national defense research.

On July 21, 1987, eight search warrants were served in three states at homes
where members of the Legion of Doom reside.  Three of the searches were
conducted in California.  Steve Dougherty, Senior Investigator-Electronic
Operations, accompanied Secret Service agents at the service of a search
warrant at 2605 Trousdale Drive, Burlingame, California, which was the
residence of Stan QUEST, a sixteen-year-old member of the Legion of Doom.
(Correction - Oryan QUEST has never been a member of the Legion Of Doom.   -KL)

Dougherty interviewed QUEST, who had used the pseudonym "O'Ryan Quest," (Oryan
QUEST) when accessing computers.  During the interview, QUEST admitted the
following:

  o  The entering of central offices, (Burlingame, San Mateo, San Bruno,
     Millbrae) disguised as a Federal Express deliveryman.  The entries were
     done to case out the CO's for the purpose of finding computer terminals
     with telephones, the locations of switches and bays, the names of
     Comtechs, and materials related to the operations of the central office.
     QUEST also claimed to have been in the AT&T Administration office on
     Folsom Street, San Francisco.

  o  QUEST's telephone service had been disconnected twice for nonpayment, and
     twice he had his service restored by impersonating a service
     representative.

  o  Learning to test circuits and trunks with his computer by using ROTL and
     CAROT test procedures.

  o  Members of the Legion of Doom often accessed test trunks to monitor each
     other's lines for fun.

  o  On several occasions QUEST would post the telephone number of a public
     coin phone for access to his BBS, Digital IDS.  He would then access teh
     Millbrae COSMOS wire center and add call forwarding to the coin phone.  He
     would activate the call forwarding to his home telephone number, securing
     the identity of his location.

  o  QUEST would impersonate an employee who had authorization to use a Data
     Kit and have it turned on for him.  When he was done, he would call back
     and have the Data Kit turned off.

  o  QUEST also would use his knowledge to disconnect and busyout the telephone
     services of individuals he did not like.  Further, he would add several
     custom calling features to their lines to create larger bills.

  o  It was very easy to use the test trunks with his computer to seize another
     person's dial tone and make calls appear on their bills.  QUEST did not
     admit charging 976 calls to anyone, but he knew of others who did.

  o  When the Legion of Doom attacked a computer system, they gave themselves
     five minutes to complete the hacking.  If they were not successful in five
     minutes, they would attempt another system.  The Legion of Doom was able
     to crack a computer in under five minutes approximately 90% of the time.

  o  QUEST would impersonate employees to get non-published telephone listings.
     QUEST received the non-published listing for Apple Computer Founder, Steve
     Wozniak, and members of The Beastie Boys rock group.

  o  QUEST told Dougherty of one New York member of the Legion of Doom, "Bill
     from Arnoc," (Bill From RNOC) who has been placing his own traps in New
     York.  Bill from Arnoc (Bill From RNOC) helped QUEST place traps in
     Pacific Bell.

         (Gee Stan, you forgot to admit sneaking over the border. -KL)

The review of the evidence seized at QUEST's residence tends to corroborate all
QUEST's statements.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Conclusions
-----------
There are some important conclusions that can be drawn from the above two cases
regarding future computer system concerns.

  o  The number of individuals capable of entering Pacific Bell operating
     systems is growing.

  o  Computer Hackers are becoming more sophisticated in their attacks.

  o  Dial-up ports will always be a target for computer entry by a hacker.

  o  Even dial-up ports with remote callbacks and manually controlled modems
     can be compromised.

  o  A hacker can place a central office off-line by overloading a SCC mini
     computer by improperly placing traps or by putting traps on several DID
     multi-trunk groups such as MCI or Sprint groups.

  o  Terrorist or Organized Crime organizations could use this underground
     computer technology against Pacific Bell or to their own advantage.

  o  Pacific Bell proprietary data bases such as PTT ESAC or PB2 ESAC could be
     compromised.

  o  The integrity of accurate customer billing statements have been
     compromised through access to the CEBS (Computerized Electronic Billing
     System) and will remain questionable.  A customer can dispute large
     direct-dialed calls and claim his telephone was accessed by a computer
     hacker.
                                     - - -
  o  Oryan QUEST has a really BIG mouth and would dick over anyone and everyone
     to overcome his inferiority complex from being an illegal alien without a
     green card.  Outside of the Dan The Operator/Maxfield incident, I have
     never seen such a mass admission of guilt.  To make matters worse, QUEST
     probably made up most of the incidents to make himself sound like a really
     big time hacker.
                                     - - -
Recommendations
---------------
The information gained as a result of the above investigations should be shared
with those individuals responsible for the integrity of our computer systems.
Further, an ongoing business partnership between security and the individuals
responsible for the integrity of our computer systems should be initiated and
maintained to ensure prompt, effective resolution of future computer related
security issues.

He's Really Just Out Of Control                                      PostCon'88
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      "I would SHRED everything, because
                       we get so much information
                       out of the dumpster,
                       it's UNREAL..."

                       -- Control C

Over the last few months there has been a lot of controversy about the
mysterious cricumstances regarding Michigan Bell and Control C.  To set the
record straight, ^C gave me the full details of what happened so I could pass
it on to you.

Just prior to leaving Chicago, where ^C had been going to school, he had
illegally accessed an AOL system belonging to Michigan Bell.  The system
operator broke in on him and ^C tried unsuccessfully to pass himself off as a
legitimate user.  When this did not work, he hung up and did not give it a
second thought.  Upon returning home to Detroit, he had a message waiting for
him to contact the sysop of the AOL system.  He calling him and they,
accompanied by Michigan Bell security, went out to lunch.  To avoid being
prosecuted, Control C had to give up all of the information he had on that
system and explain how he had gotten in.  Since he had cooperated, they let him
go without further hassle.  Unfortunately, Control C was soon busted again for
breaking into his Central Office, but this time he was not going to get off so
easily.  He had to agree to making a talk show movie and a poster (quoted in
the beginning of the article) for Michigan Bell.  Both of these items have been
distributed across the country to better illustrate the hacker mind-set and as
a reminder to destroy important documents that were being thrown away.

While being interrogated by Michigan Bell security department, Control C was
shown a list of recently busted hackers from the July 21, 1987 sweep of the
country.  On this list was Sir Francis Drake, which is how the rumor about SFD
being busted last year got started.  However, what Control C and Michigan Bell
did not know was that when Mark Gerardo was apprehended last year, he was
believed to be SFD and as such was entered in their files incorrectly.

                       Information Provided by Control C

     With a little help figuring out the SFD mixup from me and Taran King

North Dakota Nightmare                                       September 10, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
               "For Kracking Crue's Docs Avage The Game Is Over"

In March of 1987, the North Dakota members of Kracking Crue (Docs Avage and
SpyroGyra (also known as Ractor)) found a local extender and were able to hack
out a code.  They both lived on campus at North Dakota State University and
were able to abuse the code without the worry of being caught because of the
campus's Dimension phone system giving them a high degree of anonymity.

They used this code for the entire rest of the school year and nothing had
happened to prevent them from abusing it.  Because of this lack of security, DA
and SG began to believe that the code would be safe for them to use anywhere.
The school year ended and the members of the Crue went home.  Eventually the
Crue discovered a 1-800 number for the long distance service they had been
abusing and began to use it once again.  However, they were soon to discover
that they were not half as safe as they thought.

The LD company had indeed been watching that code, but could not do anything to
catch the Crue because of the Dimension system on NDSU campus.  Docs Avage
started to use the code from his apartment to call SpyroGyra and a few other
people and the company got his line tapped and kept a record of where all his
calls went to.

In Docs Avage's own words;

    "On July 27th, 1988, I arrived back at my apartment after spending a
     weekend with my parents at their home.  I found it rather interesting to
     discover three extra cars in the parking lot, one of which was a Dodge
     Diplomat.

     I walked into my apartment and discover two police detectives, two phone
     officials, and two "computer experts" blissfully dismantling my Apple and
     all my peripherals.  One of my roommates was handcuffed and seated in a
     chair and my other roommate was kept closely watched as he was sitting in
     the kitchen.  I was asked who I was, and read my rights.  I agreed to
     cooperate.  I was busted on a dialup.

     The dialup being the one I had hacked out several months before, and
     gotten quite greedy with it (ok, I overabused the darn thing).  In my
     apartment, I placed around a $1000 worth of calls with it.  I had made
     calls with it before, but not to that extent.

     I remained very cooperative, and talked to several phone security
     representatives, including those from AT&T and U.S. Sprint (I had a
     printout of 4 Sprint Codes, never had used them, just had them).  The
     phone security people are experts at adverse psychology, and I can
     successfully say that they did a very good job of scaring me.
     Nevertheless, I knew that they were trying to play with my brain, so it
     wasn't as bad as it could have been.

     My roommate had been charged with the same offense as myself, Class C
     Felony Theft of Services (max 5 years/$5000).  However, the only thing he
     contributed to the whole matter was the fact that the telephone account
     was in his name.  The charges were dropped against him.

     After almost two months of waiting, the sentence date came.  I plead
     guilty, playing on a deal that my lawyer had made with the state's
     attorney.  The sentence included restitution (which hasn't been determined
     yet).  The phone company is desparately trying to stick me with a large
     bill, for services that cannot be proven that I had anything to do with; a
     bill that could stretch up to $5000 (like hell if I'm paying that much),
     and a very nice little clause called Deferment of Imposition.  Basically,
     I remain on probation until I pay back the restitution, at that time I can
     go through hearings and prove that I haven't been involved in such
     activities as for what I was convicted and the charges will not be placed
     on my record.  For the time being however, it's turning out to be monthly
     payments with supervised probation.  Needless to say, I, Docs Avage is
     retired, at least as as retired as someone in my position can get."

Docs said that he had been looking to retire for some time and that this
incident was the final straw.  He also added that he was questioned about
Jester Sluggo, Phrack Inc., and the Legion of Doom.  He did not know anything.

Man Charged with "Infecting" Computers                             May 24, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fort Worth, Texas (AP) -- A 39-year-old computer programmer is being prosecuted
on felony charges of infecting his ex-employer's computers with an electronic
"virus," and face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.

Donald Gene Burleson faces a charge of "harmful access to a computer," and is
free on a $3,000 bond pending his July 11 trial.

Police described the electronic interference as a "massive deletion" of more
than 168,000 records of sales commissions for employees.

Burleson is thought to be the first person charged under the state law
prohibiting computer sabotage, which took effect Sept. 1, 1985, about three
weeks before the alleged incident, said Davis McCown, chief of the Tarrant
County district attorney's economic crimes division.

Jury Selection In First Virus Trial Begins                    September 6, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from the Washington Post (September 7, 1988),Page C-1

Fort Worth, Texas (AP) -- Jury selection began today in the criminal trial of a
40-year-old programmer accused of using a computer "virus" to sabotage
thousands of records at his former work place.  The trial is expected to last
about two weeks.

Donald G. Burleson faces up to 10 years in jail and a $5,000 fine if convicted
in the trial, a first for the computer industry.  Burleson was indicted on
charges of burglary and harmful access to a computer in connection with
computer damage at a securities firm, said Nell Garrison, clerk of the state
criminal district court in Fort Worth.  Through his lawyer, Jack Beech,
Burleson denies the charges but has declined further comment.

The firm has been awarded $12,000 in a civil lawsuit against Burleson.
Pretrial motions were scheduled to be heard today, followed by jury selection,
Garrison said.

Burleson is accused of planting a piece of computer software known as a virus
in the computer system at USPA&IRA Co. two days after he was fired.  A virus is
a computer program, often hidden in apparently normal computer software, that
instructs the computer to change or destroy information at a given time or
after a certain sequence of commands.  USPA officials claim Burleson went into
the company's offices one night and planted a virus in its computer records
that would wipe out sales commissions records every month.  The virus was
discovered two days later, after it had eliminated 168,000 records.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
White Lightning was apparently previously accused of being an informant for
Sprint Security with regard to information concerning The Disk Jockey and
Compaq.

He left the following message on the Phrack Voice Message System;

"Yeah, this is White Lightning.  I'd like to make an official statement for
 Phrack Magazine.  As far as what happened to The Disk Jockey, Shit, I have no
 idea, ok?  I get on a bridge, I've been out of it for two weeks, I get on
 Friday night, and fuck, this guy Laser outta 206 is saying I got him busted,
 I don't know anything about it, ok?  As far as Compaq goes, outta 219, Kent,
 I'd just appreciate it, your information is messed.. <BEEP!>  [The Phrack VMS
 has a beep that lets you know that you only have 10 seconds left.]  What the
 hell is that!?  Hello?!?  Who is that?!"

Message For White Lightning from Phrack Inc.;

    If you would care to explain your side of the story a little more clearly,
    we would be happy to listen to what you have to say.  We are sure that
    everyone would be interested.  Thank you.

AT&T Links Up With GTE                                           August 1, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AT&T is stepping up its efforts to boost revenues from telecommunications gear
by buying GTE's phone switch business.  AT&T will become the leading equipment
supplier to GTE's phone companies, which are the main source of the
switch operations $500 million in revenues.

AT&T will take a 49% stake in a new company that will comprise GTE's switch
manufacturing operations in Illinois and a research and development facility in
Phoenix, Arizona.  GTE, whose business employs 5,000, is counting on AT&T's
technical expertise to support its base of phone switching systems.  It also
wants out of the phone equipment business.  AT&T's main task; making the
switches capable of handling the massive voice and computer data transmission
requirements anticipated by GTE's phone companies over the next 15 years.

Neither partner disclosed financial terms of the joint venture.  But AT&T will
own 80% of it by 1993 and 100% by 2003.  Its management structure is not yet
decided.  GTE has made similar moves in recent years that have ended in giving
full management control and ownership to its partners.  Such deals include one
with West Germany's Siemens in communication transmission products and a second
with Japan's Fujitsu in office phone systems.

Is There A Doctor In The House?                                  August 1, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It all started when I met him on a bridge in Texas.  No one really understands
why he did it or why he chose that particular handle.  He seems to have some
decent knowledge and would not have had much trouble reaching a high level of
notoriety.  Unless there is more here than meets the eye.

                   Doc Holiday/Scott of 713 is an IMPOSTER!

He was doing a pretty good job pretending to be the original Doc Holiday.  He
had researched all about him, including details concerning his recent bust for
COSMOS abuse, and created a framing story to explain how and why he now was
Scott instead of Robbie and how his family had moved from Tennessee to Texas.
The majority of the phreak/hack community bought the story and he would have
gone on unseen except for the return of some folks who had disappeared last
fall; Knight Lightning and Taran King.  Upon hearing about this Doc Holiday in
713, they already suspected that he was bogus, and once they had spoken to him
they knew it was not the original Doc Holiday.  To bring a hilarious end to
this charade they waited until they could contact the original Doc Holiday to
let him in on the exposure.

As destiny would have it, the real Doc Holiday was on vacation and happened to
end up spending a weekend in St. Louis, the weekend right after SummerCon '88.
So the three of them got together started Scott Holiday talking to further
incriminate himself and then let the REAL Doc Holiday introduce himself and
have the last laugh.

Scott Holiday was in shock at first and he tried to explain that he had a good
reason for doing it, but his mom got on the phone and he had to go.

After this incident, I talked to him voice, and he explained to me that he
enjoyed doing this, and it was "the biggest scam" he had ever pulled off,
except that you could argue that he did not really pull it off.  Seeing as how
Scott is quite adept at the art of social engineering, he really had little to
no trouble convincing (for lack of a better word) people who did not know the
original Doc Holiday.  However when he came up against the best, he failed the
test miserably.

The point of publicizing this incident is to document that people can be easily
fooled and deceit by phone phreaks is not limited to the phone companies.  Keep
in mind that people are not necessarily whom they claim and in that lies the
greatest truth of all.

                        Information Provided By Epsilon

      Special thanks to Knight Lightning and Taran King for the exposure.

Canada Cancels The Underlord                                     August 3, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                "I still Hack!"

The Underlord awoke on February 11, 1988 at 7:30 AM to the sound of his
doorbell.  Moments later, his mother entered his room to inform him that there
were three men waiting to see him.  She had a rather puzzled look on her face.
He threw on some clothes and ran downstairs to meet his fate head on.  The "fat
man" showed him a search warrant and informed him that he was under arrest for
7 offenses.  They confiscated everything.

The Underlord was escorted to their car (his mother followed behind) and driven
off to the police station.  They told him something about cameras being all
over the station, but it did not matter to him because, "I wasn't going to kill
the guy or anything anyway."  From there he was taken to a little room, in
which he overheard the police playing with my computer, phone, and tapes that
they confiscated.

He had to sit there alone for four hours until his dad drove his home and later
showed his the papers.

"They said I was being charged for four counts of 'theft of telecommunications'
 (a real law in Canada), and three counts of mischief."

He was told that the mischief charges were because he called Emergency 911
(although he said he did it through a PBX) and told them obscenities with a
friend on three-way.

Practically six months later, on June 16, 1988, The Underlord finally received
everything back and went to court.  He had to pay $750.00 total and serve eight
months probation.  However, he only had the three counts of mischief on his
record.

He explained that in Canada, if the government wants to make you pay a fine,
they must prove that you have enough money to pay it first.  However, UL did
not and so the authorities said they would drop the charges if he would pay the
$750.00.

Teen Hackers Ring Up Huge Phone Bill                            October 7, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Robert Macy (Associated Press)

Las Vegas, Nevada - Ten teen-age hackers may have run up to $650,000 in
telephone calls by tricking phone company computers, and their parents could be
liable for the tab, authorities said.

Tom Spurlock, resident agent-in-charge of the Las Vegas Secret Service office,
said the teen-agers engaged in Blue Boxing, a technique that enabled them to
talk to fellow hackers throughout Europe.

The teen-agers were not taken into custody or charged, but their computers were
seized.  Spurlock said it will be up to AT&T to decide whether to seek
reimbursement once a final tally is obtained.

Virus Hits Unix at Bell Labs                                       May 13, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Friday the 13th, a devastating virus hit Bell Labs at Murray Hill.  Initial
reports from survivors indicate that the destruction caused was very
widespread, although limited to Sun workstations.  Rumor has it that the virus
was planted by a disgruntled Sun employee in the Sun Unix kernel.  The actual
amount of work lost is unknown, as is the Murray Hill policies on frequency of
disk backups.

"Hacker" Free Again
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the heads of the Hamburg CCC, S. Wernery, was released from jail in
Paris.  The 26-year-old arrived at Hamburg airport yesterday (whenever that
was, there was no date on the article).  He stated the accusations against him
were still being investigated.  After having been questioned by a judge he was
released from bail, but has to return to Paris at request, though.
