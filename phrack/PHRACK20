                     Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue XX Index
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Welcome to Phrack XX, the end of the old and beginning of the new.  The
original hard luck heroes are back from retirement (or are they?).  Originally,
this was going to be an issue put out by Crimson Death to show what the end of
Metal Shop Private was all about as well as to end the association of Metal
Shop with Phrack Inc., but things just didn't seem to quite happen that way.
As of today, October 12, 1988, Knight Lightning and Taran King are once again
the chief editors of Phrack Inc. with the help of Epsilon and The Prophet.
     This particular issue is dedicated to Metal Shop Private.  Most of the
files, with the exception of this Index, the Phrack Pro-Phile on Taran King,
the Timeline, and Phrack World News XX, all files contain the contents of Metal
Shop Private as of the day it went down with a few exceptions.  Because of the
"Days until deletion" function, many of the messages were lost when we ran the
board again.  Most, if not all, subboards were filled close to the 100 message
mark.  We apologize for not being clever enough to predict the results of
running the program after such a long time, but you should get a good idea of
what went on within the domain of Metal Shop Private.  We hope you enjoy it,
and be watching soon for Phrack XXI.  Good to be back!

         Welcome to the Phrack Pro-Phile XX.  Phrack Pro-Phile was created
to bring info to you, the users, about old or highly important/controversial
people.  This month, I bring to you someone who you all have seen and heard
of...

                                  Taran King
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~
                                    (me!)

         Taran King (I) was the sysop of Metal Shop Private, a private
exchange for telecommunications enthusiasts (phone phreaks and hackers) as
well as being the home-base of Phrack Inc. which I ran.  I also had a hand in
the organization of SummerCon '87 and PartyCon '87.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         I started out in the BBS world in September of 1983 when a friend
gave me numbers to different modems which included things to hack on as well
as bulletin boards.  I actually got my computer in late June of that year, but
didn't understand the concept of the modem until that point. I got involved
with David Lightman (314)'s board before it went up by beta-testing it for him
at times and when he put it up, I ended up being user 2 and then soon after,
co-sysop of The Dark Tower.  It was there that my local notariety became
strong and a few people from the nation started calling in.  His board was
very good with what he had and the little advertising that it got, but it
eventually went down.  It was at that point when I started getting around
nationally and was able to make connections of my own.  I put up Metal Shop:
The Dark Tower Phase II a bit after because St. Louis totally lacked bulletin
boards that dealt with hacking or phreaking.  I advertised around the country
and drew in quite a crowd.  The board excelled with time to the point of
having around 500 users when it got to be a security risk in my eyes and we
put in the general password system (made by Cheap Shades, of course).
Eventually, that crowd got weeded down to a lot fewer people and some time
after that, I was hospitalized.  After my release from the hospital, Cheap
Shades and I (me on the ideas and Shades on the programming) created a
modified version of WWIV BBS program to suit my wants/needs and it resembled
the old Shop set-up.  As time went on, it became a name of its own through the
crowd that hung out on it as well as having Phrack Inc. as being based there.
For more detailed explainations of how things came about and about a few
things mentioned above, see the big history file in this issue of Phrack Inc.
I've met a few members of the phreak/hack world including the following:
Knight Lightning, Cheap Shades, Forest Ranger, The W(hack)o Cracko Bros., Dr.
Forbin, Data Line, and Reverend Enge (all local to me), as well as Jester
Sluggo, Blue Buccaneer, Phantom Phreaker, Doom Prophet, Bill from RNOC, Tuc,
Dan The Operator, Lex Luthor, The Leftist, Sir Francis Drake, Loki, Disk
Jockey, Control C, Synthetic Slug, Lucifer 666, Mad Hatter, Cutthroat, The Mad
Hacker (219), Sir William, Dr. Cypher, Hatchet Molly, Bad Subscript, The
Mentor, Cisban Evil Priest, Phrozen Ghost, Surfer Bob, Crimson Death (618), The
Dictator, Doc Holiday (901), and The Ur-Vile.  Some of the memorable phreak
boards I was on (besides my own) included The Dark Tower, The Pipeline,
Broadway Show, Zyolog, Stronghold East Elite, Stronghold North, Hell Phrozen
Over, Private Sector, Pirate-80, Stalag 13, Lunatic Labs UnLtd., Quick Shop,
Metal Shop Brewery, NetSys, The Private Connection, ShadowSpawn, RACS III, The
Pearly Gates, Brainstorm Elite, Metalland North, The Alliance, Intergalactic
Dismantling, Inc. (IDI), DUNE, Speed Demon Elite, The Abyss, MetroMedia/Danger
Zone Private, The Matrix, Thieve's World, FreeWorld II, Flying Circus, Twilight
Zone, Septic Tank, The Lost City of Atlantis, Phantasie Realm, CHAMAS, and
probably a few others I forgot that were important. Certain knowledge I've
gained over the years is attributed to various boards forementioned as well as
people like Bill from RNOC, Phantom Phreaker, Doom Prophet, The Videosmith, and
many others not to mention reading (a key part to learning technical things)
and social engineering.

         I utterly hate working with computers for anything other than
communicating with friends and occasionally word processing.  Programming on
them is the most repugnant thought in the world to me (no offense Shades!).

         I've really never been much for hacking at all, although I did gain a
bit of an interest through the legitimate accounts I gained on systems such as
NetSys run by Terminus in Maryland.  Hacking was never really much for me
(besides looking at things on dull systems that were totally useless) when I
first got the modem.  Now that I'm at college and have access to it, I'm
learning VM/CMS a bit so that I can use Bitnet and work through/with it.

         I attended and had a part in organizing both SummerCon '87 and
PartyCon '87 (very much in SummerCon and very little in PartyCon).  I also
attended SummerCon '88 for a little while on each of the days except Sunday. I
was supposed to be on the NEW TAP staff, run by the W(hack)o Cracko Bros. as
well as being on the staff of Telecomputist (which sponsored SummerCon '87) and
doing all but writing articles for Phrack Inc.  Other than that, I'm not
terribly involved with phreaker/hacker media.

         The only group I was ever in was The 2600 Club! which later revised
into The NEW 2600 Club! which was just as ignorant with more interesting names
but about an equal participation in anything.  I learned I was able to advance
through the phreak world without the booster of a club besides using my board
as a reference.  I didn't need to rely on the work of others.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Interests: Telecommunications (basically phreaking knowledge-wise
                   now), music (heavy metal of all sorts plus so much more
                   and playing electric guitar), fraternity life (party), women
                   (white ones, blond, with blue eyes, and NO FAT CHICKS!
                   Namely, Kimberly), driving (and one day, I'll drive that
                   fucking DeLorean!)

Taran's Favorite Things
-----------------------

        Women: Kimberly (see above...I went all out!)
         Cars: Lamborghini Contachs, DeLoreans, Lotuses, Vectors, etc.
        Foods: NO VEGETABLES!
        Music: Heavy metal, Pink Floyd, classic rock.
      Leisure: Partying, playing guitar, spending time with the woman.
Alcoholic fun: Tequila shots, Rum & Coke, good beer (pretty much anything),
               Long Island Tea, and those funky teas you find at college
               parties in garbage cans lined with garbage bags (hmm!)

Most Memorable Experiences
--------------------------

Forest Ranger's conferences (what would YOU do for a Klondike Bar at 3am?).
Car accident with Jester Sluggo as well as almost a 2nd time afterwards (keep
         drinking!).
Bell Shock Force conferences (yes ma'am, I'm sorry but you'll just have to cut
         those wires)
Getting busted in late May '87 (don't try it, it ain't fun).
SummerCon '87 (a better party than PartyCon '87, met a lot of great people).
PartyCon '87 (a lot of fun, but too unorganized although I met a few more
         people that I had wanted to).
SummerCon '88 (wait, did I attend that???).


Some People to Mention
----------------------

Knight Lightning (my right hand man; although he wasn't terribly
         knowledgeable, he was always there and trying to help out and still
         is!|)
David Lightman 314 (for allowing me to use his program to start what turned
         out to be Metal Shop Private)
Man-Tooth (my original 2nd co-sysop next to KL who drove me down to David
         Lightman's house in South-fucking-County St. Louis for 30 minutes)
Dr. Forbin/Mr. Modem (for re-transferring the original program after something
         got fucked after the ride to South-fucking-County)
Forest Ranger (wild man, can't say much about him without getting hurt|)
Phantom Phreaker (we found ya for 2600 Club and you excelled far beyond any of
         the rest of us in the club did, plus you helped my board immensely)
Barbie Doll (for suggesting the idea of Phrack Inc. in different words even if
         nobody knows what or who you were or where you were from)
The W(hack)o Cracko Bros. (what a couple of idiots)
Oryan Quest (never has there been as bad a pest as this man, but he turned out
         to be human Mexican, but human| after we were both busted,
         interestingly enough)
Lex Luthor (for freaking me out when he first called my board and contributing
         a bit here and there)
Capt. Hook (taught me a bit about social engineering here and there and
         introduced me to a few people as well as helping out a couple of
         times)
Cheap Shades (what would Metal Shop have been without the programming mastery
         of this individual; my left hand man and great friend as well)
Tuc (generally a good friend and historical reference as well as creating the
         Pro-Phile that I based the rest of them on)
Bill from RNOC (another one of my best friends who is the smartest person
         potentially, and definitely the smartest when it comes to phreaking
         and hacking put together; a great source of information, and one of
         the most hilarious people I know)
Olorin The White (if this guy puts me in his group one more time, I'm gonna
         kill him!)

         I'm against pretty much all forms of fraud now that I've spent the
night in jail, the summer of '87 in pain and waiting, and will spend the next 3
years of my life on probation.  I'm not informing to anyone about anything if
you have thoughts about that statement, but I have no part in anything
fraudulent. I've always thought that carding was the most stupid crime
connected with computers and that it's too risky to be worth it in the end.  I
hope that the future phreaks and hackers keep around and retain what's been
built up over the many years since long before I'd heard of phreaking or
hacking.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope you enjoyed this file.  Although I had at one time intended on this
being my last Pro-Phile, it's actually the first of many to come...And now
for the regularly taken poll from all interviewees.

Of the general population of phreaks you have met, would you consider most
phreaks, if any, to be computer geeks?  Generally, the cool ones aren't, but
of course, in every large group of people, you'll probably find a few geeks
here and there.  Thanks for your time, Randy.  No problem, Randy.

Well, that's pretty much all of what was on the board for the most part.  There
were a few more things like the format on the upper part of the screen which
was windowed off from what was happening on the board which contained the
on-line user's information and other things only the sysop would see, but
nothing about it was too interesting.  I hope you enjoyed seeing all of the
things contained on what used to be my board, and I hope you were both suprised
and let down at the same time.  That's the way it should be because it was, as
I so often said, over-rated.  Anyway, I'd like to acknowledge the fact that
both Control C and The Mad Hacker were going to run Metal Shop Private after my
problems arose, but Control C had some problems of his own and after he got the
program, he lost it and The Mad Hacker would have run it, but I received notice
about something concerning the board which convinced me to keep it down
forever.  It's all still intact like I said, but it's probably just going to
sit on my hard drive until my father needs more room on the hard drive for
Lotus 1-2-3 or something and it'll get formatted over.

Oh, one last note:  For those of you who thought you were hackers and attempted
to get my password (which never happened in the history of the board), it was
"ME?CRAZY", my phone number was MSP-314-SLAY, and the secondary password
necessary to log on as a sysop remotely was "LASHING."

 Hey, I got the same two posters with the exception of one thing, They say
Spring Break '87 - Daytona Beach. Anyhow, My Easter Sunday went pretty well, I
awoke at about 10am with the sun streaming through the window and trying to
make its way through the beer tower. I rolled over to the sound of the ocean
waves hitting the coast. I got up opened one of last nights beers and walked
out onto the balcony intern seeing a great view of Daytona Beach.  The rest of
the day went pretty much the same way.

purposeful subboard idea that you'd like for a specific group or group of
people or project, do leave feedback and we'll see what we can do.  How' s that

   Sounds good to me. Too bad there are not that many people into Primos
(sigh). I can just see it now: "Unix Hacking - Subop: Solid State."

   Crax and I were talking about scams today and we came across an interesting
topic. It seems that if someone orders something to you in your name (that you
didnt pay for) you can keep it, unless the company decides to pay for its
return or gets it back theirselves. I can understand that most people are not
going to pay to have something shipped back to a company but the idea of
"keeping it" doesnt sound right. Comments?

I have been getting an occasional bad connection too, and I am local to MSP.
What could be causing this?  I had a hum on my phone line a while back and I
had Bell check it out and run some line check stuff and then it went away,
perhaps Taran should do the same.

Name: Evil Jay 26

   Anyway, my connections to MSP are just fine. The only board I have problems
with is Phantasie Realm.

   Have a question for anyone who grows dope. Someone told me that the pigs
have some kind of radar that they use when flying over the woods, fields..etc,
that supposedly pick up plants that are growing less than two feet from each
other. I dont see how this is possibly at all, but its kind of scary. Also, can
anyone give me some good ideas on how to grow it. I already have about 50
planted that are coming up quite well (Im in the money...!) and I use that shit
they put on fields for fertilizer. I also germinate my seeds by putting them in
wet paper towels in a dark place for a few days before planting them (sprouts
up), about 2 inchs deep in garden soil (that shit you buy at k-mart thats
supposed to be good dirt). That was a lame question, but I need to know...

   Speaking of Phantasie Realm, we changed the format for the last time and it
looks good. New advanced subs, killed all the assholes, lowe red the access of
all the non-contributers, got plenty of files/space, and lots of msgs and
discussions. Feel free to call and post the  around:

 The plane radar idea could have some truth to it. I mean it is very possible .
They use planes to control our traffic speed also.

 I'm sure you have all seen those depth finder things on boats and stuff. Those
things can tell you almost exactly whats underneath. Probably the same type of
gadget the plane would use.  Sounds possible to me.

12/100: Knowing
Name: Doom Prophet 21

Knowing the cops, they probably do have things like that, so they can go out
and waste more money in the name of stupid bandwagoning tactics a la Ron and
Nancy Reagan, William Bennett, Rehnquest and O'Connor (the latter two were
appointed Supreme Court justices, screened by Ronald Reagan and Edwin Meese to
make sure they were conservative and conformist enough to the rest of the
senile warmonger's administration). Mor e and more money is being wasted in the
name of their fucking law and order, their fucking 'Christianity', self
righteousness, conservative viewpoints that deny people's civil rights (womens
right to an Abortion, Roe Vs Wade decision, the firing of 1/2 of the Civil
Rights Commission and probably replacing them with Reagan Lovers, and more).
Now the cops will go to exteme lengths (this radar shit and Paraquat poisoning)
to make sure that they can have their fucking recreational drugs which are
perfectly legal while condemning us as criminals for engaging in other
recreational drugs that are less harmful (but ILLEGAL of course, it makes all
the difference. Laws are always right and fair, and manipulative enough by
those in power as a small child would play with Ronald Reagan's shit, smearing
it over the constitution). I can see them also having orgasms and myocardial
infarctions when they find plants they think are cannibussativa, only to find
out they are sewer weeds, things growing from flowing human waste in fields.

Date: 4:15 am  Sat May 02, 1987

I kind of find the radar idea a bit spaced out... After all, if it picked up
pot plants less than 2 feet apart, it would pick up damned near every thing
else less than 2 feet apart. In decent sized forest, this could amount to
quite a bit of garbage... weeds, small trees, etc. The police DO ariel
searches, but I believe (though I'm not sure) that they do it by sight.

They usually do this, though, over state- and company- owned land, as most
dope-farmers, for some reason, don't own their own forest land. I know for a
fact that in my area, they do occasional air searches over some forest land
owned by a paper company, but they don't search the forest behind my house
owned by my grandfather (otherwise I would be in or under a jail cell now).

The guy (Prophet) is really right on this one...I've never heard of such crazy
shit as police radar picking up plants that are 2 feet apart! And he's going to
grow the stuff thinking shit like this (?).  The one thing to be careful of are
pirhanas (people who at harvest time go looking for huge fields of pot).

You don't have to use fertilizer, but the pot will be weak if it's
undernourished. Another thing to remember is not to({use too much fertilizer.
Actually, marijuana is a pretty tough plant, and doesn't really require a
great deal of care. Just water them daily, and plant them somewhere where they
can get plenty of sunlight.

This is bullshit, what is going on here!?  Next thing you know we will have a
subboard called "Better Drugs And Gardens."

First of all this police drug radar is the most amazing piece of trash gossip I
have ever heard.  Police would have better things to do than go through back
yards with plant radar.  I mean any two objects within 2 feet of each other set
it off... yeah right.  What about patio furniture, what about a backyard grill
and gas tank?  What about shrubs or trees?

Whoever came up with this one must have been ON DRUGS himself at the time.

Although it does sound 99.99% wrong, that's just the sort of thing the cops
would come up with to act as a deterrent against life. EEEGg.

Two notes of addt'l interest:

-:1- In Virgina Beach, home of the 700 club, it is illegal to imbibe alcohol
     outdoors. So, if someone was having a beer in his fenced in yard, someone
     else could call the cops and say "There's a man drinking beer in his
     backyard.  Please hurry!" and the cops could come and cart him away.

-:2- The latest issue of OMNI has a very fascinating article about the US.
     Military and how they are linked with US communications services (or would
     like to be). Needless to say, you should read it.

-:3- OK, so I forgot one (or I can't count. You be the judge). The latest
     issue of RIP  is the Rock Censorship Issue, and has even MORE fascinating
     articles on the PMRC, the Back In Control punk/metal deprogramming center,
     and much much more. Again, you should read it.

Everytime I read something like this, I go out to the fields and have a
dandelion break. I can't believe stuff like this can happen in America.

Well, I find it very hard to believe that someone could detect such plants
growing so closely together. Secondly, for the outdoor Dope Grower, Simply,
bury some seeds and forget them for a few months. If You plan on indoor
growing, You have to understand that Dope is a Weed, so that they don't really
need sunlight, and would grow in virtually any environment. If you want an
indoor garden, spend a few bucks and get a hydrpod setup(Articles in
High-Times) and buy a "Grow and Show" light. I have heard that if you crush up
Quaaludes and use them as fertalizer, you will come out with some heavy dope.

Just remember that germination is a BIG key in getting something decent. Yes, I
have grown some in my basement, it wasn't THAT good, but the price was
right.....

Cannabis (sp?) is a weed and can grow anywhere.  However for the best potency,
good sunlight, water, and fertilizer is needed.  Soaking the seeds for a few
days in drenched paper is good before planting, just to get the sprouts going.

I don't know about that plant detection nonsense, but I do know that you can
get capital punishment for selling pot in school. (Thanks Nancy, you
dragon-witch)

The other day, I read on the back of a coffee can, "Say no to drugs." What
hypocrosy, no? Caffeine is a much more abused drug and more addictive
(according to many sources), than a pure 100% natural bowl of grade-a herb.
Everything is a drug in America:Nicotene, caffeine, money, power, etc.. (uh

Considering police radar detects the speed of moving objects, the same

just if something is moving, thats why radar detectors often go off around
stores, I dont know how it would detect plants two feet apart.  What do they
set the PSD plant spacing detector to 2 feet?  Or do the plants run around
when noone is looking?

Does a tree that falls in a forest with noone to hear it or record it mae any
noise?

Why can you see?

this dope issue.. first of all, yes, it can be detected by its ir signature,
thats so expensive, and time consuming though. Usually what they did where I
was living was just cruise over the mountians/wooded areas, and If youveever
seen a pot plant, usually the color gives them away.. I have 12 plants in my
closet, each about 1' 1/2" tall, which I have had 1 1/2 months... Use miracle
gro fertilizer. this is best, because it wont burn the plants, as you cannot
use too much.. also, you definetly dont want to get males and females mixed
up. the females will have a short growth at the bottom of the stem as they
mature, which, when broken off will grow right back where it was. I have heard
of people grafting hops onto plants, and this served an excellent disguise,
but where can ya get hops??

Around here the skaters are mostly dicks they think they are cool because they

 I'm concerned for our countries future. Right-wingers and conservatives are
fucking up everything, I'm so sick of hearing about their bullshit,
cencorship, and the like. Some right winger said something along the lines of
'When a student picks up a math book, he reads that there are no absolutes.
The next thing you know, he turns to crime and drugs.'

 Now, that takes the cake for being the most foolish, scatterbrained, lame
attempt to support your views. But, they have the money, funded by Falwell and
Robertson, who dupe consumers into sending them money so they will 'go to
heaven' and have 'the lord's blessing'.  'Most people are assholes' (name of a

crime is cool, and so is drugs. (This supports my earlier paragraph)

Anyone who wants to know where the country's heading in the future need do
nothing more than look at the heart of the Southern Baptist Bible Belt, North

Well, who knows. I'm sure there will always be good phreaks around. I will be
doing less of course (Graduation, College, Work, etc) but that's no big loss.

About political classifications, I liked the Nolan chart much better than
traditional Left-Right wing grouping. Most people take left to mean communist
and opposed to personal freedom. Some of the more famous left wing (radicals)
are the Black Panthers from the late sixties, and others that I won't mention.
Right wing conservative policies generally seem to be more realistic (but of
course because they side with the current system and don't support radical
change as left wing does). I think we do need change to prevent America from
becoming a cesspool of violence, money, racism, and exploitation of both
people and the environment (it's like that now though depending upon your
viewpoint). It's a difficult question, because the root of the system is
people-people with stubborn entrenched attitudes. How are we going to change
the entire system if we can't change ourselves and others around us? Impose a
law? That would be fascist. In my opinion, freedom of expression and action
should be allowed so long as it's not causing harm or violence toward the
innocent (or the not so innocent). The Libertarian party summed it up quite
well..but a political party doesn't make a perfect system.
To change the topic slightly, what do you feel about our actions (fraud,
breaking and entering, etc) as far as morality (flexible and sometimes useless
term) and justice? (That sounds corny but I don't know how else to word it).

Yeah well, what I was trying to say is that with college in the fall and the
quite often occurence of 950 blocking from college campuses, a new area to have
to scan for Telenet dialups or whatever and in general, I fell that as a
whole, the phreak community will suffer greatly.  Lets face it, there will
continue to be a phreak community, but as I see it, today's phreaks,
specifically those on this system or Catch have reached the highest plateau in
the area of knowledge ever in the history of our community.  This is not to
say that it will never be surpassed, but somehow with more and more security
involving itself in our affairs and the decline of interest I feel that this
is the golden age and it will start to fall back until a new era begins many
years from now.

The community will continue to exist no matter what, even if for no better
reason than the rodent wares kids or the habitual code abusers.

As far as morality, I don't feel too concerned about it although I do believe
it to be wrong.  I try not to think about it too much.  However, when the
government or Reagan can make deals with terrorist and lose millions of
dollars or throw it away, I don't feel to guilty about making illegal calls.
Its all in how you rationalize it.

Gee....isn't speeding illigal too?  Like you said, it's all relative, but can
you remember making your first code call?  It's like you hang up, and your
waiting for the phone to ring with someone saying "Your busted......"  I guess
its all a form of de-sensitizing, after a while, you really ignore or don't
realize the extent of the illigal-ness of the activity that you are doing.

KL-I'm still working on that "Laws of preaking....." stuff that we talked
about, while reading over old notes, etc, it can make you realize what you are
"up against" if you are caught.  Basically, your screwed if an adult.  For the
most part you are seeing about 30 days jail time, full restitution, and
assorted court costs.  Not a good time.   I was wasted a few nights ago and
debated calling up a LD company and telling them that I had hacked EVERY code
they had, and would sell them the code file for $1000, else turn the file
public.  Wonder what they would do?  I sure wouldn't want to be the one at the
bank cashing the check, extorsion (sp?) is pretty big time stuff....

    Face it folks. Were heading down the long road to communism. Our leaders
are pretty much all corrupt. I think our country stinks. And I think in a
few years the "kiddies" will feel the same. Face it, we talk about anti-drug
bullshit, and all this anti-that and anti-this, but our leaders are setting
a great example to the future leaders of our country, arent they? This country
is headed anywhere but uphill, and I hope I die before it all falls to
peices. Im old enough to vote, but chose not to and never will. I dont care
about politics even though I should. Id rather not take a small part in the
downfall of the good ole US of A. I dont follow politics, and I dont watch

..(sorry, double cr) the news. Why? Because its all BAD thats why. Anyway, I
hope to enjoy my life to the fullest without worrying about stupid shit, like
Reagan and his scams. One thing that does piss me off is this big drug war.
Its alot of nonsense if you ask me. The people that end up fucking up there
lives are the people who have no sense and get burnt on heavy drugs (Coke,
LSD...etc) and they end up either dead, dying, fucked up or trying to
rebuild there lives. Needless to say, they forgot about having a good time.
They got addicted. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Cmon folks, wake up...whats life
about? Having a good time and living the fullest and richest (I sound like
an ad for Folgers) life you possibly can Killing yourself isnt the
answer. I know, Im rambling on. Oh well. About this phreak war thing, we
all know its bullshit. Ifthe phreaks did unite (something pretty much
impossible - will never happen), who do you think would win? The government
or the phreaks? Even if we didnt get caught, we would still lose. The
puppet-masters have our senile president right where they want him, and
no matter who does what, they can keep them there for as long as they
wish. (At least til the end of his term, anyway). Its a suicide mission.
It cant be won. No one will ever be powerful enough to take on our government.
No one but non-americans would aid him, and theres too many people afraid
of the "bomb" for that too happen. So all we could do is piss them off, thus
giving them an even better reason to exterminate us all. Anyway, thats about
all I have to say on the matter(s).

Sure Im for the American Way. Its the people who are trying to fuck it
up for all of us that I dont like...

Name: Lex Luthor 36
Date: 10:02 am  Fri May 15, 1987

Getting back to that "golden age" deal, well I am sure there will be a time
when more and more things will be networked, but saying they will have all this
security and tracing shit is ridiculous. There will always be bugs and holes to
be exploited, and security always comes last for everything. The only people
who think security should come first are the ones whose job is security. Making
products, consulting, etc. Everyone else puts security low on the list. It will
probably remain that way indefinitely. Look at the show Max Headroom. I think
it is one of the best shows on TV. A lot of people don't like it. They don't
understand it. Sure some things are a bit ridiculous like the old-style
typewriter keys used for computer keyboards, but basically the show is quite
interesting. It appears that just about everything in existance is networked in
some way to some central processor. Every building, and everything within those
buildings are networked. Ang gaining access to the network, allows you to gain
access to just about anything, assuming you can defeat any security involved. I
like the show mainly due to the security and insecurity involved. They are
constantly breaking the security on everything.

The show probably is based on some variation of the future, and it does show
that no matter how sophisticated things get, there always will be ways around
it. Having the ability to defeat these controls, allows you to have control
over your own destiny as far as concepts of 'big brother' are concerned.

If the government turned into the big brother depicted in 1984, I am sure
those "good enough" would not be as affected. They would simply find ways to
get around controls and modify or neutralize anything that was threating to
them.

Since everyone has been rambling, I thought I would ramble some too.

I also have to disagree with your first comment.  Just because everyone is
going to college does not mean we will loose that many people.  When I left
about 2 years ago, I still tried to call here as much as I could.  Taran (or
Knight) did bring up a good point about college systems getting smarter but if
you go to a college that is good enough to have phones in each of the dorms (or
if you live in an apartment) then most of the time you don't have a thing to
worry about.

Actually, the idea of losing people due to college was KL's postulate... and I
basicaly agree with it.  Sure some people will keep being involved but most
wont have the time, equipment, and the fact that they will no longer be treated
as a minor by the law will act as a detriment.  (no that sentence wasnt
constructed right...)

Yow Lex...Cyberpunk for ever...Speaking of which (this belongs on the phrack

managed to interview William Gibson, author of Neuromancer & Count Zero, about

Ok, me and Bill are here right now on my 3-way with the 0perator.  We had her
connect us to 314-070-1000.  Bill said that he was priveledged and that he had
to speak to his brother in the post office.  When we thought the 0perator had
left the line, Bill proceded to simulate an 800 DA ring with his lips. When the
operator came on, he asked for the first company with Banana in its name and we
were given Banana Educational Software and cracked up.  We were hooked up to a
recording.  After the recording said 800-328, the operator came on and said she
was reporting this line.  She said she has had previous accounts... The
operator then paused and said, "Yes, yes I'd like a trace.  The number is
314-432-0756, good you traced it."  She then proceeded to access another loop
and keep us on hold for several minutes.  Oh, forgot a part.  After she finally
consented to connect the number, Bill said that she could go, and she says,
"No, I want to hear this!" and then she became silent until she started being
rude and decided that she was working for the FBI and set up a trace.

ANYWAY, after being put on hold for a few minutes, she came back and we
requested the supervisor and she wouldn't give her to us.  We eventually got
dropped.  We couldn't even file a complaint because we didn't have her fargin'
name.  I say we kill her.  I say we hang her, then we kill her.  I say we
tattoo her, then we scorch her, then we hang her, and THEN we kill her.

Yes that is correct, as many of us get older, the laws surrounding us are due
to change will will affect our outlook as to just how important the phreak/hack
community really is to us.  Some of the people that feel threatened may start
paying for calls rather than phreak, but this then gets expensive.

Furthermore, in college, there is most liklely little time for this.  Now Lex
may disagree becuase his exsperience may be a bit differenet, but he also takes
anout a month or more off between calls here.  In reference to Cheap Shades, he
ran Metal Shop AE here in StL.  Then off to college, he brought the computer
and put up QuickShop.  However, he had little time to use it and the necesssity
to use his only voice line (the bbs line) came up more and more often.
Eventually he just took it down and he doesn't call anywhere.

I said that the class of 87 going to college would harm the phreak world, not
destroy it and I still hold that opinion.

made that up recently). I followed it in the papers also, it was interesting
to see something like that happen. The CIA have not stopped with Nicaragua,
but now we have dragged Honduras, Mexico, Isreal, and other countries in our
feud with the Sandinistas, along with CIA/DEA dealings involving drug smuggling
to fund the Contras.

While we're on this topic, I just read an article in  Reader's Digest that
basically called the nuke freeze movement communist and corruptive. He had
some good points however, which only goes to show that both the U.S. and Russia
are at fault in certain situations. The test ban breaking by Ronn ie was shitty

captain just didn't switch from automatic to manual soon enough to shoot
anything.  Thirdly, the plane was American made and the missle was French

underplayed in the very same news we were brainwashed with. A lot of papers and
news media is owned by large corporations. Do you want the businesses that
caused an invasion of Cuba in this century to put thoughts into your head? So
the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 79. But of equal tyranny was thte U.S.
foreign policy toward Cuba (since our business is threatened by Castro we will
make war and the excuse will bbe we were fighting communism) earlier on. So
both of the superpowers suck. Now we have to support another war. How long
will it be before we are having Blood and Guts rambozos like Ollie North

that point you can kill it, and for the rest of the game, nothi ng will shoot

over the years (tempest, defender etc)..  although i don't spend too much time
playing them, i like hearing about these things. anyone give a hoot, or shall

I prefer pinball since most videogames are too slow for me. Pinball can be

Most people know that on Defender after you reach 990,000 every thing you hit
gies you a free guy up until 1 million when it "rolls over" to 0 again. You
don't receive new guys again until the last of your men are used up. It is
recommened to not use that many smart bombs during this time and let the guys
die. If you can get to a million then you should never have to worry about not
being able to get free men. Personally I think defender is one of the best
games of all time, since it has all the action I need. Asteroids Deluxe, the
hard one is a good game, just you can't find it anymore.

 and Gauntlet II are two very good games if you have 4 people that know how to
play the thing.  Galaga is a very good game, but my personal favorite is Qix,
yes, I know thats sad, but hey...

 On that Stark thing, the reason they didnt have that defense system on auto is
as follows.  First of all it uses extremely hig density lugs weighing 30 lbs
and shoots 3,000 a minute.  It uses radar to track the thing in and just blasts
the shit out of it.  The problem is, anything of any decent size with radar
would get the shit blown out of it, its not selective.  I dont think it would
be too nice to be coming in in a little helicopter (sp?) and have this thing
shoot 3000 rounds a min at you.  Something like that could ruin your day...

  The Exocet the missle that hit them| travels several hunderd miles an hour at
a distance of 8 feet from the water.  Neithers the AWACS nor the ship detected
the launch on radar, although the ship detected Radar Lock always a sign of
agression.  They did not know the thing was coming till they spotted it
visually.  By the time word got to the Information Center, they had 7 seconds
to respond... oh well...

98/100: tempest and things..
Name: Kerrang Khan 34
Date: 12:37 pm  Mon Jun 01, 1987

the low down on tempest -

first you have to play normally until you reach the red V shaped level.
when you reach the one after that (a square-ish V) you can die or (read
on)

you have to get a score over 170,000 for this bug to work (the red V's bonus is
something like 180k so its easier to just die and play a new game.  in order to
get 170k+ on one quarter requires you get up into the yellow levels which is
kind of tough).  anyway, once you have 170,000 plus point the key is to get the
last two digits of your score to a specific number and then just die.  you can
jump your score by two points by shooting 'spikes' and by one point for
finishing off a spike (you work it out).

some interesting two digit numbers are

12, 17 - 40 free credits
05     - dumps you into playing the attract mode (more on this)
00     - freeze game in attract mode
01     - reset game (puts you into the maint. screen)
46     - changes level you can start at.
48     - lots and lots of 'ships' (mode on this too).

you set up your score and die, then wait for the game to cycle through
the attract mode, and then things will happen.  17 just starts adding credits
and you can play normally, but you can have much more fun with 05. this just
dumps you into the game tempest will be playing with itself. at this point, ALL
the strange things you can trigger off will go on while you are playing.  if
you can hit 48 your ships will start multiplying, up to about 255 (guess), and
if you can do this, you hit 01 and wait after which your game will 'normalize'
and you can play all day to some outrageous high score.  if you hit 00 though,
the xDgame will freeze up on you.  anyway thats a rough outline, and it only
works on older versions. how did you get your own tempest machine DJ?

  k

highspeed isnt a game, its a way of life.

then when they all drank large amounts of beer, it was realised "Hey! These

I'm glad that someone has a dissenting opinion on the drinking scene. While I
do like to drink (on an average of about maybe 1 or 2 times a month, unless
parents are gone or something), I also think that bragging about drugs and
alky takes/shows no intelligence, and the person who refrains from doing that
is a non-conformist. A bunch of people at my school call me 'the Anti-Pot
Crusader' and similar names because I dislike hearing about how fucking drunk
and stoned, etc, everyone got over the weekend for 2 hours straight. But tht
doesn't mean I think it's wrong (unless someone is abusing, etc, selling shitt
to buy drugs). You could take myy messsage as being a 'conformist' drinking/etc

Oh, ok Randy, you can sleep in the same room with Broadway.  Don't bend over

Forest Ranger did make some comments and so did Taran on Atlantis.  We have to
remember the saftey of the people going and without sounding crude, the
question of Broadway's sexual preference has never been answered conclusively.
There are several people who plan to attend that would be very concerned about
their personal well-being if they were forced to room with Broadway and I think
that it would just make things simpler if B-way grabbed his own room.

If the guy shows up, then he shows up.  You can't make plans around him.

As for partying, if you wanna get smashed drunk and make a fool out of
yourself, go ahead.  I'll drink, but drink moderately (about 6 beers/Hour).
As for trading info, or getting busted; DON'T bring anything REAL illegeal.
Others have said this, and I hope that nobody blows it for the rest of us.

About the drinking age: as long as you stay in the damn room and drink, and
keep somewhat quiet, there should be very little of a problem.  For buying
booze, I should be able to buy (even though) I'm not old enough,  because
I'm big enough..   I think TK is a witness to that.    Moosehead!

they wont wait 1 sec to complain.  All in all I would be VERY careful... I also
wouldnt sign my name to the room. At the place I was stay it was a school trip
to Six Flags, Great Adventure| staying the school got a bill for $4000 and that

Hmm, one thing I found trashing quite awhile ago was a report by Pac-Bell on
problems they were having with their new DMS-100's...One thing was the "coin
problems"...Ill quote the letter as its fairly interesting:

Four coin problems have been discovered with the introduction of the DMS-100
in Pacific Bell.  These are:
 1. Applied +48 Volts for Coin Presence Test
 2. Coin Return Voltage
 3. Paramater - Per call ground loop detection test
 4. Overheating of GX18AB cards Real clever name there..(Did ya get the pun?)

+48 Volts associated with coin service is used for Coin Overtime, Coin Presence
Tests and Automatic Coin Toll Service (ACTS).  +48V is used in ACTS to reset
the totalizer so that coin counting can be acomplished.  NT has developed a
workaround for interfacing to ACTS.  Therefore the main problem is the coin
presence test.  In normal situations, battery is applied to Tip side with the
ring side opened.  +48V is applied to the ring sing of the line which detects
the presence of a coin or no coin.  If no ground condition exists, no coin is
present.  If a coin is stuck (ground condition) a line 112 report will print in
the CO.

Without +48V this cannout be done.

In a situation where a customer deposits .20 cents on a call requiring a .50
cent deposit, the .20 cent deposit is not being returned.  The TSPS machine,
handling all call processing, will instruct the End Office to sent out voltage
(Normal +110 Volts for collect and -110 for return) that will return the inital
deposit.  ACTS then resets the totalizer which enables coin counting to begin
on the initiation of the required .50 cent deposit.  Presently, the DMS is not
doing this.


well whatever.

watch out for...  If you see a large, fat, pear shaped "person" (describing
him as either sex would be insulting) with a bulge in its pants...KICK IT! as
hard as you can.  Because it mmost likely is going to be a camera or tape

"bugging" me (no pun intended). About him going to Summercon, I say...tell him
no. After all, you guys have the final say so dont you. If you have any doubts,
just read the last posts. Hell, its obvious that he's happy as a fucking lark.
And if you still have any qualms, think about it like this :

Would you invite a fagg to YOUR party?

    As I said, there are alot more non-elitist going to the party then you all
think. I could count out at least 20 off hand that non of you have probably
ever heard of. All I can say is, good luck. If I were you I would print up a
big article in Phrack and say its cancelled, then only invite selected people.

    Okay, since no one ever agrees with me, I thought I would explain my self
this time around and hopefully make you understand that if alot of people show
the show wont go. Im sure alot of you realize what kegs cost and Im sure with
all the folks showing up (most of them probably not pitching in much - do they
ever?), we are not going to be drinking as much as we like. 100 people in two
rooms (not counting Broadway) - how wonderful. What do the people do who cant
fit - (idea!) sit in the lobby and wait of course. Where do the people who can
no longer stand go when its time for all 100 (in two rooms) people to crash? I
couldnt tell you. What happens when the cops come? We run. What happens when
Mrs Blow's son ends up in jail - she sues (or at least causes alot of bs), what
happens when the cops, finding drunken people in the hallway, stumble across a
drunken Taran King. They bust him and get him for many things including
Intoxification (minor), Serving Minors (is that a law?), Causing a Publid
Disturbance...among other things. What happens when Jay hits the "tank"...he
gets 4 years in an Indiana Correctional Institure (Ive always wanted to pick
potatoes). I was just thinking of everyone else, mostly TK.

I have been to some pretty big partys, the majority of which were busted. Big
partys are big news, and tend to draw attention from the less desirables
(mainly cops). Contrary to what many on here have stated, the only place I
would invite a faggot is the next Challenger to the stars. Now, Ive said my
peice, and of course, as always, someone will disagree, someone will rag or
someone will generally be pissed off, hate me for life, "de-"friend me or
whatever. I know, Ive been a real negative, burnt-out, stupid-ass...BUT I DONT

I think people are overestimating what will occur at SummerCon.  I hardly
expect 100 people to show up.  Shit, even if that many do, a lot of people
seem to be getting their own rooms...but for them to toss in like $5-$10, it
shouldn't be a big deal.  If the kegs don't work out, we'll just get cases of
something (not as good, but still does the trick).  As for being busted because
too many people show up, only phreak/hacks will be allowed into the room as
this is not an opened "party", per say.  We will not be too rowdy because we
are in these rooms for 2 nights and we cannot afford to be kicked out,
therefore, people WILL be quiet (Friday night anyway) and people WILL NOT be
wandering around the hotel drunk unless they're in another room which won't
affect ours.  The rooms will NOT be trashed because we're not positive h ow
getting them will go (it will be under a fake name, but if they need ID, we're
going to have to use someone's real one probably).  I don't know, we'll work it
out, but don't expect all of those obnoxious things that usually happen at
hotel parties to happen because if we get kicked out, people can't just drive
or stumble back home afterwards...

As far as Big hotel parties go it's usually not a question of cops showing up.
It's more a question of Hotel Management.  As far as that goes, hotel
management is usually pretty cool about not kicking partiers out because they
still make money off those people (as long as shit ain't getting torn up) and
it's bad publicity to kick a bunch of drunk people out of a hotel because they
end up driving drunk.  Also public intoxacation of a minor is a crime but being
in a hotel gets you out of being publically intoxicated.  About the kegs,
because there's a $25 deposit on kegs and $50 deposit on tappers I seriously
doubt that we'd be getting kegs unless we can come up with a large quantity of
money ahead of time. (Very unlikely).

  If you ask me (you don't), mentioning the word 'party' or 'beer' or anything
like that in the same sentence/post as 'SummerCon' is only yelling to the
world that something is going to be goinng on. Now, it would be better if ther
would have been nothing mentioned of partying, until we got there. Anyway, I
don't think it should be such a party where everyone has to pass out, I'm not

A funny story about Phil-Con the last Big (not nearly as big as Summer-C on
will be) phreak conference.

Tuc and I only knew what hotel it was, no room number and the name it was
supposed to be under was not checked in. We saw a photocopied paper saying:
"You hold the Keys to Security" with the Pennsylvania Bell logo. Scrawled on
the bottom was Phreak-Con IV. No room number there, but it did prove that they
were there, somewhere...

Well we came to the conclusion that the only way to find them was check every
room assuming either a door would be open and we would recognize Videosmith
and the others, or they would be making enough noise for us to hear. After
about the 3rd floor of listening, I was not paying attention and had my ear
about 6 inches from a door, listening for phreaks (a smart move, hey we had no
other way of finding them ok? ok?) and there was a hotel security guy. Well
while I was busy looking like a theif, Tuc saw him, with the eagle eye he has,
as the guy was 2 or 3 yards away. Well of course he wondered what I/we were
doing. We told him the truth (not a misatake for once) and he checked our ID.

Then we asked if there were any complaints. Well he remarked about about some
guys stealing all these hotel phones... A giveaway. We told him thanks and got
the room . That was them allright. We spent the remainder of the night being
chased by security and hiding phones. (Not really us (me, Tuc, and Videosmith)
but the locals) of course it was unavoidable or just plain stupid to just sit
and wait to be ejected from the hotel so we departed also.

Anyhow, they were never thrown out just warned many times. And thats it. Just
thought I would relay that story for those few people interested.

Name: Evil Jay 26
Date: 1:45 am  Sat May 23, 1987

   Because of alarms they now have the machine, use the following catiously.

1) The quarter with the hole drilled in the middle will work on most machines.
   Its just hard to get the quarter back above the credit pin.

2) There is ALWAYS an extra set of keys to the front or back of the machine,
   hanging on the inside of the door.

3) The back wood they use (for the back) is like cardboard. It makes a big
   noise when cracked, but cracked it is - and easily.

4) ROM chips can be sold.

5) The penny up the coin slot still works on older games, like Pac Man. On
   MIDWAY games justflip the penny in the quarter inch slot up in the coin
   return. Flip it til it goes up, and hopefully you'll get a credit. On Atari
   games and similiar (ones with vertical coin slots), hold your finger up
   inside the coin return slot so the penny wont fall all the way down. Drop a
   penny in and once it sits there, carefully move it into the next slot on the
   right (right next to it). Flip it up. Nickels are easier.

1/70: Red Box......
Name: The Disk Jockey 13
Date: 4:24 am  Sun Apr 26, 1987

Back at the private school I went to, everyone lived pretty much out of state,
and would always be calling their girlfriends back at home, thus making a
pretty big investment into the local payphones.  After reading the files on
how a red box worked, took my little dictation recorder and went to a payphone
and found that I could record the tones that were made when you dropped
quarters in.  I recorded about $4 worth of quarters, and it worked great.
Every time the computerized voice would say "Please deposit $1.70 for the past
5 minutes" you could just play the tape via a pair of sony walkman headphones
into the mouthpiece, and the phone would think that you deposited money in it.
It was pretty neat back then (several years ago.....) but every now and then
you would get the regular operator on instead of that synthasized voice.

Yes, not really important, but I saw "red box" in that last message and it
reminded me of that.  Those were the days when there were lots of extenders
with 3 and 4 digit codes, and PBX's with NO codes.....

Date: 10:13 pm  Mon Apr 27, 1987

The best way to box is to pull a cat's tail after making a call, then get a
rubber band and twang it in your teeth like Snoopy for MF.

Since we were talking about supervision a little bit, I went through some
stuff I had on translations. What I think makes a number unsupervised  (besies
the fact that there is no return of supervision, or reverse battery
signalling) is the charging translation in the terminating office. The
screening code of a chart class (charges and route are determined by the chart
class I believe) that denotes the call charge type would register to not make
either a detailed or bulk AMA entry at the toll office (if the number is 1+
for someone), since it as if the number never answered. A 'detailed' AMA entry
shows the calling and called numbers, whereas a bulk AMA entry shows only the
calling number.

Something else about translations, it doesn't mean an 800 to POTS or special
BTN when people talk about ESS translations, but the information on particular
Directory Numbers that finds and identifies the line equipment of the called
number (calling also I believe) that would provide any special info that is
needed by the switch to process the call, for example, whether a call is
coming from one or two party lines, or whether it is a four party line with
full selective ringing (which can't be tested by MLT equipment which is why I
remember it). If no translation influenced the way the call is processed, then
how would the switch know to route tthe calling party to an operator for ONI
if the calling line was more than two party (with the specifications talkd
about earlier about the R and T leads status determining the billing also
taken into consideration).

Anyway, this post is basically correct but if anyone finds any errors then
please correct me.

  Well, RC's on an ESS are called translations too, at least when done by an
RC-MAC clerk. RC data involving a line that is changed can be called
translations. Don't ask me why this is so, but it's what I've heard.

  Does anyone here know what an ANIF-7 is? As far as I can tell, it is an ANI
failure to TSPS, but that's all I know about it...it can probably happen
anytime, but I do know that it was a specific problem with an early 5ESS
generic.

  Oh yeah, another unsuped signusoid is at (618)235+0090..this was found by
Syntax Error a long time ago. A neat thing about these 'tone sweeps' is that
if you call through an OCC that uses an OUTWATS line that is set up on an
inband signalling trunk, the OUTWATS linne will be trunked from the other end.
This happens as the tone gets near 2600Hz, but it is more sensitive on an OCC
switch, as something like 2710 and 2500 will also reset or trunk their
equipment, or at least that's what I've found.

I saw before that someone mentioned that the amount of money entered into a
payphone of some kind is not kept track of.  If this is true then it would
seem impossible for MA DUMBELL to ever catch on to red-boxing.  That is if
AT&T phones don't have a money counter in them.  TK-When the money was
collected from the payphone, did you notice whether he had the amount of money
that was "supposed" to be in there?  Or whether he even checked it?

If the money is counted then it is possible that the person who collects the
coins would get in trouble for not reporting all the money that was
registered.  The money not being there because of redboxing.

It is also possible to red box off of blue AT&T payphones (without a money
slot).  I am curious whether that can EVER be found out, since there is no
money counter (obviously) to check.

17/70: Muxing, Etc
Name: Doom Prophet 21
Date: 4:56 pm  Fri May 01, 1987

Lucifer, I think what you mean about the bandwidths changing in Multiplexing,
you are referring to voice frequency bandwidths. Multiplexing is just a method
of sending more than one converstation down the same transmission path. In
analog and older switches the method is called Frequency Division
Multiplexing, or FDM, when the signals are seperated on basis of frequency, as
opposed to newer switches which do it on a Time division basis (TDM). There's
also something called Space DM but I don't think it has a whole lot to do with
telephones (maybe stuff like digital Xmission). But anyway, a normal VF voice
bandwidth goes from 300 to 3000 Hz which is SF in band, although the VF
channel goes from 0 to 4000 Hz. Anything above 3000 is out of band signalling
(like 3700 Hz). CCIS uses a seperate nettwork composed of STP's and varioius
links and channels for independent signalling methods.

About the red boxing, the circuits that keep track of the coins that have been
entered are called Coin Detection & Announcement circuits (if the fortress is
in an ACTS serving area), which are a part of the Station Signalling
Announcement Subsystem which work out of local offices and in conjunction with
TSPS (not TOPS as far as I have seenn,  a flash of the switchook anytime
during the initial charge announcements and an operator is connected. Playing
the tones to a live operator wouldn't be a good idea as they can obviously
tell the difference.

Something else, there was a little discussion about AMA and all (isn't there
everywhere?) a while back. The way a local office (LAMA) would keep track of
the billing data is to use a few AMA circuits (there are always two, AMA0 and
AMA1 but can be more for big offices) that reverse positions (from an active
to standby mode at midnight when the datta in the buffer is recorded onto the
actual tapes). So the AMARC computers can format the data to where it is
recognnized by the RAO, the tapes have to be specially customized for that
particular officere. A header label on the tape (put on at the beginning of
each new tape entry (12)) tells the originating NPA, the office number, date
and tape transport dates. A tape trailer is added on at the end of the tape
entry for that day, which has the info about how many total calls were AMA
recorded. The tape mark is some digit (?) that tells the RAO that the useful
info (that they need to look at) is ended. The billing data itself is in a
binary coded decimal form (0's and 1's) along with check and dummy codes. A
noncheck dummy code fills the spaces on the tape to signigy that there wasn't
a problem, but the space is supposed tobe there. A check dummy code is because
the info wasn't received or sent from the Peripheral Adress bus or from the
originating register into the charge buffer. If you ever come across AMA
records (like in the call store section of SCCS) it won't look like anything
that can determine billing (AMARC and RAO do that). They aren't too hard to
read though, just takes a while.

You mentioned the third time of multiplexing as Stad DM or something, I
believe  what you mean is Stattistcal Time Division (STDM).  A STDM is just
a normal TDM improved so that empty bandwiths (which occur on TDM) are used
by busy ones.  This allows a hell of alot more efficient use of the line then
TDM's.  STDM is mainly used when you have alot of terminals/whatever that
wont always be being used.

 Circuit Breaker, what LMOS system do you have access to? Do you (it looks
like it to me) have access to only the unix Front End system, or do you have
the IBM VM370 host processor? Anyway, not all front ends are the same, try
accessing the Cross Front End (XFE) via the Network Manager program
(/usr/lbin, I think) nmx or the NMstatus program and checking for those
specific files you posted about. I'll have to check the LMOS I have access to
and see if those particular files you posted about exist. You also might want
to look at the CRSAB RSA's help files for asyncronous terminal connections in
the help directories. You are probably already good at unix, but try this to
locate those help dirs:

$ cd /
$ du *>/dev/du.txt&

 Then in a few minutes, do

$ cd /dev
$ cat du.txt


 That will give you a listing of all the directories on that system, and if
you see any that resemble help files then go there and cat everything...

can, there are many phones I know of that do not have the metal encasing
around the wires.  I have to try it.  I am pretty sure that bypassing the
simple hardware of the payphone console itself does not grant open access to
all outside lines.  Or does it?

27/70: Payphone Wires.....
Name: The Disk Jockey 13
Date: 7:33 am  Mon May 04, 1987

At the school in Indiana that I went to, there were tunnels that connected
every building in the school together and dated back to the early 1900's, so
we would get drunk and cruise down there and check out old crap that you find
laying around in the basements that some of these tunnels went to.

ANYWAYS,  in one of these tunnels there was a HUGE phone block with hundreds
of cable pair.  I brought the dandy test-set one night and started trying
different connectors to get a dialtone.  When I did get a dialtone, I tried to
dial a local number, only to get a "please deposit 20 cents" recording, so my
guess from that experiance would be that the phone doesn't make much of a
difference, and that you would NOT be able to dial direct calls on it.

I have a driver's license that says I'm like 24, and I look it, so I too can
buy for any who need it.  Michigan licenses are the easiest to change, just as
(ask) any Michigan person who was born in 1967.

Name: Phantom Phreaker 46

  Come to think of it, it is the actual line and not the phone in most cases,
take a look at the Class of Service or Universal Service Order Code in an ISVH
(ISH) or an INQ from COSMOS or get it via an Basic Output Report (BOR). Now,
if you really wanted to go out of your way to 'fix' a payphone to where you
could dial out normally, you might be able to accomplish this via RC-MAC, or
maybe an SCC. But if you did do this it would almost certainly die when the
bill came.

PS-I will post up pertinent data from an ISH upon various payphones next time
I log on, if anyone would like to see it.





29/70: Payphone ISH
Name: Phantom Phreaker 46

  Ok, I ISHed a few payphones and here's the results:

  The STatus was (of course) WK (Working), the TYPE was C (Coin), the Class of
Service (CS) is CN (CoiN), the Universal Service Order Code (US) is 1PC, which
means single party something.. can't remember. The Line Class Code (LCC) field
contained CDF, I don't know what  CDF means though.

  On older post-pay telephones (the kind where it either gives you a loud
annoying 'buzz' when the calling party answers, or the kind that allows you to
hear them but them not hear you until you put your coins in) probably have a
US of 1PP (Single party, Post Pay), and Coin First phones (the kind that you
must put money in to get a dialtone) have a US of 1CF (Single party, Coin
First).

Hope that helped,

Name: Doom Prophet 21

Ok, I hadn't seen that in LMOS yet, CB, thanks for the info. There are other
ways to access the info in an intermediate call store section/buffer of sorts
from SCCS, and of course the AMARC systems. On another board, Phantom asked
what AMASE was, I would think that it could be an abbreviated form of 'AMA
Sensor', you know, BDT's,  CDA's, and ESS software format sensors, or special
VSS sensors maybe.

On LMOS..some of the things are common knowledge (in BSTJ's and all) but I
will post a few and what they do.

Let's see, to screen status troubles, ttry /FOR MSCR. You may have to know
employee codes of the screener and the MC code, it's been a while since I've
been on.
                                                                        
The different actions in the Mechanized Screener transactions are run an MLT
test, get job and work info, run RST transaction, read mail, clear the mask
(indicating no action), review desk items, return to original status, put item
on the Local Test Desk (used to test lines that the MLT/LTS equipment can't
for some reason, such as selective ringing multiparty lines), put screener in
the off duty status (returning work items into the pool I believe). Others are
/Te (Trouble Entry), DISP, etc.

Something somewhat interesting,  in the /tmp direcoty for an FE, look at the
Console/log0 file, which contains countters and info on how many certain
transactions have been done for a certain time period (RBOR is in there but
I'm not sure about the rest). Other commands do things like add changes to
LMOS tables, look at work summaries, check all jobs related to a certain CTTN
(cable trouble ticket number) or TTN, and review all work items for specific
FE's. If anyone wants anything specific about some of these commands leave ma
(me) a letter or post since it seems  the discussion is going good. I'm sure
Marauder or others could proably correct me on a few points, but oh well.

36/70: Call Blocking/Loops/etc.
Name: Phantom Phreaker 46
Date: 11:09 pm  Thu May 07, 1987

    Circuit Breaker, what I meant was that I was fucked up, and having a hard
time typing legibly. That's all.

    Call blocking is a vague term, can you tell us what it relates to, CAMA,
ANI, PBX's, or what? A basic description is that it is what happens when the
network is operating at peak, and all trunks are busy, and thus the caller
gets a re-order or is left sitting there.

 Be more specific if you can, because there is also a thing called 'blocking'
on PBX's which is similar but on a smaller scale.

  To whoever asked about the collect call to the loop, well loop-around
numbers are probably either an Official or a Test line, at least the ones I
have seen. So unless they set some type of screening to it so it can't accept
collect calls then you could collect call a loop, but hope that you didn't
dial direct from your home because your number would be on their phone bill.

 Control C, since you seem to have a manual or something on ESS, could you
tell me what a RC15 report is, I am very confused about them. Thanks...

SFD posted in the previous sub abour coin tests. I ask you this. The CO, upon
completion of a call, removes -48 volts from the ring, ground from the tip and
either a -130 volts(Refund) or +130 Volts(Collect) is applied to the tip to
operate the cion relay in the phone. If Someone were to have acces to the
exposed wires outside of the phone, wouldn't they be able to simulate the
voltage necessary to refund their own money(Theoretically speaking if they
could simulate the voltage in a Phone Booth of course)? Would that Be
Possible? I also broke out my testboard, Station, and network Manuals and
Found that their is some significance in turning the handset of the payphone
upside down. I can't find out exactly why yet, but it is all over the "Coin
Maintenance Check Booklet" that bell uses as reference for Coin Stations. I
will search more through the book and see what I can find.

If you hack a mailphone system of some kind that only requires the number to
be called and the initia message will be played, then you can have the message
say, "Hello?........Sure. hangup|" This will enable you to make a third party
billing call to anyone and use the mailphone system as the party paying for
the call.  The operator will cal up the mailphone, the msg will play and
she'll hear the person being billed say, "Sure." when asked if they accept the
charge.

In any case if you want to make a call bill it to 312-410-7132, and it will go
straight through.

39/70: Call blocking
Name: Lotus 38
Date: 3:44 am  Fri May 08, 1987

I know that in parts of Florida that a new system uses the term "call
blocking" simply to stop someone in your co's area from calling you.  You would
do something like "*80+number to block" and when that number calls you , a
"You can not dial XXX-XXXX at this time. Try again later"

Other features include immediate call back.  This allows you to hit a few
keys on the phone and call back whomever just called you (again, only if
they are in your local co).

Anyone else have info on this?



40/70: Collect Calls.....
Name: The Disk Jockey 13
Date: 6:55 am  Fri May 08, 1987

A few years ago, in school (out of state) everyone had their ways  making free
calls, someone had a number to a recording, something like that VMS, and it
said "This number accepts all collect and 3rd party billing calls" and it
worked all the time.

Another way is to make a collect call to an out-of-state extender.  Let me say
it this way....

I'm calling from 219 (Indiana) and I call the local MCI node in Chicago
collect.  The operator asks "your name" and you say in a fem voice
"Brenda"....the call will go through, and you will here the usual MCI tone.
RIGHT AWAY, you press a number on t touch tone pad, this will silent the MCI
tone.  Then you say in your own voice "Hello?"  for all the operator knows,
you are the one that answered!  The only problem is that you have to work
fast, else you get a re-order in about 15 seconds.

I will get more specific on the Call Blocking I am refering to. It isn't what
Lotus suggested. That Sounds more like DMS-100 Options(Sounds Exactly like
them, in fact). I thought that the FCC wouldn't allow AT&T to use those
options, though. Maybe I was mistaken. I think that the call blocking I was
refering to is more towards the overload on any paticular circuit as was
mentioned before.

 Call Blocking is indeed a feature of (C)LASS....but that CLASS feature is
LATA based around LCCIS, not upon a CO and intraoffice calls. For more info
read any CLASS file, or check out LOD/H TJ 1, file 1, CLASS, by Videosmith.
It explains it pretty clearly. There was a PBX test number in 305 (the testing
grounds of CLASS) that I had gotten somewhere that had a demo of CLASS
features on it, such as Call trace, selective call forwarding, call blocking,
etc. It was called Touch-Star, I think, or maybe Touch-Tel, one of the two.
Anyway, LASS is used in the 717 (Harrisburg, PA) NPA.

 (I forgot something)

 DMS-100 does have something like it's own call blocking. It can be used to
restrict certain types of lines from calling other types. The destination
switch checks the information sent in from the (intraoffice) DN, (I think the
Screening Code, probably) or from an INC (incoming trunk). This can be done to
restrict access to official lines and such.

Well, I don't know that much about FACS, although I don't believe that it
really acts as a replacement for COSMOS, more like an integration/mini datakit
sort of thing for the different systems related to cosmos.

Mad Hatter was asking about CAROT in mail, and I looked through some stuff and
here is some info about the system. It consists of the two processors for the
CAROT (database section), the data and the test processor. The TP controls and
directs the ROTL's and the Circuit Maintenance System (I've seen CMS-1B and
also CMS-3A, don't know what the current version is). CMS 3A is used with
TIRKS also. Anyway, the CAROT controller (which is supported by the two
processors) can do something like 14 tests at the same time (at night when
their is less traffic on the trunks). The CC also analyzes and sends out the
test results to the appropriate departments or offices (the CO, an SCC or a
CTTU station). The ROTL is accessed just by the technician dialing it, which
is why anyone can dial them. The ROTL is controlled by MF input of the trunk
group and network numbers. I have seen TNN's as being three digits,  but I
guess it depends upon the office size. The ROTL seizes the trunk to be tested.
The ATMS responder (Automated Trunk Measurement System) is connected to the
ends of the tested trunk to receive tthe test measurements. The ROTL somehow
attaches test equipment to the origiinating end of the trunk. Other test lins
are used for the terminating end (going into another CO or switch)...I'm sure
everyone knows there are dialups to CAROT, these are from the Remote User
Multiplex, the ports for remote terminals to call in through (unless the
dialup serves for some type of diagnostics testing upon the test equimpment
itself). 16 people can be on the same RUM....I don't know if that means 16
people can dial the same dialup and somehow still connect (highly improbable).
Lex would probably know more about it.

50/70: Advanced 800
Name: Taran King 1
Date: 5:00 pm  Fri May 15, 1987

Well, I know that many people have been told that to get translations for 800
numbers, they should call an office that has access to the NCP database.  I
just read a bit about it in CO which I thought was sort of interesting.  It's
part of DSDC (Direct Services Dialing Capabilities).  The subscriber dials the
800 number which is then routed to a 4E.  From there, it goes to the ACP
(Action Control Point or is it ACtion Point?|) which is software that
determines the special type of call (toll free/976/etc.).  The ACP gets it's
(its) information from the NCP which is the Network Control Point.  The NCP
database receives the call information through CCS and checks on the customer
service information that the call information goes with, thereby determining
how to route the call and sends the info back to the ACP.  The SMS (Service
Management System) is used to update information and for definition of that
information.  The NCP database can contain various information such as where
the translation routes determined by origin of call or time of day too.

I have a question about CCS.  What is signifigant about the number version? I
mean, is the information transmitted done differently (different protocol or
manner of sending) or is it just updates to the way it's wired up?  McBlah

same method of signaling for this.  Hmm...Oh well, still, I want to know about
the different versions of CCS.  Later

signalling system No. 6) which are centered around an International Switching
Center (ISC). CCITT No. 6 can identify 2048 trunks (CCS can ID 8192 trunks).


   I have some pages from an old BSTJ on CCIS in front of me, they have a good
amount of information about CCITT6 in here. One interesting table inn here is
Calling parties categries, which are in bits 13-16 of a CCITT No. 6 'message',
there are provisions for operators in French, English, German, Russian, and
Spanish, and other user selectable languages, data call, test call, spare,
etc. I'll have to read more about this, it would be interesting to find out
how you could make an int'l call over CCITT No. 6 (or maybe 7 now as someone
said) as a test call.

60/70: 900 numbers explained
Name: Phantom Phreaker 46
Date: 9:35 pm  Tue May 19, 1987

   I was really interested in how 900 numbers worked, it is not common phreak
knowledge, so I researched via a BSTJ and a little bit of engineering.
Actually, I wrote a file on the Mass Announcement System (MAS) that is  about
80 sectors, but I never released it because I thought no one gave a fuck. If
anyone here wants this file, mail me and I'll get it to you somehow, or upload
it here.

   900 numbers do terminate in a Number 4 ESS, the 4E that has been allocated
as your MAS node. As of 1980 (old info, I know) there were 7 No. 4 ESS
switches that were MAS nodes. That number might be more now, butt the nodes
were in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, LA, Newar,  and Philly. Each one of
these covers a particular part of the country. (oops, that 'Newar' up there is
supposed to be 'Newark'). For instance, if Randy dialed 1-900-555-1212 (the
Dial it 900 service information line) his call would be sent to the Atlanta
No. 4 ESS MAS node. If Mad Hatter dialed the same number, his call would be
sent to the Philly MAS node. (Oh, Alaska and Hawaii are also included in
this).

  Back to the original question by Crax, 900 numbers can terminate in a POTS
number, but I have never seen it done, so I would guess that it's not a common
occurance. This is called cut through calling, or technically, Media
Stimulated Calling (MSC). MSC basically sends one call per some unit of time
to a DDD number.

  The place that handles the maintenance and administration of all No. 4 ESS
MAS offices is called ONAC, Operations Network Administration Center. I think
the ODAC are centralized in Kansas City, Mo, which seems kind of strange
because there isn't a MAS node there (that I know of).

  One interesting thing about MAS services is the way Recent Changes are done,
through an RCRRT2 (Remote Recent Change, don't ask me why the acronym doesn't
match) channel, which is hardwired to ONAC. If one ever trashed ONAC or a 4E
MAS node, you could probably find some actual switch output messages. Those
would be interesting to see. So if anyone ever does any trashing like this
then let me know.

it. The main point is, in case for some emergency reason, he must log on

file command, and a few others. What I wanted to do was list the ascii files
in a cosnix directory (assume the /usr/cosmos directory, where COSMOS three
letter command source is kept, but there couldcii or English Text in it). I
would do it like this on unix:

$ ls -a</tmp/asciick&

 Then when that process was done:

$ grep ascii /tmp/asciic/tmp/final&

 Then check that file when it was done and it would have a listing of the
ascii files. Since you cuse the type command, and can't use file, I'd rather
not look through a long directory listing, and even then it's ot always ascii.
So does anyone have any shell scripts that might help me out?

This only worked on some phones.  Others, after I dialed 10, I would get the

I have found that kp and st are not necessary when dialing off of a trunk.
After seizing the trunk, ac+ is all that is needed to call out.  This seems
strange.  Any comments?

You are not seizing an interoffice trunk.

What you are doing is kind of pseudo-boxing, which is what we used to do
here in New Jersey. What would happen is that we would use MCI, get a
destination and then blow 2600. Since there were no restrictions on the
band width, and no filters, we would blow back a dial tone that was possible
to make international as well as alliance calls with crystal clarity.

I don't know the exact name of this but just that we weren't
seizing a trunk.

  Icarus, what you are talking about sounds like boxing using a DP (Dial
Pulse) trunk. DP 'boxing' doesn't use KP and ST, they use a time-out feature.
DP is made up of short bursts of 2600Hz tone. It isn't all that common as far
as I know, but some older SxS offices supposedly use it for outpulsing on
interoffice calls and to CAMA for billing. This means that either the homing
CAMA office can record dial pulse trunk signalling, or there is some sort of
sensor to translate it to MF before reception by the CAMA MF digit recievers.

Name: Phantom Phreaker 46
Date: 2:46 am  Sun Apr 26, 1987

  The numbers before/after CAROT are the generic and version.. for instance
2CAROT3 is CAROT 2, generic 3. The highest I have seen is 2CAROT4, but there
are probably more. Also a number that refers to a CAROT system could also be
it's particular number, if there is more than one in a particular area.

  RC-MAC (Recent Change Memory Administration Center) is a place where a clerk
enters information into an electronic switching system via a Recent Change
terminal. The information changed can be a variety of things, but things like
Class of Service, CCF's, EA Interlata Carriers (called a PIC, Primary
Independent Carrier, I believe, something along those lines), etc. Data that
is to perform Recent Changes upon an ESS switch is screened by a computer
system called RMAS (Remote Memory Administration System) for validity. RMAS is
generally running under a unix OS.


 A few actual Recent Changes look something like this:

RC:LINE;CHG:
ORD XXXXXXX
TRC
!

 That is an RC upon a line, to change something. The TRC is TRaCe, I think,
and the ! is needed for some reason.
 You can also have:

RC:MLHG;CHG: (RC upon a Multi Line Hunt Group); RC:MPTY;TWPTY: (RC upon a
Multi Party line, a 2 party line)

 Oh yeah, those examples I typed in might be wrong, I don't memorize them or
anything so don't sue me if they aren't right. Also they are for a 1AESS.

Hatter, RC-MAC does have COSMOS access, at least they have a login prefix
assigned as 'RECENT CHANGE', which is RCxx, where the xx is two numbers. Theyy
don't seem to logged on that often though. Some other systems they may have
access to include RC/V, Recent Change annd Verify, I don't understand RC/V
that much, but RC/V has channels into electronic offices, just like RC
channels. RMAS is access to an RC channel.

office, but this all depends on what you want to get done.  I believe they
have access to RC terminals (makes sense anyway...) so you could get then to

CT03     To indicate that an interoffice or outgoing seven-digit call has been
         placed form a directory number to another directory number.

CT04     To indicate that the incoming call has been placed to the indicated
         directory number from a trunk.  The trunk network number (TNN) is
         given.  Translation information for the called directory number or
         the terminating directory number indicated that a trace should be
         made of all calls to this number.

CT05     Indicates thatan outgoing ten digit call has been placed from
         directory number to another directory number.  A check of the
         Calling Line Identification (CLID) list indicates that a trace of
         all calls to this ten-digit number should be made.

CT06     To print the contents of the CLID list in response to input message
         CI-LIST or as the result of an error being detected in a CLID entry
         by audit 32. The audit will remove the directory number in which the

  Network Administration is also known as the NAC, Network Administration
Center, also called Dial Assignment. They are located in the BOC building, I
believe, along with the LAC (Loop Assignment Center) and SSC (Special Service
Center) and a few others. The NAC basically deal with new lines being put in,
they do things like figure out how to evenly distribute the number of lines so
there won't be any shortage, and things like that, it's similar to the LAC but
I don't know any big differences in the two right now.

  Ctrl C, where did you get the CT0X message summaries? Pretty good info
though, but I can say that I have only seen a CT06 (when I pulled it up), a
CT04, and a CT03 message. CT04 ID's a TNN (as he said) connected through the
destination ESS to a particular DN. It can then be determined the general area
of where the call is coming from from the TNN. But there is differences if you
are calling over interoffice trunks (local calls) or tandem trunks, or long
haul, or inter-LATA...

Ok, for all you D00ds, here's some really hot classified information on Telco
offices and the systems they use for maitenance functions. If you run into a
problem engineering, simply say you are from any of the following offices. I
will go into a brief description of each below. Enjoy!


FUCK-Facilities Utilization Control Kitchen. A really hot office. They keep
backups of all systems per a LATA, or in special cases, the entire BOC area,
along with user logs and passwords. They use the CUNTLICK system to interface
with SHIT, explained momentarily. They ar difficult to reach as no one knows
their number, and anyone calling it has to enter a special queue dispenser
where he enters routing information to reach the FUCK ACD. The FUCK
technicians answer as normal subscribers and you have to tell them a codeword.

PENIS-Plant Engineering Network Information System. Used by the PMS to deal
with outside plant details and layout maps.

CUNTLICK-Computer Utilities Network In the Control Kitchen. Used to sensor
with SHIT.

SHIT-Supreme Hardware Inventory Totals. Self explanatory.

CRAP-Customer Repair Analysis Service. They use PENIS to supply PMS with info.

PISS-Primary Intertoll Switching Servicemen. Corrdinate classes 1 through 4
toll offices and monitor the STP's.

BITCH-Building Installation Table Channel. Used by SHIT technicians to obtain
new switch and office status.

SCAB-Switching Cable Analysis  Burea. They work with PMS for trunk testing and
maintenance. The systems they use are FART and DOPAMINE.

Well, that's about all! Oh, don't forget BASTARD (Box Accessible System To Aid
Real D00ds).  A special in band NPA with full OSC support for blue boxers to
experiment within legally (only operating in special areas).

That's all! Hope it helped!!!1

Hey now, hey now, that was sheer incompetence...leaving out the following!

BOOGER - Bell Operational Office for Generation of ESS Reports.  Self

STAN - Spanish Tacos And Nachos.  This support group, Californian based,
maintains food services for all superior employees (all employees).

NATE - Nacho And Taco Emissary.  This department secretly interfaces STAN with
the rest of the network due to the STAN group's inability to fit in with
society.  **Due to divestiture, NATE and STAN are no longer part of the
network**

IL DUCE - Not an acronym, but the janitorial services department of the
network.

PUMPKIN - Peripheral Unit Modulator Phor Kitchen Installations of NATE.  This
group is in charge of interfacing kitchen activities through Project Genesis.
See RAPE.

BRRR-RING - The official word for the sound an AT&T phone makes receiving an
incoming call.

BANANA - Basic Analog Network Analog Network Analog (No wonder they went
digital!!!).

RAPE - Red Afro-PUMPKIN Enthusiast.  This group, led by Peter, cheers IL DUCE
while he sweeps the floors.

SCOOP - Secondary Command Output Only Procedure.  This converts all text to
lower case.  It is a function used in most Bell computers along with LEX.

LEX - Lengthy Explanitory Xlations.  This program, found alongside SCOOP,
converts all lowercase text, from SCOOP, into upper case and 40 columns
surrounded by "$"s.

** Warning!  Never leave SCOOP and LEX running simultaneously or you will
surely cause L666 to occur. **

L666 - The warning message generated by computers indicating endless Loops of
conflicting jobs.  This also indicates that everything is fucked.  See LOKI.

LOKI - Life Over-Kill Inscentive.  If you find this error message on your
computer, do not reboot the computer, but be sure to reboot something (HINT
HINT!).

the kind that are only dialable via the actual 800 number, or by someone using
a blue box to trunk off a number within an NPA (toll office actually) that is
subscribed to that 800 number. I had someone get me some translations once
from a toll office in 617, you can get them by typing certain commands

ESAC, NESAC, and OSAC, and probably others I can't remember. I'll look around

24/27: Offices
Name: Doom Prophet 21
Date: 6:57 am  Fri May 22, 1987

Well Phantom, OSAC isn't a Bell or AT&T office, it is a system for operator
services support (I guess it stands for something like Operator Services
Assistance Center). From there a person can get information for certain time
periods on entire TSPS sites, such as how many calls were placed, etc,  and a
traffic analysis for day or night reports. The CLLI code is listed with the
report I believe.
CMAC is similar to RC-MAC (or so I thought) because when I was trying to get
an 800 translation, the PBX attendant at the RTM in 312 referred me to them.
They then asked me what switch it was for (the Xlation) and apparently
misundererstood my request (I guess they thought I was asking for a DN or
trunk translation). MSAC is for installation and testing of WATS lines butt
don't give out Xlations (policy by the sound of it although it was probably
just me).  I have heard differently, soo I'm not sure on tht last one (MSAC's
purpose, which I have been told NSAC does instead). Since 800's have gottenen
'advanced' I suppose the  offices for testing could be on a national level,
although MLT equipment when testing a number that has been reported as an 800
somehow accesses the actual translation  or non standard BTN automatically.
The A8FSC probably does WATS testing also, along with NASCAR (mainly used for
traffic analysis from toll centers of 800 terminations to make sure the
completion level is up to standard). TK, where is the ACP physically,  just in
the 4E itself? Do you know how the NCP receives incoming messages (the same as
an initial message on CCIS, or CCS) and in what format? Also, what data links
run to and from the NCP? Hope someone can answer my questions..

And for the record this is on the wrong sub, the idea of death in the phreak
world has really been "getting busted" or "retiring."  That is the only way we
can really think about it in our society, I mean cause phreaks just don't die
everday, but they do get busted about that often, so that gives us a more
realistic view if we were to look at the phreak zone as a true realm.

 Fatal Error 617 died from a motorcycle accident while riding in his woods.
Micro Man (617, was sysop of Newsweek BBS) called me and told me this on July
3, 1986. I guess no one else heard about this for a while, I remember the date
because it was right before the fourth of July. FE 617 was into COSMOS and ran
Metropolis, as someone said. FE 313 is a vocal phreaker and (as far as I know)
doesn't have a modem.

There is no way Galactus "knows very well" all those OS's
I would say 3 operating systems is the maximum for most hackers as far as a
complete (its never really complete) knowledge of OS's is concerned. Hell I
know VMS, UNIX, and VM/CMS very well but thats it. The rest I know enough to
get around in. OS's are like languages, people know a few words in spanish or
french but don't know how to speak fluently in those languages, but they still
tell people they can. That is what hackers do. I find this mainly on their
applications. Most hackers specialize in one operating system. Sometimes they
move on and specialize in others, sometimes they stick to the one they like.

   Galac., doesn't sound like a honest to goodness hacker.  He probably calls
us his local UNIX system and uses defaults to hack it out.

   Sounding sarcastic, but you know how it is.  1987 for users is really lousy.

have someone of interest.

The user must be experienced in some manner or have a good general knowledge
of telecommunications.  If you wish for someone to get access here, have them
make out an application for themselves, get it from them, and then upload it
to the D: drive on the AE and I'll put it up as a message.

We shall wait until Galactus shows himself more worthy of being on the board.
Now we come to the problem with Solid State.  He was kicked off not too long
ago but he wants back on (I guess).  One way or another, he said he'd be
writing up "his side" of the story so at least we'll all get to hear what he
has to say for himself.  Life is a bitch...
-TK


33/46: well...
Name: <<< Sir Francis Drake 56 >>>
Date: 7:01 pm  Fri May 22, 1987

just to get my remarks in early...Iv talked to State & Stan about it and I
think State should be let back on.

He was kicked off because he SUPPOSEDLY read msgs to/gave his pswd to Stanly.
Now this info mainly came from Stan who would claim that he used states
password "all the time".  Now since, stan is such a notorious liar the
whole thing is obviously questionable.

Now another main complaint (from what ive gathered talking to KL) is that
State would not tell TK/KL how Stan gets on MSP even though State apparently
knows.  This may sound sorta lame, but if State starts telling on stan he
wont be trusted, and it would be lame of him.

So it would seem that as long as State does not further help stand (which is
EXTRENELY unlikely even if he ever did) Stan he should be let back on as he
was/will be a "valuable user".

so there.

This is true.  In OQ's own word's "Nate is my partner in crime."  Now perhaps
you may call OQ a liar or say he is bluffing, but their friendship exists for
better or for worse.  Now both OQ and SS claim to have at least 3 or more
accounts on here anyway and Stan would like his own account to post with as
well (yeah yeah, why'd you even mention it KL, it'll never happen).  As good a
hacker that State is, I am not convinced that he should be trusted in any
aspect towards the system especially since he has aided succesful attempts to
breech its security.  I mean, thats just the way it is, nothing seems to ever
change, etc.

One other thing to mention, its not like we "owe" anyone an account and
although I suppose I have a lot of pull, Taran King will have the final say.

As far as I know, there are no wars currently in progress but in the past,
Oryan QUEST went and did MBs on Doc Holiday, The Executioner, and both of
Taran King's phone lines.  He has also repeatedly tried to gain illegal access
on this system and somehow got Nate to help him do it.  Then he has proceeded
to harass MSP members about their posts.  However, if there is a war, it is
one sided because everyone is pretty much ignoring Quest.

Hmm... I wonder why my account had 4 illegal logons...?

Welcome to Phrack World News Issue XX.  Whew!  Issue 20 already?  I have been
gone too long.  This issue features the exclusive coverage of SummerCon 1988,
which took place in St. Louis, Missouri during the weekend of July 22-24, 1988.
Before we get to the bulk of the issue I'd like to make a note that this year's
turnout was even greater than last year's with the majority of those claiming
they would attend, actually showing up... we had a great time. -KL

Please Note:  All the events depicted in this story are based on the
              observations as seen by Knight Lightning (me).

PreCon '88; A Little Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When Taran King and I went off to college, Sir Francis Drake picked up running
Phrack Inc. and PWN.  Taran gave the rights to SummerCon to Sir Francis Drake
as well, although it was not really his right to give away.  At any rate, SFD
intended to hold SummerCon '88 in New York City, possibly by trying to get Bill
>From RNOC or Tuc to help him out, since SFD lived out on the west coast.  A lot
of publicity was put out in both 2600 Magazine and WORM (a hardcopy magazine
for "cyberpunks" written and distributed by Sir Francis Drake himself).
However, eventually it became quite clear that SummerCon '88 would not be held
in NYC, at least not by SFD.

In the meantime, there was quite a bit of controversy concerning SummerCon '88
on a bulletin board known as The Forgotten Realm, run by Crimson Death 618.
Apparently the members of TFR were trying to figure out where to have the
convention.  Control C said that he would hold SummerCon '88 in Detroit,
Michigan, but the only person who really liked that idea was Ax Murderer.

Eventually it came down to two places; New York City or St. Louis, Missouri.
The discussion went on for over a month with everyone leaning heavily towards
St. Louis.   The clincher came when Prime Suspect received word from myself,
that we were indeed planning SummerCon '88 here in St. Louis.  So on June 19,
1987 (the ONE year anniversary of SummerCon '87) Crimson Death contacted
Phantom Phreaker to get to Taran King who in turn passed the word on to me and
I called Crimson Death.  We set the date and as such, the actual preliminary
planning for SummerCon '88 had begun.

Crimson Death sent the word out and I finally had a chance to release the idea
I had conceived two months prior... The Phoenix Project.  The new millennium
has begun and the rebirth of the phreak/hack community has been achieved.  In
fact, this rebirth is currently evident in a more physical fashion on a fairly
new bulletin board earning its name from my idea...

SummerCon '88; Not As Planned...                  Friday Morning, July 22, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Coincidentally, Tuc was again this year's first arrival from out of town.
Taran King, Forest Ranger, and I arrived at the airport to greet him and after
some hassle at Lambert Field, we grabbed some lunch and went to this year's
official SummerCon hotel; the Ramada Inn - Westport.

>From here things did not go exactly to plan.  Over three weeks in advance I had
reserved a double room in Forest Ranger's name to serve as the Phrack Inc. room
or whatever as sort of a base of operations.  Ramada had a super savers weekend
promotion going on all through summer where a limited number of rooms (doubles)
could be purchased for a special weekend rate of $33.90.  Well I was sure to
get this rate and was given a reservation identification number.  However, the
check-in counter at first denied this and then finally pulled up the file.
They insisted that the room was for $68.00 and that was what we were told.
They were incorrect.  At about this time, Taran and I had wandered into the
main lobby where we were confronted by a guy who subtly said, "Are you here for
SummerCon ?"

It was The Dictator, who had come from Phoenix, Arizona (602 NPA).  He had
already gotten a room (211) at the ridiculous price of $68.00.  Unfortunately,
we still had a problem, because the hotel supervisor insisted that we weren't
21 anyway and by Missouri State Law they could not legally rent us a room at
any rate.  This is when I jumped in saying we had reserved the room for Tuc who
was 22 and I had been promised the rate of $33.90.  The supervisor began to
tell some story of a computer error (yeah right) and the person who guaranteed
the room was wrong.  I argued that it was their problem and not ours if there
was indeed this computer error and that this gross display of bad business and
false advertising would be reported to the Better Business Bureau.  In the
meantime Tuc, Taran, and Forest Ranger had grabbed a copy of the Southwestern
Bell Yellow Pages (it really is easier to let your fingers do the walking) and
were checking out other hotels in the Westport area.  My biggest concern was
for all the guests driving in who thought we would be at the Ramada.  It was
not long before the hotel supervisor had spoken to the hotel manager and they
offered us the room for a flat rate of $40.00.  We took it.  The rooms were
quite nice actually and would serve our purposes well.

Taran and I ran off on separate errands, while Forest Ranger and Tuc visited
Westport Plaza to do some shopping.   When Taran and I returned, we ran into
another interesting person who said, "You guys here for SummerCon?"  It was
Dr. Cypher of Bellcore and with him was Mike (a non phreak/hack type, but cool
just the same) and Hatchet Molly, a 23 year old graduate student at Northern
Illinois University who was working on his thesis; the social atmosphere of the
phreak/hack community or something like that.

It was only about 20 minutes later when I wandered down to the lobby and found
Lucifer 666 and Synthetic Slug checking in.  Standing five feet behind them was
another fearsome threesome made up of Crimson Death 618, Phrozen Ghost, and
Surfer Bob.  PG and SB had been visiting Crimson Death earlier that week prior
to reaching SummerCon and they all arrived at the same time.  Lucifer 666 and
Synthetic Slug got a room, while the others crashed in the Phrack Inc. room.

SummerCon '88; Back At Lambert                  Friday Afternoon, July 22, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It was time for another trip to the airport for me, Taran, Tuc, and Forest
Ranger.  We arrived just in time to meet up with The Mentor and Cisban Evil
Priest.  They were easy to spot because they were the only guys on the plane
that were not wearing suits and/or did not have any children with them.

Once greetings had taken place, Mentor unveiled a surprise -- buttons
especially made for distribution at SummerCon '88.  Created with a laser
printer they displayed a large "NO FEDS" with a circle and line through it
(like a No U-Turn sign), and also naming The Phoenix Project (the board), the
baud rate, and phone number.  He brought more than enough for everyone.

After some running around the airport and a brief lounge at one of the
airport's bars, we proceeded to meet up with Control C and Bad Subscript who
had flown in from Detroit, Michigan.  We divided up again and headed for the
hotel.  Taran King, Tuc, and Cisban Evil Priest rode with me while The Mentor,
Control C, and Bad Subscript rode with Forest Ranger.  Control C decided he was
hungry and FR drove to the nearest McDonald's where he went on to cut off a
customer in the drive-through lane and pulled right to the window to pick up
some food... not his food, but who cares.

     "That will be $3.00, sir."
     "What exactly do I get for my $3.00?"
     "Two regular cheese burgers, a large fries, and a large Coke."
     "Okay!"

They took it and left, leaving McDonald's in a total disarray for at least a
half hour.

The Mentor and Cisban Evil Priest as well as Control C and Bad Subscript both
got rooms and from there SummerCon '88 really began.

SummerCon '88; Let The Good Times Roll              Friday Night, July 22, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Basically it was just a big party from here on, with the old phreaks meeting
the new, and some re-acquaintances.  Control C brought down some gifts as well
-- posters from Michigan Bell.

               "I would shred everything, because we get so much
               information out of the dumpster,  it's unreal..."

It was signed by Control C himself and he told us that these posters now appear
in all Michigan Bell central offices and other places of business.  The picture
on the poster featured Control C's own personal stash that he had gotten from
Michigan Bell.

We had some other guests arrive during the night.  Terminal Technocrat and a
friend of his (who did have a handle, but I didn't catch it) arrived from
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  A friend of Forest Ranger's named Mike also showed up
with Kari, Cary, Katie, Susie, and Amy [some serious bitches].  The main party
ran through The Dictator's room until a series of threatening calls from the
front desk forced TD to clear everyone out of his room.

In the meantime, Cary (a nymphomaniac 14-year old) was running up Tuc's phone
bill and hitting on everyone at the convention.  She ended up with Cisban Evil
Priest in his room (that he shared with The Mentor).  However, since clearing
out of The Dictator's room the majority of the party crew all ran into Mentor
and Priest's room causing quite a disturbance.  When The Mentor heard about
this he ran to his room and threw them all out.  This action set the rest of
the night's activities to a certain theme -- The Fury of Forest Ranger.

You see Forest Ranger was quite a bit drunk and became incredibly pissed off
when he found out that his friends were mistreated.  A few of us returned to
The Dictator's room where FR made several threatening phone calls to The Mentor
and was promptly hung up on.  Apparently that was the last straw because FR
went into an unstoppable rage that trashed most of the items in the room and
then he started through the hotel.  After damaging several items in the hotel
hallways, Forest Ranger proceeded to attack a light fixture in the emergency
stairwell and in doing so, sliced his hand open on the newly broken glass.

Emergency measures were called for -- Tuc and Lucifer 666 played rescue team
and took Forest Ranger to a not so nearby United States Air Force Hospital in
Illinois, where Forest Ranger was stitched up.

After the excitement, most of the people at the convention had mellowed out and
Dr. Forbin left to take Cary home (we still don't know what happened to the two
of them, but rumor is that Forbin is making a tremendous recovering from
several serious venereal diseases.)

At some point this evening Terminal Technocrat, Dr. Cypher, and a few others
decided to go on a trashing run.  It didn't really turn out as planned and they
ended up at Southwestern Bell Publications (where the cameras are almost as big
as the dumpsters).  It was unsuccessful, but at least there were no casualties.

The final interesting part of this evening was the arrival of The Leftist and
The Ur-Vile from Atlanta, Georgia.  This arrival is important to make a note of
because with the exception of the time spent immediately after they got to the
hotel, The Ur-Vile spent the entire remainder of SummerCon '88 asleep.

SummerCon '88; So What Now?                             Saturday, July 23, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just about everyone went to Union Station, a luxurious shopping mall in
downtown St. Louis.  However, a few of us including Taran King and myself
arrived at the hotel in time to meet our final guests for the weekend --
Phantom Phreaker and Doom Prophet.

Taran King and myself took a Crimson Death back to TK's to let him copy some
unreleased files for Phrack Inc. (since he had been running it at the time).
However, now those files will be put out by the original Phrack team.

The main part of the convention started sometime after that and I presented the
second public hearing of the now famous Dan The Operator/John Maxfield and the
Dan The Operator/Il Duce (Phiber Optick) recordings which were featured in
Phrack World News XV, which was published last year.  I have decided to make
this an annual event and those wishing a copy of the tape should get in contact
with me through Epsilon, The Prophet, or through Bitnet.

Unfortunately, the most important information learned at this year's convention
cannot be published.  However, when looking at the amount and the extent of
information brought forth at this year's convention, it makes last year's look
like a day at pre-school.  If the level jumps like this next year, I think that
the world had better watch out because today's phreak/hacks are definitely
getting smarter and better every year.  The key is to stay out of trouble long
enough to gain experience that will keep you out of trouble.

The Leftist brought a terminal with him and it would have been a great "toy" to
have at the convention except no one had the extra phone cord necessary to put
it to good use.

The rest of Saturday evening was just a mix of story telling, partying, and
some deep technical discussions.  There was some element of danger present.  It
would seem that because of the trouble from the previous evening that the hotel
management had arranged to have some extra security present in case things got
out of hand.  The Maryland Heights police force sent a pair of officers over,
and they were indeed the rudest individuals I have ever met.

At one point in the evening, Lucifer 666 and I had traveled down to the lobby
by way of the stairs and when arrived, the greetings from "officer friendly"
reminded me of last SummerCon's police incident ("Run to me boys!").

           (We were wearing our "NO FEDS" pins during this incident)

    "You two come here, NOW!"
    "What?  Waitasec we are guests here (holding up keys)."
    "I can't see that far, you come here, NOW!"
    "Why did you take the stairs instead of the elevator!?"
    "The elevator was too slow, sir."
    "What are you doing down here?"
    "Going to the soda and candy machines."
    "I don't want any messing around here tonight, you got that!?"
    "Yes, we are not looking for problems."

A couple of hours later, I had decided to go to my car to drop a few items off
and found myself being followed by the same officer.  After I had been to my
car, I started back towards the hotel with this jerk eyeballing me.  When I had
reached the building I asked him...

    "Is there a problem officer?"
    "No, you got a problem!?  Do you want to have a problem!?"
    "Nope."

After this incident I returned everyone's room keys, exited the hotel by a back
stairway, hopped into my car and pulled around to the front where the lobby and
the two officers were.  I calmly honked a couple of times and with my lights
off so as not to reveal my plates, gave them "the bird."  I left the area at a
rather fast pace after that.

SummerCon '88; All Good Things Must Come To An End        Sunday, July 24, 1988
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By the time I returned on Sunday morning, Terminal Technocrat and his friend
had long since been gone as well as Dr. Cypher, Hatchet Molly and Mike.  The
rest of us hung out for a while as we prepared to pack everything up and send
everyone home.  The Leftist, The Ur-Vile, Lucifer 666, and Synthetic Slug had
to cruise and in the meantime I took Tuc, Control C, and Bad Subscript to the
airport breaking five speed limits in order for them to catch their newly
scheduled flights.

After which this left me, Forest Ranger, Phantom Phreaker, Doom Prophet, The
Mentor, Cisban Evil Priest, Crimson Death, Phrozen Ghost, and Surfer Bob.  We
were soon joined by Amy and Katie and we all headed out to the St. Louis
Galleria, another shopping plaza.  On the way, we toured through some of StL's
richer sections of town and as we went on became separated from Forest Ranger
in downtown Clayton.  After five minutes of massive confusion we were once
again on track and eventually met up with Forest Ranger and Surfer Bob who was
with him at a music store inside the plaza.

We killed about two hours there between lunch, Phrozen Ghost's Unix Manual
heist from B. Dalton Booksellers, and the Phantom Phreaker/Doom Prophet Vs.
"Goons From Hell" skateboard confrontation.  So after all was said and done,
Forest Ranger took Crimson Death, Phrozen Ghost, and Surfer Bob back to Ramada
to get their car, Phantom Phreaker and Doom Prophet hit the highway, and The
Mentor and Cisban Evil Priest went with me back one last time to Lambert Field,
where I dropped them off.

And that was SummerCon '88 ...

PostCon '88; Some Things To Make A Note Of...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This year's SummerCon posters were made by Knight Lightning and they featured
AT&T, MCI, U.S. Sprint and the FON card, Southwestern Bell, ISDN diagrams, Pink
Floyd, Domino's Pizza, and many other interesting items including; Oryan QUEST!

                      "I *Demand* you attend SummerCon!"

              "I demand to be let back on MSP! or I will UNLEASH
             with FULL FORCE (and put a maintenance busy on you!)"

                    To obtain a copy of this poster contact
              Epsilon, The Prophet or try and find me on Bitnet.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Control C and The Mentor were both made members of the Legion Of Doom/Hackers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mentor's now famous Hacker's Manifesto which was first released in Phrack
Inc. Issue VII appeared in the September issue of Thrasher Magazine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        The Dictator is looking for users to call his bulletin board...
                  The Dark Side (Commodore 128) 602-789-9269
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who Was This Year's Fed/Informant?  I have some strong possibilities about
that, , but there is an interesting twist to the story.  On Monday evening,
July 25, 1988, Forest Ranger claimed that he had received a call (from a source
he refused to disclose) stating that Secret Service was indeed at SummerCon '88
and were in room 209 (right next to 211 - The Dictator's room) and another room
supposedly under Control C and Bad Subscript's room.

There were reports of supposed Secret Service agents at Ramada, but the general
idea was that even if they were legitimate, it was because of Democratic
Presidential nominee Govenor Michael S. Dukakis, who was visiting St. Louis
that weekend.  When I heard all of this, I paid no attention to it because the
way it was described, it was just a bunch of jerks being pesky about the "NO
FEDS" pins.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Thanks goes to Epsilon and Crimson Death.  Without their help, there
would not have been a SummerCon this year and thanks to their efforts, I will
see to it that there will be a SummerCon for many years to come.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to Dr. Cypher, Byteman was supposed to fly down to St. Louis for the
convention, but ran into a mishap with airport security.  In his carry-on bag
he had several switch blade knives and six blue boxes, which at the time were
believed to be detonators for some kind of explosive.  After being held at the
airport, Byteman was met by the FBI who had verified that the items in question
were not detonators, however they did recognize what they were and now Byteman
is facing charges of conspiracy to commit toll fraud, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Crimson Death claims to have received a call from John F. Maxfield a few days
preceding SummerCon '88.  Apparently he wanted an invitation to the convention.
Nevertheless, he did not show up.  Also, there was some talk about Richard
Sandza going to SummerCon, but he was not there either.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ramada Inn Lost And Found:
- Has anyone seen the 1981 Employee Of The Month Plaque?
- Whoever took it must have been out of CONTROL.
