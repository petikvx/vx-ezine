Intro
=====

Let me introduce you to the AT&T Definity System 75/85.  This communications
system is a product of the merging of the AT&T System 75 and System 85
architectures.  The name Definity came from the two words "definitive" and
"infinity".

Let me also tell you that there are many different communications systems
out there. (Merlins, AT&Ts) Many many many, I couldn't name them all, but
the AT&T systems are nice.  I enjoy working with them, and I hope you enjoy
this text file.

This System is an advanced business communications system.  A Digital
Communications Protocol (DCP) allows data communication through data
terminal equipment connected to the digital switch.  This allows the
system to handle data and voice communications simultaneously.

The System can handle up to 1600 lines that supports all digital, hybrid,
and analog terminals and equipment.  Up to 400 trunks, and up to 400
Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) Agents.  The Data switching capacity is up
to 800 digital data endpoints, and 160 integrated and combined pooled modem
facilities.

  ~ 510D Personal Terminal or 515-Type Business Communications Terminal
  ~ 7404D Terminals
  ~ 7406D or 7407D Equipped with optional Data Module Base
  ~ Asynchronous Data Units (ADU) (DCE type device that has rs232c interface)
  ~ Digital Terminal Data Modules
  ~ 3270 Data Modules
  ~ Internal Data Channels
  ~ Trunk Data Modules (Modular)
  ~ Processor Data Modules (Modular)

==========
Networking
==========

The Processor Port Network (PPN) always provides the switch processing
element (SPE) and port circuits.  An Expansion Port Network (EPN) is
available to increase line size of any system by allowing you to add
additional port circuits.  The EPN connects to the PPN over a fiber
optic cable that may be up to 1.86 miles remotely situated.  It may also
by located adjacent to the PPN.

This System may be arranged stand-alone or you can integrate it into a
private network.  You can form these types of Networks:
        ~ Tandem Tie Trunk Network (TTTN)
        ~ Electronic Tandem Network (ETN)
        ~ Main/Satellite Configuration
        ~ Distributed Communications System (DCS)
        ~ Centralized Attendant Service (CAS)

An Integrated Services Digital Network Primary Rate Interface (ISDN-PRI)
makes it possible for the Definity System to access various private and
public network services.  With ISDN-PRI the you can access these services:
        ~ Call by Call Service Selection
        ~ Private Network Services
        ~ Information Forwarding
        ~ Call Identification Display
          - Connected Number Display
          - Connected Party Name Display
          - Calling and Called Number Record Display
          - Calling and Called Party Name Display

=============
Configuration
=============

The Actual System is encased in a pair of "cabinets" which have a fiber
optic link between them.  It is also common to have a stack of about three
"cabinets" of a smaller size, for different models.

Shown here is a typical multi-carrier system with a Processor Port Network
(PPN) cabinet and Expansion Port Network (EPN) cabinet.

Management Features
===================

There are a lot of voice features and services, in fact, too many to list, I
will do a run down on all the interesting and useful features and services.
It has many Voice Management, Data Management, Network Services, System
Management, Hospitality Services, and Call Management Services.

              administered, AT&T claims that the customer is responsible for
              all security items, and secure system from unauthorized users,
              and that all users should be aware of handling access codes.

=====================
System Administration
=====================

The "Access Code" you will encounter on these systems is a 1, 2, or 3 digit
number. The pound (#) and star (*) keys can be used as the first digit of the
code.  Below you will see a typical Screen Format taken from one of my logs,
information aside you can see and get a feel of what the administration side of
the system is like.                                                                            Page 1 of 4

System Maintenance
==================

Finally the Maintenance section, where you can see where the errors are
logged, where all the alarms are sent, printed, etc.

There are 3 different types of alarms:
  console or INADS)

The Error log is reported and can be viewed at The Manager Terminal,
as well as the alarm log.
