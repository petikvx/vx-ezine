                                 Introduction
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
      There are many types of different voice mail systems out there, that
run on phone systems they are compatible with.  You have probably seen a lot
of text files about hacking voice mail systems, on your local bulletin
boards.  The popular ones you might have heard about are systems like, Aspen
(Automatic Speech Exchange Network), TMC (The Message Center), Audix, and
Meridian Mail.  There are VMB hacking programs that are suppose to hack vmbs
for you.  I really don't believe in those kind of programs.  When I say this,
I am not talking about programs like Tone Locator or Blue Beep, I am talking
about programs like 'The Aspen Hacker' and any other *VMB* hacking programs.
I am just saying this, so you don't mix this guide up with a vmb hacking
program.

                             General Information
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     I have decided to write a hacking/user's guide for the StarTalk Voice
Mail System because there is no guide for the StarTalk Voice Mail System,
and almost no one has heard about it.  Since this will be the first one for
it, I will try and explain it as simply as possible.  You might have heard
of Northern Telecom.  They are the makers of StarTalk, but they are also the
makers of a very popular user-friendly Voice Mail System called 'Meridian
Mail'.  Both StarTalk and Meridian Mail run on the Norstar telephone system.
StarTalk is designed to function as an extension of the Norstar telephone
system.  All the StarTalk software operation is done on a Norstar telephone
set, so that means it doesn't run on a computer terminal.  There are 3
different sizes and configurations that the StarTalk Voice Mail System
comes with -

 o Model 110 - 2 voice channels, with 1 hour and 50
               minutes total storage.

 o Model 165 - 4 voice channels, with 2 hours and 45
               minutes total storage.

 o Model 385 - 4 voice channels, with 6 hours and 25
               minutes total storage.
               The capabilities of StarTalk Model 385
               can be further expanded through an
               enhancement option, available in 4, 6
               or 8 channel versions, which provides
               a total of 9 hours an 45 minutes of
               storage.

     Right now, you might be wondering what the hell i'm talking about, but
it's simple.  The number of voice channels means how many voice mail users
could be using their voice mail.  So for example, 4 voice channels, means only
4 voice mail users could be on the voice mail system.  The Model 110 can hold
about 25 boxes, the Model 165 can hold 50 boxes and the Model 385 can hold 120
boxes and higher.  So, it's better if you find a StarTalk Voice Mail System
that is running Model 385.  The part that says 'with 6 hours and 25 minutes
total storage', means how many hours of messages it can store.  The Model 385
is also upgradable.  I could go on about the models but that's all we need to
know for now.  So now that we've finished this, we will get into the part
that you've been waiting for.

                     Finding a StarTalk Voice Mail System
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     You will probably not be able to recognize a StarTalk voice mail system
if you find one using a war dialer, because when a StarTalk system answers,
it will only have the company's personalized automated greeting.  There are
only two ways to get a StarTalk system:  you either scan it out yourself or
get it from someone else.  If you get it from someone else, all the boxes
will probably be gone, used or just not safe.

                   Recognizing a StarTalk Voice Mail System
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Ok, now let's say you have come across a StarTalk system, how do you
know that it's a StarTalk?  As I said, you will not be able to tell if it's a
StarTalk system by just calling it.  If the system is a Startalk, when the
company's personalized greeting answers, press '*' and it should say -

"Please enter the mailbox number, or press the # sign to use the directory"

Remember, if you press '*' and just sit there, it will repeat the message
one more `time, and then say "Exiting the system."

If you hit '**' it should say -

"Please enter your mailbox number and your password, then press # sign"

If you don't get anything like this, that means it's not a StarTalk Voice
Mail System.  If you are still not sure that you have a StarTalk System,
then you can always call 416-777-2020 and listen to the voice and see
if it matches with what you have found.

                           Finding a Virgin Box
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     This is a very interesting step and also an easy one.  Once you have
found a StarTalk Voice Mail System, the first thing you'll want to do is
get some boxes on it.  The interesting part is that you are always guaranteed
to get one box on a StarTalk System.  This is because every StarTalk System
has a box that is for the voice mail users to leave any problems they are
experiencing with their vmb.  This is the box that almost always has a default
on it, but if the System Admin is smart he will change it.  So far, on all the
StarTalk systems that I have come across the default for this box hasn't been
changed.  The box number is '101' and the defaults for StarTalk Voice Mail
systems are '0000'.  So the first thing you should do is call up the system
and press *101 and the default greeting on the box should say (this greeting
is for box 101 only) -

"This is the Trouble-Report mailbox, if you are experiencing difficulty
 using the messaging features, please leave your name, mailbox # and a
 detailed description of the problem" *BEEP*

If it says that, press '**' and then when it asks you to enter your mailbox
number and your password, enter '1010000' and press the # sign.  If you've
followed everything I've said and the System Admin hasn't changed the
default on this box, it should go ahead and ask you to enter your new
personal mailbox password.  There is another box number which is sometimes
at the default which is the System Admin's box at 102.  Although this is a
System Admin box, the only System Admin option it has available is to leave
a broadcast message, which leaves a message to all boxes on the system.
This box will have the regular default greeting which is -

"This mailbox is not initialized and cannot accept messages, please
 try again later"

Do the same thing you did before, If it says that, press '**' and then when
it asks you to enter your mailbox number and your password, enter '1020000'
and press the # sign.  If everything is fine, it should ask you to enter your
new personal mailbox password.  This is called Initializing your mailbox, and
I'll talk about this later in this file.  So, there you go, you've got your
box on a StarTalk System.  All StarTalk Voice Mail Systems that I have run
into so far have had 2-3 digit mailboxes.  Now, to hack any other boxes
through the system, you would have to go and keep on trying 3 digit mailbox
number starting with 1XX, until you find an empty box with a regular default
greeting.  Let's say you find another empty box at box number 130, you will do
the same thing, press '**' and when it asks you to enter your mailbox number
and your password, enter '1300000' and press the # sign.  One thing I like
about box number '101' is that, a lot of System Admin's are not aware that it
even exists, that is because they probably have a lousy TSR (Technical Service
Rep).  (This is the person that is suppose to help them install the Voice
Mail System.)

            What to do After you've Got A StarTalk Voice Mail Box
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The rest of the file will concentrate on all the inside functions and
options that a StarTalk Voice Mail Box has.  We will be covering all
these topics -

by the System Admin (don't reply to them!), and also tells you how many other
messages are in your mailbox.  Messages are played beginning with any Urgent
messages, followed by the first message left in your mailbox.

To listen to messages, you must open your mailbox.  Once you have opened
your mailbox:

1.  To listen to messages, press 2 or to listen to your saved messages,
    press 6

Your first message starts to play.  While listening to a message, or after
a message has played, you can:

 Ok, this is the end of the StarTalk voice mail guide.  I tried my best
 to make it as simple as I could with respect to both hacking it
 and using it.  I plan on writing my next file on Smooth Operator, a
 PC-based information processing system.  I will probably focus more on
 the terminal part of it.  I will try and cover the logins and all other
 things needed to get around the system.  If any readers out there have
 comments or suggestions on this article, or on my next article, please
 contact me.
