4.22 TRANSACTION AMOUNT

This is a variable field from three to twelve digits in length.  The transaction
amount includes the amount in 4.28, Secondary Amount.  Therefore, field 4.22
must be greater than or equal to field 4.28.

The transaction amount is presented by the terminal with an implied decimal
point.  For example $.01 would be represented in the record as "001".  When the
terminal is used with an authorization system which supports the US dollar as
the primary currency, the amount field must be limited to seven digits
(9999999). [...]  The terminal may be used with authorization system which
support other currencies that require the full twelve-digit field.

5.07 APPROVAL CODE

This field contains a six-character code when a transaction has been approved.
If the transaction is not approved the contents of the field should be ignored.
The approval code is input to the data capture detail transaction record.

5.08 LOCAL TRANSACTION DATE

This field contains a six-digit local date calculated (MMDDYY) by the
authorization center using the time zone differential code provided in the
authorization request message.  This date is used by the terminal as the date to
be printed on the transaction receipts and audit reports, and as the date input
to the data capture transaction detail record.  This field is only valid for
approved transactions.

5.09 AUTHORIZATION RESPONSE MESSAGE

This field is a sixteen-character field containing a response display message.
This message is used by the terminal to display the authorization results.
Table 5.06 provides the message summary.   The messages are provided with "sp"
space fill.  This field is mapped to the RESPONSE CODE, field 5.06, for all
non-AVS transactions and for all DECLINED AVS transactions.  For APPROVED AVS
transactions (response code = "00" or "85"), it is mapped to the AVS RESULT
CODE, field 5.10.

5.10 AVS RESULT CODE

This one-character field contains the address verification result code.  An
address verification result code is provided for transactions and provides an
additional indication that the card is being used by the person to which the
card was issued.  The service is only available for mail/phone order
transactions.

Table 5.06 provides a summary of the AVS Result Codes.

An ANSI X3.4 "0" is provided for all non-AVS transactions and all declined
transactions.

5.11 TRANSACTION IDENTIFIER

This numeric field will contain a transaction identifier.  The identifier will
be fifteen-digits in length if the payment service indicator value is an "A" or
it will be zero in length if the payment service indicator value is not an "A".
This value is stored in the batch detail record for terminals that capture and
is mandatory for REPS qualification.

5.12 FIELD SEPARATOR

The authorization record format specifies the use of the "FS" character.

5.13 VALIDATION CODE

This alphanumeric field will contain a validation code.  The code will contain a
four-character value if the payment service indicator value is an "A" or it will
be zero in length if the payment service indicator value is not an "A".  This
value is stored in the batch detail record for terminals that capture and is
mandatory for REPS qualification.

5.14 FIELD SEPARATOR

The authorization record format specifies the use of the "FS" character.

5.15 NETWORK IDENTIFICATION CODE

This one-character fixed length field contains the identification code of the
network on which the transaction was authorized.  The network ID must be printed
on the receipt.

5.16 SETTLEMENT DATE

This four-digit fixed length field contains the transaction settlement date
returned by the authorizing system (MMDD).  The settlement date must be printed
on the receipt.

5.17 SYSTEM TRACE AUDIT NUMBER

This six-character fixed length field contains a trace audit number which is
assigned by the authorizing system.  The trace audit number must be printed on
the receipt.

5.18 RETRIEVAL REFERENCE NUMBER

This twelve-character fixed length field contains the transaction retrieval
reference number returned by the authorizing system.  The reference number
should be printed on the receipt.

5.19 LOCAL TRANSACTION TIME

This six-digit fixed length field contains the transaction time returned by the
authorizing system (HHMMSS).  The time must be printed on the receipt.

6.0 CONFIRMATION RECORD DATA ELEMENT DEFINITIONS

The following subsections define the debit confirmation response record data
elements.

6.01 NETWORK IDENTIFICATION CODE

This one character fixed length field contains the identification code of the
network on which the transaction was authorized.  The network ID is printed on
the receipt.

6.02 SETTLEMENT DATE

This four-digit fixed length field contains the transaction settlement date
returned by the authorizing system.

6.03 SYSTEM TRACE AUDIT NUMBER

This six-character fixed length field contains the system trace audit number
which is assigned by the authorizing system.

7.0 CHARACTER CODE DEFINITIONS

The following subsections will define the authorization request record character
set and character sets used for track 1 and track 2 data encoded on the magnetic
stripes.

The authorization request records are generated with characters defined by ANSI
X3.4-1986.  The data stored on the cardholder's card in magnetic or optical form
must be converted to the ANSI X3.4 character set before transmission to VisaNet.

Section 7.01 provides track 1 character set definition.  Section 7.02 provides
track 2 character set definition.  Section 7.03 provides the ANSI X3.4-1986 and
ISO 646 character set definitions.  Section 7.04 provides a cross reference
between the track 1, track 2, and ANSI X3.4 character sets.  Section 7.05
describes the method for generating and checking the Mod 10 Luhn check digit for
credit card account numbers.  Section 7.06 describes the method for generating
the LRC byte for the authorization request message and for testing the card
swipe's LRC byte.  Section 7.07 provides sample data for an authorization
request and response for record format "J" testing.

The POS device/authorization must perform the following operations on track
read data before it can be used in an authorization request message.

   1. The LRC must be calculated for the data read from the track and compared
      to the LRC read from the track.  The track data is assumed to be read
      without errors when on character parity errors are detected and the
      calculated and read LRC's match.

   2. The starting sentinel, ending sentinel, and LRC are discarded.

   3. The character codes read from the magnetic stripe must be converted from
      the encoded character set to the set used for the authorization request
      message.  The characters encoded on track 1 are six-bit plus parity codes
      and the characters encoded on track 2 are four-bit plus parity codes, with
      the character set used for the request message defined as seven-bit plus
      parity codes.

All characters read from a track must be converted to the request message
character set and transmitted as part of the request.  The converted track data
can not be modified by adding or deleting non-framing characters and must be a
one-for-one representation of the characters read from the track.  [sounds like
they mean it, eh?]

7.1 TRACK 1 CHARACTER DEFINITION

Table 7.01 provides the ISO 7811-2 track 1 character encoding definitions.  This
"standards" format is a SAMPLE guideline for expected credit card track
encoding; ATM/debit cards may differ.  Actual cards may differ [not], whether
they are Visa cards or any other issuer's cards.

Each character is defined by the six-bit codes listed in Table 7.01.

Track 1 can be encoded with up to 79 characters as shown in Figure 7.01

7.06 CALCULATING AN LRC

When creating or testing the LRC for the read of the card swipe, the
authorization request record, the debit confirmation record or the VisaNet
response record; use the following steps to calculate the LRC:

1) The value of each bit in the LRC character, excluding the parity bit, is
   defined such that the total count of ONE bits encoded in the corresponding
   bit location of all characters of the data shall be even (this is also known
   as an EXCLUSIVE OR (XOR) operation)

      For card swipes, include the start sentinel, all the data read and
      the end sentinel.

      For VisaNet protocol messages, begin with the first character past
      the STX, up to and including the ETX.

2) The LRC characters parity bit is not a parity bit for the individual parity
   bits of the data message, but it only the parity bit for the LRC character
   itself.  Calculated as an even parity bit.

[ i list a routine for calculating an LRC o a string later on in the document ]

                                [ section two ]
                              [ finding visanet ]

finding visanet isn't hard, but it can be tedious.  visanet rents time off of
compuserve and X.25 networks.  the compuserve nodes used are not the same
as their information service, cis.  to identify a visanet dialup after
connecting, watch for three enq characters and a three second span to hangup.
if you've scanned out a moderate portion of your area code, you probably have a
few dialups.  one idea is to write a short program to dial all the connects you
have marked as garbage or worthless [ you did keep em, right? ]  and wait
for the proper sequence.  X.25 connections should work similarly, but i don't
know for sure.  read the section on visanet usage for other dialup sources.

                                [ section three ]
                        [ visanet link level protocol ]

messages to/from visanet have a standard format:

    stx - message - etx - lrc

the message portion is the record formats covered in section one.  lrc values
are calculated starting with the first byte of message, going up to and
including the etx character.  heres an algorithm that calculates the lrc for a
string. note: in order to work with the visanet protocols, append etx to the
string before calling this function.

unsigned char func_makelrc(char *buff)
{
   int i;
   char ch, *p;

   ch = 0;
   p = buff;

   for(;;)  {
      ch = (ch^(*p));
      p++;
      if(!(*p))
         break;
   }

   return ch;
}

for a single authorization exchange, the easiest kind of transaction, the
sequence goes like this:

host   enq                   stx-response-etx-lrc   eot
term      stx-request-etx-lrc                    ack
                                                          <disconnect>

matching this sequence with test record formats from section one, 7.07, heres
an ascii representation of a transaction.  control characters denoted in <>'s.
[of course, you wouldn't really have a carriage return in middle of a message.
duh. ]  this transaction would be for card number 4444111122223333 with an
expiration date of 04/96.  the purchase amount is $1.23.  visanet responds with
an approval code of 12ab45.

host: <enq>

term: <stx>J0.401205123456789012000100015999840945461085412345678Y0001@H444411
      1122223333<fs>0496<fs>0000123<fs>ER<fs><fs>000<fs><etx><lrc>

host: <stx>Y00010001500010012AB45111992APPROVAL 12AB45123456789012345<fs>
      ABCD<fs><etx><lrc>

term: <ack>

host: <eot>

authorizing multiple transactions during one connect session is only slightly
more complicated.  the etx character on all messages sent to visanet are changed
to etb and the application type is changed from '0' to '2' [section one 4.02].
instead of responding after a transaction with eot, visanet instead polls the
terminal again with enq.  this continues until the terminal either changes back
to the single transaction format or issues an eot to the host.

heres a short list of all control characters used:

stx: start-of-text, first message framing character signaling message start
etx: end-of-text, the frame ending character the last message of a sequence
eot: end-of-transmission, used to end an exchange and signal disconnect
enq: enquiry, an invitation to transmit a message or retransmit last item
ack: affirmative acknowledgment, follows correct reception of message
nak: negative acknowledgment, used to indicate that the message was not
     understood or was received with errors
syn: delay character, wait thirty seconds
etb: end-of-block, the end framing character used to signal the end of a message
     within a multiple message sequence

other quick notes: visanet sometimes sends ack before stx on responses
                   lrc characters can hold any value, such as stx, nak, etc
                   visanet can say goodbye at any time by sending eot
                   people can get very anal about error flow diagrams

                                [ section four ]
                    [ half the story; central data capture ]

a full transaction requires two steps, one of which is described in this
document: getting the initial authorization.  an authorization does basically
nothing to a person's account.  oh, you could shut somebody's account down for
a day or two by requesting a twenty thousand dollar authorization, but no other
ill effects would result.  central data capture, the second and final step in a
transaction, needs information from both the authorization request and
response, which is used to generate additional data records.  these records are
then sent to visanet by the merchant in a group, usually at the end of each day.

                                [ section five ]
                            [ common applications ]

access to visanet can be implemented in a number of ways: directly on a pos
terminal, indirectly via a lan, in a hardware specific device, or any
permutation possible to perform the necessary procedures.  card swipers commonly
seen at malls are low tech, leased at around fifty dollars per month, per
terminal.  they have limited capacity, but are useful in that all of the
information necessary for transactions is self contained.  dr delam and maldoror
found this out, and were delighted to play the role of visanet in fooling the
little device.  close scrutiny of section one reveals atm formats, phone order
procedures, and new services such as direct debit from checking/savings and
checks by phone.  start noticing the stickers for telecheck and visa atm cards,
and you're starting to get the picture.

this article written to thank previous Phrack writers...
please thank me appropriately...
800#s exist...
other services exist... mastercard runs one...
never underestimate the power of asking nicely...
numerous other formats are available... see section one, 3.0 for hints...
never whistle while you're pissing...
