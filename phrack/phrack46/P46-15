1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document describes the request and response record formats for the VisaNet
second generation Point-Of-Sale (POS) authorization terminals and VisaNet
Authorization services.  This document describes only record formats.  Other
documents describe communication protocols and POS equipment processing
requirements.  Figure 1.0 represents the authorization request which is
transmitted to VisaNet using public communication services and the
authorization response returned by VisaNet.  Debit transactions include a
third confirmation message.

This document describes the record formats to be used for the development of
new applications.  Current formats or transition formats will be provided on
request.  The usage of some fields have changed with the new record formats.
Applications which were developed to previous specifications will continue to
be supported by VisaNet services.  The new formats and field usage is provided
with the intention of moving all new applications developed to the new formats.

3.0 AUTHORIZATION RECORD FORMATS

This section contains the record formats for the authorization request,
response and confirmation records.  The ANSI X3.4 character set is used to
represent all record data elements.  (See Section 7)

In the record formats on the following pages, the column heading FORMAT is
defined as:

"NUM"  represents numeric data, the numbers 0 through 9, NO SPACES.
"A/N"  represents alphanumeric data, the printing character set.
"FS"   represents a field separator character as defined in ANSI X3.4 as
       a "1C" hex

3.01 REQUEST RECORD FORMAT

Table 3.01b provides the record format for the authorization request records.
Section 4 provides the data element definitions.

The authorization request record is a variable length record.  The record
length will depend on the source of the customer data and the type of
authorization request.  Refer to Table 3.01c to determine which GROUPS to use
from Table 3.01a

TABLE 3.01a IS PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE REASONS ONLY.  ALL NEW APPLICATIONS
            SHOULD USE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RECORD FORMATS:

RECORD  | APPLICATION |
FORMAT  |    TYPE     | REMARKS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   J    |   CREDIT    | All non-ATM card transactions (Visa cards, other credit
        |             | cards, private label credit cards and check guarantee)
   G    | DIAL DEBIT  | Visa supported ATM debit cards

The selection of format type J and G or any other value from Table 3.01a will
depend on the VisaNet services that are desired.  Contact your Visa POS member
support representative for assistance in determining the required formats.

NOTE (for TRANSACTION CODE = 95)
--------------------------------
    - For Interlink Debit CANCEL request message, all of the fields in
      Groups I and II will come from the original transaction request or the
      original transaction response, with the exception of the following:
         - The AUTHORIZATION TRANSACTION CODE will need to be changed to the
           Debit CANCEL code.
         - The TRANSACTION SEQUENCE NUMBER should be incremented in the
           normal fashion.
         - The CUSTOMER DATA FIELD and the CARDHOLDER IDENTIFICATION DATE
           (PIN) will need to be re-entered.

4.13 TERMINAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

This field contains an eight-digit code that must be greater than zero, defined
by the terminal down line load support organization.  Support may be provided by
the Visa's Merchant Assistance Center (MAC), the signing member, or a third
party organization.  The terminal ID is used to uniquely identify the terminal
in the terminal support system and identification for the VisaNet Central Data
Capture (CDC).  The terminal ID may not be unique within the VisaNet system.
Each terminal support provider and member that provides its own terminal support
can assign potentially identical terminal IDs within its system.  The terminal
ID can be used by the terminal down line load system to access the terminal
application and parameter data from a system data base when down line loading a
terminal. [huh?]

NOTE: It is recommended that [the] Terminal ID Number should be unique within
the same Acquirer's BIN.

NOTE:
   - If a dual track reading terminal is being used, be sure to enter the
     correct value of "D" or "H" for the magnetic data that is transmitted
   - When data is manually keyed at a dual track reading terminal, enter either
     a "T" or an "X"

4.18 CUSTOMER DATA FIELD

This is a variable length field containing customer account or check acceptance
ID data in one of three formats.  The cardholder account information can be read
d from the card or it may be entered manually.  Additionally the terminal can be
used for check authorization processing with the check acceptance identification
number entered by the operator for transmission in this field.

NOTE: For all POS terminals operated under VISA U.S.A. Operating Regulations,
the following requirement must be available as an operating option if the
merchant location is found to be generating a disproportionately high percentage
of Suspect Transactions [lets get downright hostile about it] as defined in
chapter 9.10 of the VISA U.S.A. Operating Regulations.  Specifically, chapter
9.10.B.2 requires that:

   - The terminal must read the track data using a magnetic stripe reading
     terminal
   - The terminal must prompt the wage slave to manually enter the last four
     digits of the account number
   - The terminal must compare the keyed data with the last four digits of the
     account number in the magnetic stripe
   - If the compare is successful, the card is acceptable to continue in the
     authorization process and the terminal must transmit the full, unaltered
     contents of the magnetic stripe in the authorization message.
   - If the compare fails, the card should not be honored at the Point of Sale

4.18.1 TRACK 1 READ DATA

This is a variable length field with a maximum data length of 76 characters.

The track 1 data read from the cardholder's card is checked for parity and LRC
errors and then converted from the six-bit characters encoded on the card to
seven-bit characters as defined in ANSI X3.4.  The character set definitions are
provided in section 7 for reference.  As part of the conversion the terminal
will strip off the starting sentinel, ending sentinel, and LRC characters.  The
separators are to be converted to a "^" (HEX 5E) character.  The entire
track must be provided in the request message.  The character set and data
content are different between track 1 and track 2.  The data read by a track 2
device can not be correctly reformatted and presented as though it were read by
a track 1 device.  [aw shucks]  The converted data can not be modified by adding
or deleting non-framing characters and must be a one-for-one representation of
the character read from the track.

4.18.2 TRACK 2 READ DATA

This is a variable length field with a maximum data length of 37 characters.

The track 2 data read from the cardholder's card is checked for parity and LRC
errors and then converted from the six-bit characters encoded on the card to
seven-bit characters as defined in ANSI X3.4.  The character set definitions are
provided in section 7 for reference.  As part of the conversion the terminal
will strip off the starting sentinel, ending sentinel, and LRC characters.  The
separators are to be converted to a  "^" (HEX 5E) character.  The entire
track must be provided in the request message.  The character set and data
content are different between track 2 and track 1.  The data read by a track 1
device can not be correctly reformatted and presented as though it were read by
a track 2 device.  The converted data can not be modified by adding or deleting
non-framing characters and must be a one-for-one representation of the character
read from the track. [repetitive? you bet]

4.18.3 MANUALLY ENTERED ACCOUNT DATA (CREDIT CARD)

The customer credit card data may be key entered when the card can not be read,
when a card is not present, or when a card reader is not available.

4.18.3.1 MANUALLY ENTERED ACCOUNT NUMBER

This is a variable length field consisting of 5 to 28 alphanumeric characters.

The embossed cardholder data, that is key entered, is validated by the terminal
using rules for each supported card type.  For example, both Visa and Master
Card include a mod 10 check digit as the last digit of the Primary Account
Number.  The Primary Account Number (PAN) is encoded as seven-bit characters
as defined in ANSI X3.4.  The PAN is then provided in the manually entered
record format provided in Table 3.01b.  The PAN must be provided without
embedded spaces.

4.18.3.2 MANUALLY ENTERED EXPIRATION DATE

This four-digit field contains the card expiration date in the form MMYY (month-
month-year-year)

4.18.4 CHECK ACCEPTANCE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER

The customer data may be card read or manually key entered for check acceptance
transactions.

4.18.4.1 CHECK ACCEPTANCE ID

This field is a variable length field consisting of 1 to 28 alphanumeric
characters.  The check acceptance vendor will provide the data format and
validation rules to be used by the terminal.  Typically the ID consists of a
two-digit state code and an ID which may be the customer's drivers license
number.

4.18.4.2 MANUALLY ENTERED CHECK ACCEPTANCE DATA

This six-character field contains the customer birth date or a control code in
the form specified by the check acceptance processor.

4.19 FIELD SEPARATOR

The authorization record format specifies the use of the "FS" character.

4.20 CARDHOLDER IDENTIFICATION DATA

This field will be 0, 23, 29 or 32 characters in length.  The cardholder ID
codes shown in Table 4.16 indicates the type of data in this field.  Table
4.20 provides a brief summary of the current formats.

4.20.1 STATIC KEY WITH TWENTY THREE BYTE CARDHOLDER ID

NOTE: The 23 byte static key technology is NOT approved for use in terminals
deployed in the Visa U.S.A. region.  [thanks nsa!]

When a PIN is entered on a PIN pad supporting 23 byte static key technology, the
terminal will generate the following data:

   1JFxxyyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

   Where:
        1J   Header - PIN was entered

        f    Function Key Indicator - A single byte indicating which, if any,
             function key was pressed on the PIN pad.  This field is currently
             not edited.  Any printable character is allowed.

        xx   PIN Block Format - These two numeric bytes indicate the PIN
             encryption method used to create the encrypted PIN block.  Visa
             currently supports four methods; 01, 02, 03, & 04.  For more
             information, please refer to the VisaNet Standards Manual, Card
             Technology Standards, PIN and Security Standards, Section 2,
             Chapter 3, PIN Block Formats

        aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa   Expanded Encrypted PIN Block Data - The encrypted
             PIN block format consists of 64 bits of data.  Since the VisaNet
             Second Generation protocol allows only printable characters in
             data fields, these 64 bits must be expanded to ensure that no
             values less than hex "20" are transmitted.  To expand the 64 bit
             encrypted PIN block, remove four bits at a time and convert them
             to ANSI X3.4 characters using Table 4.20.  After this conversion,
             the 64 bit encrypted PIN block will consist of 16 characters that
             will be placed in the Expanded Encrypted PIN Block Data field.

4.20.2 STATIC KEY WITH THIRTY TWO BYTE CARDHOLDER ID

When a PIN is entered on a PIN pad supporting 32 byte static key technology,
the terminal will generate the following data:

       aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa2001ppzz00000000

      Where:
         aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa - Expanded Encrypted PIN Block Data - The encrypted
              PIN block format consists of 64 bits of data.  Since the
              VisaNet Second Generation protocol allows only printable
              characters in data fields, these 64 bits must be expanded to
              ensure that no values less than hex "20" are transmitted.  To
              expand the 64 bit encrypted PIN block, remove four bits at a
              time and convert them to ANSI X3.4 characters using table 4.20.
              After this conversion, the 64 bit encrypted PIN block will
              consist of 16 characters that will be placed in the Expanded
              Encrypted PIN Block Data field.

         20 - Security Format Code - This code defines that the Zone
              Encryption security technique was used.

         01 - PIN Encryption Algorithm Identifier - This code defines that the
              ANSI DES encryption technique was used.

         pp - PIN Block Format Code - This code describes the PIN block format
              was used by the acquirer.  Values are:
                 01 - Format is based on the PIN, the PIN length, selected
                      rightmost digits of the account number and the pad
                      characters "0" and "F"; combined through an exclusive
                      "OR" operation.
                 02 - Format is based on the PIN, the PIN length and a user
                      specified numeric pad character.
                 03 - Format is based on the PIN and the "F" pad character.
                 04 - Format is the same as "01" except that the leftmost
                      account number digits are selected.

         zz - Zone Key Index - This index points to the zone key used by the
              acquirer to encrypt the PIN block.  Values are:
                 01 - First key
                 02 - Second key

         00000000 - Visa Reserved - Must be all zeros

For additional information, refer to the VisaNet manual V.I.P. System, Message
Formats, Section B: Field Descriptions.  Specifically, fields 52 and 53;
Personal Identification Number (PIN) Data and Security Related Control
Information respectively.

4.20.3 DUK/PT KEY WITH THIRTY TWO BYTE CARDHOLDER ID

When a PIN is entered on a PIN pad supporting DUK/PT technology, the terminal
will generate the following 32 bytes:

     aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaakkkkkkssssssssss

     Where:
         aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa - Expanded Encrypted PIN Block Data - The encrypted
              PIN block format consists of 64 bits of data.  Since the
              VisaNet Second Generation protocol allows only printable
              characters in data fields, these 64 bits must be expanded to
              ensure that no values less than hex "20" are transmitted.  To
              expand the 64 bit encrypted PIN block, remove four bits at a
              time and convert them to ANSI X3.4 characters using table 4.20.
              After this conversion, the 64 bit encrypted PIN block will
              consist of 16 characters that will be placed in the Expanded
              Encrypted PIN Block Data field.  [repetitive? you bet]

         kkkkkk - Key Set Identifier (KSID) - Is represented by a unique, Visa
              Visa assigned, six digit bank identification number.

         ssssssssss - Expanded TRSM ID (PIN Pad Serial Number) & Expanded
              Transaction Counter - Is represented by the concatenation of these
              two hexadecimal fields.  The PIN pad serial number is stored as
              five hex digits minus one bit for a total of 19 bits of data.  The
              transaction counter is stored as five hex digits plus one bit for
              a total of 21 bits of data.  These two fields concatenated
              together will contain 40 bits.  Since the VisaNet Second
              Generation protocol allows only printable characters in data
              fields, these 40 bits must be expanded to ensure that no values
              less than hex "20" are transmitted.  To expand this 40 bit field,
              remove four bits at a time and convert them to ASCII characters
              using table 4.20.  After this conversion, this 40 bit field will
              consist of 10 characters that will be placed in the Expanded
              TRSM ID & Expanded Transaction Counter Field.
