  ISBN: 1-55950-106-5

        The Knightmare is no super hacker.  There is little or no real

        like telling you not to dress up before going trashing.
        The Knightmare's best hack is fooling Loompanics into
        publishing this garbage.

14. What are some organizations of interest to hackers?

Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CPSR empowers computer professionals and computer users to advocate
for the responsible use of information technology and empowers all who
use computer technology to participate in the public debate.   As
technical experts, CPSR members provide the public and policymakers
with realistic assessments of the power, promise, and limitations of
computer technology.  As an organization of concerned citizens, CPSR
directs public attention to critical choices concerning the
applications of computing and how those choices affect society.

By matching unimpeachable technical information with policy
development savvy, CPSR uses minimum dollars to have maximum impact
and encourages broad public participation in the shaping of technology
policy.

Every project we undertake is based on five principles:

*  We foster and support public discussion of and public
   responsibility for decisions involving the use of computers in
   systems critical to society.

*  We work to dispel popular myths about the infallibility of
   technological systems.

*  We challenge the assumption that technology alone can solve
   political and social problems.

*  We critically examine social and technical issues within the
   computer profession, nationally and internationally.

*  We encourage the use of computer technology to improve the quality
   of life.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is dedicated to the pursuit
of policies and activities that will advance freedom and openness in
computer-based communications. It is a member-supported, nonprofit
group that grew from the conviction that a new public interest
organization was needed in the information age; that this organization
would enhance and protect the democratic potential of new computer
communications technology. From the beginning, the EFF determined to
become an organization that would combine technical, legal, and public
policy expertise, and would apply these skills to the myriad issues
and concerns that arise whenever a new communications medium is born.

The League for Programming Freedom (LPF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The League for Programming Freedom is an organization of people who
oppose the attempt to monopolize common user interfaces through "look
and feel" copyright lawsuits.  Some of us are programmers, who worry
that such monopolies will obstruct our work.  Some of us are users,
who want new computer systems to be compatible with the interfaces we
know.  Some are founders of hardware or software companies, such as
Richard P. Gabriel. Some of us are professors or researchers,
including John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Guy L. Steele, Jr., Robert S.
Boyer and Patrick Winston.

"Look and feel" lawsuits aim to create a new class of government-
enforced monopolies broader in scope than ever before.  Such a system
of user-interface copyright would impose gratuitous incompatibility,
reduce competition, and stifle innovation.

We in the League hope to prevent these problems by preventing
user-interface copyright.  The League is NOT opposed to copyright law
as it was understood until 1986 -- copyright on particular programs.
Our aim is to stop changes in the copyright system which would take
away programmers' traditional freedom to write new programs compatible
with existing programs and practices.

Annual dues for individual members are $42 for employed professionals,
$10.50 for students, and $21 for others.  We appreciate activists, but
members who cannot contribute their time are also welcome.

To contact the League, phone (617) 243-4091, send Internet mail to the

Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CERT is the Computer Emergency Response Team that was formed by the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in November 1988 in
response to the needs exhibited during the Internet worm incident.
The CERT charter is to work with the Internet community to facilitate
its response to computer security events involving Internet hosts, to
take proactive steps to raise the community's awareness of computer
security issues, and to conduct research targeted at improving the
security of existing systems.

CERT products and services include 24-hour technical assistance for
responding to computer security incidents, product vulnerability
assistance, technical documents, and seminars.  In addition, the team
maintains a number of mailing lists (including one for CERT
advisories) and provides an anonymous FTP server:  cert.org
(192.88.209.5), where security-related documents, past CERT
advisories, and tools are archived.

Section D: 2600
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01. What is alt.2600?

Alt.2600 is a Usenet newsgroup for discussion of material relating to
2600 Magazine, the hacker quarterly.   It is NOT for the Atari 2600
game machine.  Len@netsys.com created the group on Emmanuel
Goldstein's recommendation.  Emmanuel is the editor/publisher of 2600
Magazine. Following the barrage of postings about the Atari machine to
alt.2600, an alt.atari.2600 was created to divert all of the atari
traffic from alt.2600.  Atari 2600 people are advised to hie over to
rec.games.video.classic.


02. What does "2600" mean?

	2600Hz was a tone that was used by early phone phreaks (or
phreakers) in the 80's, and some currently.  If the tone was sent down the
line at the proper time, one could get away with all sorts of fun stuff.  

A note from Emmanuel Goldstein:
	
"The Atari 2600 has NOTHING to do with blue boxes or telephones
or the 2600 hertz tone.  The 2600 hertz tone was simply the first
step towards exploring the network.  If you were successful at 
getting a toll call to drop, then billing would stop at that
point but there would be billing for the number already dialed
up until the point of seizure.  800 numbers and long distance
information were both free in the past and records of who called
what were either non-existent or very obscure with regards to
these numbers.  This, naturally, made them more popular than
numbers that showed up on a bill, even if it was only for
a minute.  Today, many 800 numbers go overseas, which provides
a quick and free way into another country's phone system
which may be more open for exploration."


03. Are there on-line versions of 2600 available?

	No.


04. I can't find 2600 at any bookstores.  What can I do?

Subscribe.  Or, let 2600 know via the subscription address that you
think 2600 should be in the bookstore.  Be sure to include the
bookstores name and address.


05. Why does 2600 cost more to subscribe to than to buy at a newsstand?

A note from Emmanuel Goldstein:

  We've been selling 2600 at the same newsstand price ($4) since 1988
  and we hope to keep it at that price for as long as we can get away
  with it. At the same time, $21 is about the right price to cover
  subscriber costs, including postage and record keeping, etc. People
  who subscribe don't have to worry about finding an issue someplace,
  they tend to get issues several weeks before the newsstands get
  them, and they can take out free ads in the 2600 Marketplace.

  This is not uncommon in the publishing industry.  The NY Times, for
  example, costs $156.50 at the newsstands, and $234.75 delivered to your
  door.


Section E: Phrack Magazine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

01. What Is Phrack Magazine?

    Phrack Magazine is one of the longest running electronic-based publications
    in the world.  Originally founded in 1985 by Knight Lightning and Taran
    King, it has survived several incarnations of editors and still remains
    true to its underground roots.  Since its inception, Phrack has been
    providing the hacker community with information on operating systems,
    networking technologies and telephony, as well as relaying human interest
    features of interest to the international computer underground.

    During its lifetime, Phrack has always been at the center of controversy.
    Since the magazine has always been openly available, it presented law
    enforcement officials with what they percieved to be a direct link into
    the secret society of computer hackers.  Not truly understnding either
    the the spirit of the magazine or the community for which it was written,
     Federal Agents and Prosecutors began to target Phrack Magazine and those
    affiliated with it.

    "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling relays the details surrounding
    some of these events.

    Phrack Magazine is now in its 10th year of publication, and is registered
    with the Library of Congress as ISSN 1068-1035, and is protected by
    US Copyright Law.

02. How can I reach Phrack Magazine?

    You can reach Phrack by email at:  phrack@well.com, phrack@fc.net or
    phrackmag@aol.com.  These addresses are listed in order of
    preference.  Only AOL users should email the phrackmag@aol.com.

    Phrack can be reached by the postal service at:

    Phrack Magazine
    603 W. 13th #1A-278
    Austin, TX 78701

03. Who Publishes Phrack?

   Phrack Magazine is published by Chris Goggans, aka Erik Bloodaxe.  It is
   hobbled together, touched up, spell checked and compressed on an overworked
   486-66.  It is then ftp'ed over to a BSDI UNIX machine where it is sent to
   the masses.

04. How Often Does Phrack Go Out?

    Phrack goes out roughly quarterly.  It is often sent out later than every
    three months due to other more demanding obligations faced by its editor.
    The regularity of Phrack is really based upon the amount of information
    sent in.  Phrack depends solely upon submissions to get published at all.

05. How Do I Subscribe?

    To subscribe to Phrack magazine, merely email phrack@well.com and ask to
    be placed on the mailing list.

    Any encrypted subscriptions requests will be ignored.

    Phrack will not accept subscription requests from any anonymous remailers or
    from sites in the fidonet domain.  The anonymous remailers consistently
    bounce our mailings causing a big headache, so we won't use them.  The
    fidonet domain administrators have asked us not to mail Phrack to fido users,
    because of the huge load it places on their outgoing spools (costing them a
    lot of money to send).

06. Why Don't I Get Any Response When I E-mail Phrack?

    Because of the high volume of mail sent to the Phrack email address,
    not everyone gets a response.  All subscription requests are saved and
    added to the master list, but there is no automatic reply.  All other
    messages are responded to as they are read, with the exception of PGP'd
    messages.  All PGP'd email is stored for later decryption, and is almost
    never responded to, unless it is incredibly urgent.

07. Does Phrack Cost Money?

    Phrack Magazine charges a registration fee of $100.00 per user for any
    professional use of the magazine and the information contained therein.
    Information regarding this registration fee is contained at the beginning
    of every issue of Phrack.

08. How Can I Submit Articles?

    Articles are both wanted and needed.  Phrack only exists if people write
    for it.  There is no regular writing staff, there is only the editor, who
    cannot write the entire thing himself.

    Articles can be sent to Phrack via email or snailmail (on paper or
    IBM-compatible diskette).  Articles should be in ASCII text format.  Do
    not include any clever graphics or ANSI art.  You can use Phrack's PGP key
    to encrypt articles, but send the files in the ASCII armor format.

    Please try to avoid sending files as MIME-compliant mail attachments.

10. Where Can I Get Back Issues?

   Back issues of Phrack are found on many bulletin boards around the globe.
   The only OFFICIAL Phrack Magazine distribution site is our ftp archive
   at ftp.fc.net in /pub/phrack.  There are NO official distribution sites
   other than this one, nor will there ever be.  We don't want to play
   favorites and let one particular BBS call itself an "official" site while
   another isn't.  Therefore, there will be no "official" sites except those
   archived by Phrack itself.

   You can also get back issues on the World Wide Web by connecting to:
   http://www.fc.net/phrack.html

   This URL allows users to view issues online, or pull them down for
   later viewing.

   Any users without net access can send diskettes and postage to the
   Phrack Postal Address given above, and request back issues to be
   sent via the postal system.

02. How do I determine if I have a valid credit card number?

Credit cards use the Luhn Check Digit Algorithm.  The main purpose of
this algorithm is to catch data entry errors, but it does double duty
here as a weak security tool.

For a card with an even number of digits, double every odd numbered
digit and subtract 9 if the product is greater than 9.  Add up all the
even digits as well as the doubled-odd digits, and the result must be
a multiple of 10 or it's not a valid card.  If the card has an odd
number of digits, perform the same addition doubling the even numbered
digits instead.

04. What are the ethics of hacking?

An excerpt from: Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution
                          by Steven Levy

        Access to computers -- and anything which might teach you
        something about the way the world works -- should be unlimited
        and total. Always yield to the Hands-On imperative.

        All information should be free.

        Mistrust Authority.  Promote Decentralization.

        Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria
        such as degrees, age, race, or position.

        You can create art and beauty on a computer.

        Computers can change your life for the better.
