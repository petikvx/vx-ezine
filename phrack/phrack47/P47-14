           The Glenayre GL3000 Paging and Voice Retrieval System
                                 by armitage

                                  Welcome
                                  -------
    I am glad you decided to read this article.  This article will explain
the basis of what this system is, show many features, and guide you through
a few basic operations (pager reactivation, and meet-me setup).  This system
is one of many different paging systems, but I have found many scattered
through the nation, so if you are wondering what you can do with all those
carriers found while scanning, compare them to the login screen shown later
in the article.

                                  Summary
                                  -------

    The Glenayre GL3000 paging and voice retrieval system is a fully featured
digital radio paging terminal which also provides integrated voice mailbox
facilities.

    I'm sure this is not important, but so you know, the gl3000 family comes
in 5 different respective sizes (es, s, m, l, and xl).  All of the systems
have same features except the only thing that differs is their bandwidth, and
their capabilities.

    Analog and digital paging formats are supported, it provides for tone only,
voice, numeric, and alphanumeric paging.

                                  Features
                                  --------
Voice Mail Box Features
-----------------------

    The voice mail box feature of the system complements the pager router
system very nicely.  This voice mail system is just like any other, so I
won't go into detail over it.

If you are entering a new subscriber, you want to enter a customer number
that is not being used.  There will be a record number in the top left to
show you which records are being used.  In this example we will use number 1.
So enter the new number and then <RETURN>.  The type CREATE <RETURN> into
the command line.

Glossary of Terms
-----------------

    I have listed some terms you might have trouble with while you are
playing around with this system, this is nowhere near as many as there are,
but the most vital are listed below.

Address - 1. The telephone number dialed by a calling party which identifies
         the party called.  2. A location or destination in a computer
         program.
Bell 103 - The North American standard for 300 bps modems.
Bell 212A - The North American standard for 1200 bps modems.
Blocking - The process of grouping data into transmission blocks. The
         inability of a pabx to service connection requests, usually because
         its switching matrix can only handle a limited number of connections
         simultaneously.  Blocking occurs if a call request from a user
         cannot be handled due to an insufficient number of paths through the
         switching matrix; blocking thus prevents free stations from
         communicating.
Borscht - Acronym for the functions that must be performed in the Central
         office at the subscriber's analog interface of a digital system.
         (battery, overvoltage, ringing, supervision, coding, hybrid, and
         test)
Broadband - A communication system with a large bandwidth.
Channel - Electronic communications path, usually of 4,000 Hz (voice)
         bandwidth.
Crossbar - A type of telephone switch.
Crossbar Switch - (In PABX technology) a switch that has multiple vertical
         paths, multiple horizontal paths, and electromagnetically operated
         mechanical means for connecting any vertical path with any
         horizontal path.  Modern PABXs often use an electronic version of
         the crossbar switch.
Data - In phone systems: any information other than speech or tones.
Data Set - The telephone companies term for a modem.
Decoder - A device that converts information into another form of signals.
         (A DTMF decoder converts dtmf tones to numerical dtmf values)
Dial Long Line - Special Service device which extends loop signalling
         distance.
Digital - Variable as opposed to constant.  Data characters are coded in
         discrete, separate pulses or signal levels.  Contrast with Analog.
Duplex - Simultaneous two-way independent transmissions in both directions.
Echo - A faint return of transmitted data.
ESS - (Electronic Switching System): A telephone switching machine using
         electronics, often combined with electro-mechanical crosspoints,
         and usually with a stored program computer as the control element.
FCC - (Federal Communications Commission): A government agency that monitors
         and regulates all use of the electromagnetic spectrum for
         communications.
Handshake, Handshaking - A preliminary process that is part of a
         communications protocol that establishes a data connection.
Interface - The connection between two separate and distinct mechanical or
         computerized systems.
Interoffice Trunks - Shared facilities connecting CO switches.
Link - A communications circuit.
Local CO - Central office (end office) capable of switching calls between
         local subscriber circuits.
Local Loop - The voice-band channel connecting the subscriber to the central
         office.
Logging - Recording data associated with a system.
Multiplexing - The division of a transmission facility into two or more
         channels.
Network - An interconnection of computer systems, terminals, or data
         communications facilities.
Parameters - Variables designed for system uses.
Port - A computer interface capable of attaching a communication protocol.
PBX or PABX - (Private <Automatic> Branch Exchange) A system providing
         switching in an office or building.
Voice PABX - Voice only PABX for voice circuits.

      I hope you could use this information.  If anyone has any questions
or comments, or is wondering if they can get manuals to this system somehow,
please feel free to email me, I will assist you as much as my schedule will
allow.  I would like to thank erikb for telling me to write this, abstract
thought for pointing out all my spelling errors among other things, panzer
for everything he has done, and all the dc hackers.

Knowledge is the nemesis of all evil, Digital Anarchy!!!
Later, and remember to always cover your tracks in anything you do.
