Well kiddies, it's Easter time again.  Easter has got to be one of my
favorite holidays of the bunch.  No, no, no...not for any of that spiritual
rebirth or religious hooey.  Easter brings with it two of the most joyous
items in the world:  Reese's Peanut Butter Eggs and Marshmallow Peeps.

In the past two weeks I have eaten my body weight many times over
in peanut butter eggs.  I don't know what it is about those damn things, but
I just can't stop eating them.  And the Peeps?  Oh man, if you haven't put
a Marshmallow Peep in the microwave, you just haven't lived.  The cute
little yellow duckie takes on whole new dimensions as it becomes superheated
in the nuclear nightmare of a conventional microwave oven.  It becomes
like a scene from Akira as the Peep grows at an alarming rate, almost filling
up the entire oven with its grossly mutated form.  You can almost hear
it squealing with agony.  Go do it right now, and then finish reading this
issue.

The net has been more fun the past few months than a barrel full of monkeys,
(or a hottub full of co-eds, pick your own comparison).  In the time since
last issue I have been the subject of a lot of attention.  I've been
pseudo-framed for hacking a handful of sites with fake syslog messages, I've
been spoofed as the source of a pre-release CERT advisory, I've been
mentioned in numerous altered motd files on many systems, and even better,
spoofed messages from "erikb@mindvox.phantom.com" were posted to a
homosexual listserv announcing my supposed "exit from the closet."

Well, unfortunately for everyone, including the hundreds of hopeful gay
respondents to the forged post, I only like women.  But it sure is nice to
know that even men are into me.  What an ego boost.  Seriously though, one
has to wonder how the forgers knew that something called queernet.org
even existed.  I think I get around on the net, but I'd never heard of it.
Have you?  Perhaps the Posse are 'closer' than we thought.

And the abuse continues.  God knows why.  The common thread seems to be:
"Erikb is a nark."  Let's look at that logic, shall we?  If Erikb is a
nark, then he would be on some terms with law enforcement.  If he were
on some terms with law enforcement, then he would have no qualms about
handing over names of people doing bad things.  If had no qualms about
handing over names of people doing bad things, then law enforcement would
open cases based on that information.  If law enforcement opened cases based
on that information, then people would get raided.  If people would get
raided, then people would almost certainly go to jail.

Why on earth would someone want to evoke a chain of events that would
land them in jail?  Or do they not believe their own statements about
me being a nark?  Or are they convinced that they are so good that
they cannot get caught?  Or are they just pathetically stupid?

Personally I choose the latter.  These guys are not good.  And they are
very dumb.  They make more mistakes than I've seen in a long time.  And
they've pissed off very powerful people.  (No, I'm not including myself in
that list of 'Powerful People.')  It's good that much of MOD is getting out
of jail soon.  Now those guys were legitimately GOOD HACKERS.  They were
definitely assholes, but damn good computer hackers.  It will be nice to have
some harassment from dickheads with skills once again.

But I digress.

Phrack's gotten a bit of notice as of late.  In Mondo-2000, in their
"Pirate Media" article, and in Richard Kadrey's "Covert Culture"
sourcebook.  Of course both of these got the subscription information
wrong, but hell, I've learned to expect as much.  Also, the mention
of Phreak Accident's fantastic "Playing Hide & Seek -- Unix Style"
article in Dan Farmer and Weitse Venema's "Improving The Security of
Your Site by Breaking Into It" article brought in hundreds of
new subscribers.  Let's see how many of these security people register.
(How many fingers am I holding up?)

Speaking of such, Phrack has a couple of other registrations now.  One is a
teacher who wanted to use Phrack in her class.  Kudos to her!  The other was
a cool guy who just wanted to register because he felt like it.  Why
can't the rest of you be more like him?

Anyway, the money is going to sponsor a new contest.  (Considering how
well the last one went...not!)  This time, we are serious, so read in
LINE NOISE for more info.

What else?  Phrack has now made the big time in the Federal Penal system.
We're the proud recipients of the Bureau of Prisons form 328(58).  Our
material was considered to be a breach of security of the institution.
This, of course, pissed me off.  But hell, on the same form, they
denote how "Body Hair, Plant Shavings, and Sexually Explicit Personal
Photos" are also inappropriate.  Phrack or Body Hair.  You make the call.

Phrack 45...let's see...

If this issue doesn't cause neck hairs to bristle on everyone within spying
distance of the beltway, I will be very disappointed.  It's amazing what you
find in your mailbox.

We've got a lot of nifty things in this issue.  More source code for
you to play with, uuencoded goodness, cellular info, telco / pbx info,
Ho Ho Con coverage, ancient hack memorabilia, and a plethora of spurious
scatological material.  (translated:  lots of other crap)

Enjoy.

     "I am not one of those weak-spirited, sappy Americans who want
