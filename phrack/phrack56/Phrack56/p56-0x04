The Phrack Prophile iz intended to be a short biography on the indiviual in
question.  It'z Phrackz way to recognize that this person has done something
worthy of mention in some capacity.  More or less a soap-box, The Prophile
givez the person a chance to spout off about whutever they want and aggrandize
themselvez to their heart'z content.  This iz *their* time to shine.

|-Women --------------| 

Brunettes with class, wit, and intelligence.  hi suzie!@ 


|-Carz ---------------| 

As of this writing, I don't really drive.. once I settle into my new location,
I plan to purchase a new vehicle.  (I've always been into cars and performance
vehicles, so it'll be something FAST!@).  I have tons of 'favorite' cars, but
among the favorite of the favorites at the moment are the Porsche 911, Dodge
Viper, Porsche 959 (the only reason it doesn't win hands down is 'cuz it's
still not street-legal, which sucks) & Acura's NSX-T.  


|-Foodz --------------|

All kinds - I'm Indian, so naturally Indian's my favorite.. but I also love
Italian, Thai, Chinese, etc. My favorite foods overall are probably steak and
pizza.  If made right, I could live on both forever without tiring of either -
though I'd probably want Indian food occasionally (of course).

Wayyy too much to list here.  I like good beer, strong whiskey.. and pretty
much anything else as long as it's wet & alcoholic(!@).

|----------------- M E M O R A B L E   E X P E R I E N C E Z -----------------|

Buying my first modem, and installing it.  Installing QModem & calling my
first BBS.

Being introduced to the concept of hacking/phreaking by a local sysop (who
I am still the best of friends with today).  He told me I should download 
Phrack ('get phrack.. that zine rocks d00d, it has the best philes!').  So
I dl'd the latest issue at the time, which was Phrack 46.  

PBXes (System75s, SL-1s, Rolms, DataStar & all the rest..)

Setting up my first Alliance teleconference (0-700-456-1000)

CBI 

Writing my first t-file

Figuring out how to spawn DCL shells from captive and guest accounts.

first '#' prompt I ever saw.

First time on a DMS-100 

First unpublished exploit (thanks to Scott Chasin for his generous - albeit
involuntary - donation :))

Being invited to join the Phone Losers of America by el_jefe.  (Anyone other

infancy.

First root shell on a 5ESS.  

Yahoo!

Two words.. Jay Dyson.  

The first (root-yielding) hole I found in UNIX. 

The first exploit I ever stole.  

The first exploit I ever wrote.

Mastering digital wiretapping.

Being woken up by FBI agents.

Monitoring a certain computer security expert from California who appeared in
Wired Magazine along with Mark Lottor as "V.T." in an article written by John
Markoff about cellular phreaking.  (Restore your honor.. come and get me, big
guy.  And get busted for eavesdropping on phonesex!@)

When dk, prym, and I forwarded a certain Phrack editor's phone line to a
bridge, and took all his calls for a weekend.  (Sorry about that, route..
water under the bridge ;))

    [ EdNote: it wasn't for a weekend fuck0!  It was for a day (I disconnected
      the number that afternoon -- and I still remember it because it was so
      elite: 2801600). ]

IRC'ing as erikb. 

Mocking "security expert" Scott Yelich while breaking into his 'secure'
machine, security.spy.org.  (He ended up pulling his cables.. lame).

Owning everyone and everything. 

c4p3b0y vs. andy 0f m4yb3rry

autoreplyd

groktelnet

Backdooring the source code of several popular commercial & free operating

Cheating on every online game in existence for laughs (a lot of them with DK)

kibitz on beelzebub (y0y0 neal!)

Writing BoW 9 with U4EA, Lister, and DK

All the funny prank calls, especially with el_jefe, dhate, U4EA & DK.

I would like to include a lot of other things the people listed below have
said that aren't included here - most of them are often pretty witty & funny.
A lot of stupid things that people have said crossed my mind as well, but I
decided I didn't want their words showing up in my Quotes.. :)  

But, since I wrote this up from memory, and also due to space limitations,
this is not possible..

Oh well.

Asking this question is analogous to asking a question about the future of
8-tracks or dodo birds.

The underground is no longer underground.  Forums which once existed for the
discussion of hacking/phreaking, and the use of technology toward that end,
now exist for bands of semi-skilled programmers and self-proclaimed security
experts to yammer about their personal lives, which exist almost entirely on
the awful medium known as IRC.  The BBS, where the hack/phreak underground
grew from, is long since dead.  Any chump can buy access to the largest
network in the world for $19.95 a month, then show up on IRC or some other
equally lame forum, claiming to be a hacker because they read bugtraq and can
run exploits (or even worse, because they can utilize denial-of-service
attacks). The hacker mindset has become a nonexistent commodity in the new
corporate and media-friendly 'underground.'

And everyone who was a real part of the hacking/phreaking scene - at one point
or another decided they'd rather make money being legit than risk legal
troubles and wrecking their future for nothing.  Myself included.

The watered down underground's definition of a hacker is invariably something
like: "Someone who can code," or "Someone who can hack webpages," etc.

The motives and goals of this 'scene' are also entirely different, and it can
be safely concluded that it will continue to degenerate further, at a rapid
pace.  

On the flip side, going legit is a good thing... I, for one, would rather be
on the right side of the law, and getting paid for it - it was fun while it
lasted, and I learned a lot, but we all have to grow up sometime.  

And for those just getting into it now - why hack?  All the knowledge and
information you could possibly want is available at the click of a button in
any web browser (or push of an arrow, in Lynx).  

If you instinctively and successfully refuted the last two paragraphs of
bullshit logic... then you belong.
