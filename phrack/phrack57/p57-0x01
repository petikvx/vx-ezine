On this iteration of Phrack magazine there is no single editor.  The
editorial duties are being carried out by a 'Phrack Staff' collective.

At the moment we are going to remain anonymous and not publish our
nicks or our names in the magazine.  The reason we are staying anonymous
is to ensure that people know that we are working on Phrack for all the
right reasons.  And also of course because privacy is valuable.

Let's talk about privacy for a moment.

It seems to me that lately there is no motive more attractive than
becomming a celebrities.  Ironically, celebrities have a power that will
grow more compelling and yet less meaningful in the years to come.  Why?
Because becomming a celebrity will be easier to achieve.  The drive to
increase connectivity is ultimately about the access of everyone to 
everyone and everyone to everything.  A personal home page on the web -
self-created celebrity - is only the most primitive example of what lies
ahead, but is an instructive example all the same.  Home pages are self-
validation, and self-validation lies at the very center of the drive
towards the desire to become a celebrity.

Like precious metals, society has always valued what is scarce.  As privacy
becomes rarer and rarer, it will assume greater and greater worth.

Switching subjects, there is another point that I would like to make.  The
field of information security is vast.  It is vast because it concerns not
just technology, but also sociology, criminology, economics (think of risk
modeling), and many other associated subjects.  Even within the technology
side of information security, there are many different areas of study -
vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, public key infrastructure,
operating system security, and so on.  The point I am working towards is
that the world does not being and end with shellcode and it certainly
does not begin and end with exploits.  

You owe it to yourself to investigate what it is about information security
that makes it the most interesting and challenging field of study within
information technology today.

It's a big world out there.  Read books.  Experiment.  Don't just do.  Be.

Enjoy the magazine!
