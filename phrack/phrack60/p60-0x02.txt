Subject: a real newbie

Hey guys,

    [ Hello dude ]

I read your last edition and it was just great, i visited the site daily
to see if the new edition is down or not.

    [ oh, so that's you in the weblogs? Hi :> ]
    
I realy liked the files on your last edition (lockpicking was the greatest)
i won't ask questions that you expect me to ask like 'please tell me how to
hack into hotmail or the pentagon'.

    [ Oh man, you missed it, I had some 0day for you ]

put i read myself and learn things myself but as a newbie i don't find
most of your articles understandable,its only for experts and pros so
if you can write articles for newbies like me and many others who want to
learn please do, and about myself i amTURBOWEST(i am sure that u can know
my real name easily but please don't say it)

    [ Your real name is: TURBOEAST! ]

I am 12 y/o

   [ Nothing to be ashamed of. We will be at the same age in 13 years. ]

I program in python . I am trying to install linux on my PC but i face
some problems which i am trying to solve(i read a lot of books about
linux)

    [ You read these linux books? What did they teach you? How to format
      your harddrive, install a webcam and masturbate with 13 years old 
      girls on netmeetings? ]

finaly i would like to say thanks for all the phrack staff and ask them to
reply to me.

     molesters who get back to you now... ]

Subject: OK..I'm stupid, but help me anyway

OK, I admit it...I love the website, but I can't find my way around in it.
Yeah, I know, I'm dumber than a bag of rusty hammers.  But I need help.

    [ It is a good start to admit it, let's look at your case ]

I am looking for a simple program to keep track of my companies phone calls
without the company knowing I'm doing it.

    [ Oh man ... that's not good at all ... ]

No, I am NOT paranoid, they ARE out to get me.

    [ Honestly, you are not! Be prepared for the worst! Watch Jackie Chan
      and Akira movies on a daily base to train your ninja-style to be
      prepared to whatever there might come. Huh? Did you hear that?
      THEY ARE ALREADY AT YOUR DOOR. RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN! ]

I don't have $1100 to $2500 to spend on Call Accounting Software and I
don't need all those bells and whistles anyway. I just need to keep track
of who the people are talking to, what time, what extension, whether its
outbound or inbound, etc. The company has an Avaya (Lucent) Merlin Magix
PBX system. By tracking who they call I can establish that they are indeed
guilty of harrassment against my paranoid little butt.

Got any ideas? gentle....but pissed at the organization.

    [ Are you sure that noone of your coworkers watched this email? ]

From: domino@hush.com

can I please get those zines in zip format, they are interesting, but I use
windows. If not, can you complete the articles? I was reading one, and it
was in txt and it said 9 of 10. there was no link to the 10th article. this
happened many times with different ones. Yeah anyways, I would be nice to
have those as zip files for those who don't have linux as would many others,
or at least fix the links. (not much of a problem just missing a page)
Great magazine, I just wish that I could complete it. thanx.

Hello

I am having some trouble compiling the code extracted from your site. I
have the code on linux RH 7.3 Is this the problem??

[root@lenny Loki]# make linux

make[1]: *** [surplus.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/loki/loki2/Loki'
make: *** [linux] Error 2

[ I swear this dood^H^H^H^H Melissa really tried to compile that 7 years old
  source from p49. Unless we turn into a red-hat-gcc-problems-support-center
  will we not give any hints. Rumours about any fusion on the latter topic
  can not be confirmed or denied at this point. ]

[ blah blah ] ...didn't know Applied Cryptography, thanks for the link.
[ blah blah ] ...one time pad are maybe not very usefull but they are for
hackers ...[ blah blah ]. When a friend of mine rooted NASA i used one-time
pads to tell my other friends [ blah blah blah ].

[ So what's your general recommendation then? That we should banish
  blowfish and use one-time-pad's because they are..err..better when
  we want to tell our...err..friends that we ..err..hacked NASA? hu? ]

uhh... hello.

::waves::

My name's Rosie. hi.  I really actually know very little to nothing about 
hacking..  and it'd like to know more.  I know links, websites, etc. etc.  

    [ That's a beginning!
      Lesson2: "How do I read the website".
      Lesson3: "How do I understand the website"
      Lesson4: "How do I utilize the website"
      Lesson5: "How do I hire for a lawyer"
      Lesson6: "How do I escape the feds" ]

but when you can't even write html it makes things a little difficult.  God 
I feel so retarded. don't laugh. I'm a lam0r, i know.

    [ The real reason why phrack comes as .txt is because noone knows
      this < > -thingie either. ]

anyway, thanks a lot for like.. reading this...

    [ thanks a lot for like.. writing this... ]

and uh..  don't find out where i live..  cos that's.. scary..  O.o;;

adios

The users in the hackers lounge in yahoo chat are too
fast for me. i need to learn the rudiments of becoming
a hacker.Every start's somewhere...this is where i
start if you would honor me by imparting knwledge to
an eager student.

Awaiting your reply.
