What's new?

We revived Phrack Prophile to honor those who did some kewl stuff for
the scene.

This issue comes with a new section dedicated to tool annoucements
(Phrack armory). It showcases selected tools that have been released during
the last few month and that we consider cool enough to be mentioned here.
