             USEFUL COMMANDS FOR THE TP3010 DEBUG PORT

                             BY G. TENET


    ALL OF THE COMMANDS LISTED BELOW, INDICATE A LENGTH IN ALL THE READ
COMMANDS. THE LENGTH OF THE READ COMMANDS MAY VARY DUE TO
CONFIGURATION OPTIONS AND SOFTWARE VERSION.

1)  L7FE,L,A,R200

    THIS COMMAND STRING WILL LOAD '7FE' INTO THE MEMORY POINTER
REGISTER THEN LOAD THE CONTENT OF '7FE' AND '7FF' INTO THE MEMORY
POINTER REGISTER. THE 'A' THEN INCREMENTS THE CONTENTS OF THE MEMORY
POINTER REGISTER.  THE 'R200' COMMAND THEN READS 200 BYTES BEGINNING
AT THE LOCATION SPECIFIED BY THE MEMORY POINTER REGISTER.
    THIS AREA IS USED FOR STORING THE LOADED CONFIGURATION. DUE TO THE
VARIABLE NATURE OF THE CONFIGURATION RECORDS, THE READ COMMAND MAY HAVE
TO BE MODIFIED DEPENDANT ON THE NUMBER OF LINES DEFINED, THE TYPE OF LINES
DEFINED (X780,3270) AND THE TYPE OF SOFTWARE LOADED (4.2X OR 5.0X).


2)  LC4,R3,LCC,R3  (4.2X SOFTWARE)
    L124,R3,L131,R3  (5.0X SOFTWARE)

    THIS COMMAND STRING WILL DISPLAY THE BUFFER MANAGER CONTROL BLOCK AREA
WHICH HAS BUFFER COUNTS WHICH MAY SUGGEST POSSIBLE PROBLEMS.


3)  L32C,R   (4.2X SOFTWARE)
    L29C,R   (5.0X SOFTWARE)

    THIS COMMAND STRING WILL DISPLAY THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE VC'S IN THE
TP3 AT THAT MOMENT.

    IF THIS COMMAND IS USED VIA THE LOCAL CONSOLE, THE VC COUNT WILL NOT
INCLUDE THE USER CONNECTION BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO VC ON THE X.25 LINE
FOR THE LOCAL CONSOLE.

4)  L70,R60

    THIS COMMAND STRING WILL DISPLAY THE LCB (LINE CONTROL BLOCK) POINTER
FOR THE CONFIGURED LINES.

    THE ORDER THAT THE LCB POINTERS ARE ENTERED ARE: CONSOLE LCB, X.25 LCB,
LINE 1, LINE 2, LINE 3...LINE27.  ANY ZERO ENTRY IS AN UNCONFIGURED
LINE EACH LINE ENTRY IS TWO BYTES LONG.


5)  L300,L,R20    (4.2X SOFTWARE)
    L270,L,R20    (5.0X SOFTWARE)

    THIS COMMAND STRING WILL DISPLAY THE LCN VECTOR TABLE. THE ENTRIES ARE
FOR EACH ACTIVE LCN BEGINNING WITH LCN 0 THRU THE HIGHEST CONFIGURED
LCN. A 0000 ENTRY FOR AN LCN WILL INDICATE THAT THE LCN IS NOT ACTIVE.
A NON ZERO ENTRY WILL POINT TO THE DCB (DEVICE CONTROL BLOCK) OF THE
ASSOCIATED LINE/DEVICE.

6)  L1F1,L,R20     (4.2X SOFTWARE ONLY)

    THIS COMMAND STRING WILL DISPLAY THE PROTOCOL ID TABLE FOR THE
CONFIGURED/SUPPORTED PROTOCOLS. THE FORMAT OF THE OUTPUT
IS:
          999999999999...
          --  ----

          !                          09 =DEBUG
          !........................NUMBER OF ENTRIES IN THIS TABLE


7)  L(ADDRESS OF THE SERVER TABLE),R20

    THE ADDRESS OF THE SERVER TABLE IS FOUND IN #6 (ABOVE)
  THIS COMMAND WILL DISPLAY THE SERVER TABLE IN THE FORMAT:

         99999999...
         --  ----
         ! -- !................ THIS IS THE ADDRESS OF THE FIRST FREE DCB
         ! !                     IN THE FREE DCB LIST. IF 0000 THEN THERE ARE
         ! !                     NO FREE DCB'S FOR THIS SERVER AND PROTOCOL.
         ! !.....................SERVER NUMBER
         !.......................NUMBER OF ENTRIES IN THIS TABLE


    THE POINTER IN THIS TABLE , IF PRESENT, WILL POINT TO THE NEXT AVAILABLE
DCB.  WITHIN THE DCB, THERE IS A POINTER AT DISPLACEMENT 18 AND 19 WHICH
WILL POINT TO THE NEXT FREE DCB. THE LAST FREE DCB WILL HAVE A
POINTER OF 0000.

    THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS ARE USED WITHIN THE TP3 DEBUG PORT TO
PERFORM THE INDICATED ACTIONS.  ONLY THE TP3325 WILL SUPPORT THE
[# LPU NUMBER] OPTIONS.  THE USE OF THE [# LPU NUMBER] OPTION IS ONLY
REQUIRED IF YOU WISH TO ADDRESS A DIFFERENT LPU NUMBER; EXCEPT FOR THE
'S' COMMAND WITH WHICH THE LPU MUST BE DEFINED.

     A SPACE CHARACTER MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE COMMAND AND THE COMMANDS
MAY BE STACKED (EXAMPLE:  L7FE ,L,A,R5,L#2,L 7FE,L,A,R5,L#3 7FE,L,A,R 5).

    THE TP3325 COMMANDS THAT DO NOT USE THE 'LPU' PARAMETER USE THE
LAST ASSIGNED LPU NUMBER.  (EXAMPLE:  L#27FE,R2,L#17FE,R4)
THE  FIRST LOAD COMMAND ADDRESSES LPU 2 AND THE NEXT LOAD COMMAND ADDRESSES
LPU 1.  THE READ OF TWO BYTES IS READING FROM LPU 2 AND THE READ OF FOUR
BYTES IS READING FROM LPU 1.

                A VALUE
                      INCREMENTS THE MEMORY ADDRESS POINTER.

                      MEMORY.  THE LPU DEFINITION IN THE COMMAND DOES
                      NOT CHANGE THE LPU ASSIGNMENT IN THE DEBUG PORT.
                      (EXAMPLE:  GFE OR G01 OR G#301)

                I [# LPU NUMBER]

                R VALUE
                      USED TO READ MEMORY DATA. THE QUANTITY IS INDICATED
                      BY THE 'VALUE'.

                      CHECKSUM AND A CALCULATED CHECK SUM OF THE
                      OPERATING SOFTWARE.  THE LPU DEFINITION DOES
                      NOT CHANGE THE LPU ASSIGNMENT IN THE DEBUG PORT.
                      (EXAMPLE:  X OR X#2)

                Y     (TP3325 ONLY)
                      RETURNS NCC LOAD ADDRESS FROM EPROM

HARDWARE COMMANDS FOR THE TP3000

    'P' COMMAND DISPLAYS THE STATUS OF A SPECIFIED PERIPHERAL INTERFACE
DEVICE FOR THE CPU. FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF SOME OF THE MORE USEFUL ADDRESSES
WHICH CAN BE BENEFICIAL IF TRYING TO RESEARCH A PROBLEM.
THIS COMMAND IS A READ TO THE SPECIFIED DEVICE.  DEPENDANT ON THE DEVICE
BEING READ (THE ADDRESS), THE TP MAY CRASH.

    IF DSR AND TXC, THEN USE EXTERNAL CLOCKING.  IF DSR AND NO TXC,
THEN USE INTERNAL CLOCKING DERIVED FROM THE CONFIGURED LINE SPEED
PRODUCED FROM A CTC CHIP).  IF THE CLOCKING IS PRODUCED INTERNALLY,
THEN THE INTERNAL CLOCK IS ALSO PROVIDED ON PINS 11 AND 24
AT THE REAR PANEL.

    FOR THE TP3325, THE NETLINES ALWAYS USE THE EXTERNAL CLOCK SOURCE.
THE HARDWARE WAS CHANGED DURING REFINEMENT OF THE MOD ONE XPB.

    IF THE ATTACHED DEVICE IS PROVIDING CLOCKING AND THE TP3025 IS PROVIDING
CLOCKING, THE TP WILL DETECT THE CLOCKING AND WILL STOP CLOCKING. IN THE
CASE OF THE TP3025 HAVING BEEN RESET AND LOADED, IF A TP3005/3006 IS THEN
CONNECTED TO THE INTERFACE, THERE IS A RACE CONDITION WHERE THE DEVICE THAT
PROVIDES THE CLOCKING IS ARBITRARY.  THE HARDWARE LOGIC REQUIRES A RESET
TO OCCUR FOR THE TP3025 TO CHANGE PRIOR SELECTION OF 1) INTERNAL/EXTERNAL
CLOCKING AND 2) V35/RS232 INTERFACE AFTER A LOAD.

    THE DEBUG PORT "S" COMMAND WILL RETURN ONE HEX BYTE THAT REPRESENTS
THE DATA SET SIGNALS STATUS AT THE SIO CHIP FOR THE DEFINED LINE
(E.G. "S2" WILL RETURN THE DATA SET SIGNALS ON LINE 2).  THE UPPER HALF
OF THE BYTE IS USED TO REPRESENT THE DATA SET SIGNAL STATUS.

    WITH DTR TRUE ( PIN 20), RXC (PIN 11) IS CHECKED FOR AN INBOUND CLOCK
SIGNAL.  IF THERE IS A CLOCK SIGNAL, THEN THE SIO IS CLOCKED EXTERNALLY
FROM PIN 11 AND 24.  IF THERE IS NO CLOCK ON PIN 11 THEN AN INTERNAL CLOCK
SOURCE IS GATED TO THE SIO AND TO PIN 15 AND 17 ON THE REAR PANEL INTERFACE.

     THE OUTPUT OF THE DEBUG PORT 'S' COMMAND DISPLAYS ONE HEX BYTE THAT
IS A COMPOSITE OF THE DATA SET SIGNALS FROM THE PIO AND SIO CHIPS.  THE
OUTPUT BIT DEFINITIONS ARE THE SAME AS THE X.25 LINE BUT A NOTE NEEDS
TO MADE THAT THE X.25 IS A DTE INTERFACE AND THE DEVICE LINES ARE A
DCE INTERFACE.  THE UTILIZATION OF THE INBOUND RTS/CTS MAY NOT BE
REQUIRED FOR THE TP TO MAINTAIN THE INTERFACE.

    PINS 22 AND 25 ARE PAD DEPENDANT SO THEY MAY BE USED FOR
DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THAN THOSE EXPECTED.

                   ALL NUMERIC VALUES ARE IN HEX.
                   COMMAND STRINGS CAN BE USED WHILE IN THE DEBUG PORT.
