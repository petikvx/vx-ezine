        ~ Happy Anniversary Bill Cook & Tim Foley, we love you both! ~


Here it is.  Amidst all the fanfare and hoopla, Phrack 42 leaps from
your electronic mail box to infect your very soul.   It was just a few
short years ago on this day that one of the greatest abuses of
governmental authority took place in the happy little town of Austin,
Texas.  This issue marks the three year anniversary of these raids and a
hearty hello goes out to Bellcore, The United States Secret Service, and
the US District Attorney's Office.

As many of you have read previously, or otherwise heard through the
electronic grapevines, Dispater is no longer editor of Phrack.  Your
new editor, as I was most recently referred to so lovingly by
my long-time friend John Lee on the alt.cyberpunk Usenet group:
"the long hair and heavy metal beer drinking Texan that
Bruce Sterling finds so .. ahem.. 'attractive'."  In case you don't get
the joke, my name is Erikb, and I'm a hacker.

There are a few very distinct differences beginning with this issue of
Phrack.  First and foremost, Phrack is now registered with the Library
of Congress, and has its own ISSN.  Yes, boys and girls, you can
go to Washington, D.C. and look it up.  This adds a new era of
legitimacy to Phrack in that with such a registration, Phrack should
never again face any legal challenge that would bypass any paper
based magazine.

After much deliberation, I have concluded that Phrack
will no longer provide the world's anti-hacker corporate and
governmental types (IE: THE MAN) such valuable information for free.
This will of course have absolutely no effect on YOU, the hackers of the
world.  Phrack has always been, and will always continue to be yours to
copy and distribute amongst yourselves without limitation, as long as
the files retain unchanged and intact.

Entities who register their subscriptions to Phrack will be providing
valuable demographic information to Phrack and its readers on exactly
who outside our community actually takes an active interest in us.
Yes, it will also generate some income.  The proceeds of all monies
earned by Phrack will be used to actually compensate contributors for
articles of interest, and most importantly, help a certain person
pay off the debt incurred by the twist of fate dealt him through his
involvement with this publication in the past.  I have no interest in
making any money off of Phrack, as if I were to show a profit, I would
have to contribute to Tim Foley's expense account via the IRS and I have
absolutely no desire to fund his antics further than I am already
forced to.

To keep things honest, any information about the financial affairs
of Phrack will be made available to anyone who cares to write and
ask.  Thus, we can all see if "THE MAN" is truly as ethical as he would
have us believe, especially since our rate will be considerably
less than many magazines (or military screwdrivers).

Now, pertaining to "THE MAN."  Phrack does not care for you and the way
you secretly read and profit from Phrack and then use the information
contained within its files to oppress its publishers, contributors and
readers.  Henceforth, anyone involved with any ties to a computer
profession for any corporation, the military or the federal government,
any person with any ties for any telecommunications company, network
service provider or interconnect carrier, any person with any ties to
any law enforcement body, federal, state or otherwise, any elected
officials, attorneys, accountants or computer consultants of any kind
must register your subscription immediately.  If you are unsure of your
status with this regard, please contact us.  We are going to be VERY
liberal about "special dispensations" since it is not our intention to
screw anyone out of a subscription.

As many of you can imagine, this will be very hard to enforce.
This is not our main concern, as people who choose to ignore
this stipulation are in direct violation of applicable US
Copyright laws and therefore are just as unethical and guilty as
they have always claimed we are.

It would be an ironic turn of events should the FBI actually have to
conduct raids against companies like Bellcore for harboring illegal
copies of Phrack Magazine.  If, in your travels, you happen to see
such an occurrence, feel free to let us know. :)

Enjoy the magazine.  It is for and by the hacking community.  Period.

     Phrack 42 is dedicated to John Guinasso, director of global
     network security, BT North America, without whose immortal comments,
     many would have never been motivated to write.

     "If you mess with our network and we catch you -- which we always
     do -- you will go down."  (John Guinasso, Information Week, July 13, 1992)

     "Hell, WE owned Tymnet before BT did!"
