I couldn't help but notice your use of "whiley" rather than the more common
English word "wily" in the above-quoted paragraph. In the future, take the
time to grammar and spell check your replies to minimize the emotional
damage you are bound to suffer.

P.S. Thanks for the sensible code-formatting discussion. Your style sounds
a lot like that which kept me sane back when I earned my living writing
code.  The enlightened person's answer, of course, is to use an Emacs minor
mode, and to let the editor do the work while one types. Emacs is also the
answer to the Windoze 95 junkie looking for something with which to read
Phrack. Works for me.

    [ Amen.  Except for the emacs part.  pico with regexp or vim 5.0 with
      syntax highlighting is the way to go. ]

[ P52-09: On the Morality of Phreaking ]

Dear Phrack,

I am not a hacker nor a hacker wannabe, so I had only the most passing
acquaintance with your publication.  However, today by chance I came across
this article in your January 26 issue.

I am impressed. I did my MA in philosophy, and I was quite nonplussed to see
such a lucid and philosophical point of view in what is, to my understanding,
a very specialized publication not typically devoted to philosophy.  Though my
areas of interest were mainly Nietzsche and Deleuze, I found your summary of
both Mill and Kant to be accurate and well-applied.  Kudos, you obviously have
some very intelligent people on staff, whose talents are not limited to your
own area of expertise.

Yours respectfully,
Sean Saraq

    [ High praise indeed!  Thank you for the compliments.  It's good to see
      we're read in communities other then that of our target demographic. ]

0x3>--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can't believe you included article 12 in Phrack 50.  Is Phrack really
getting so sad? Have you really got nothing better to publish than
regurgitated crypto babble?

    [ Despite what you may think, we are not sad.  The phrack compound is
      imbibed with much conviviality and festivity.  Why, every Friday is
      `punch a mime day`.  We hire a mime to come down to the office and we
      all take turns punching him in the face. ]

Cheers, Chris (XORed that's Fghyud)    

    [ That's not a very good XOR implementation you have there.  It appears
      an extraneous character has been inserted.  Check your pad or the stream
      cipher.  Or perhaps check your other regurgitated crypto babble for more
      info. ]

For those readers interested in "Piercing Firewalls" (Phrack Issue 52)
take a look at datapipe.c available at www.rootshell.com. I can't think
of any way to make it work with X, like tunnel/portal, but it works fine
with telnet and nothing needs to be running outside the firewall.

While the Juggernaut program is interesting, I've found that its model for
session stealing is a tad limited.  There are two issues, one of which I've
dealt with.  First issue is the one packet read, one packet written paradigm.
It really should allow separate threads for read/write to avoid getting
easily out of synch.  This I've not dealt with, but it is understandable given
the second, the ACK storms it creates.

    [ Juggernaut 1.x is very primitive in many ways.  Juggernaut++, the next
      generation juggernaut,  has been mostly redesigned from the ground up
      with a 90% new code base.  It has many things the previous versions
      lacked, including: a much better interface, threading for concurency,
      portability, effcicieny mods, and many bugfixes. ]

The ACK storms can be avoided with an ARP attack (or possibly an ICMP
redirect).  Send an ARP message to the source of the connection you're
stealing (an ARP reply) which tells it that the ethernet address of the
machine it's talking to (the destination machine, which you want to talk to
instead) is something "off in space" like 2:3:4:5:6:7 instead of the real
address.  This needs to be done fairly often, should be started immediately
before you start your hijack attack.

    [ Indeed.  As long the host will accept and cache unsolicited ARP
      responses, this will work. ]

The result is that the machine you are intercepting becomes unable to talk to
the destination and won't desynch the session, and traffic goes to practically
nothing.  After you stop, the ARP table will shortly expire and be updated
with correct information, so the attack will either appear as a network
glitch, or you'll get alerted (NT will alert) that an IP address conflict
exists (but tell nothing about what the conflict is with).  Moreover, an ARP
reply will escape the notice of many network monitoring programs.

    [ Something like this has in fact been implemented in juggernaut++...
      And, just to answer the burning question I get asked so often, NO, J++
      is NOT publically available. ]

I have sent the code to the original author of Juggernaut (being inclined to
share knowledge) and wanted to alert you.

    [ The original author of juggernaut and I are pretty close.  I'll be shure
      to check with him. ]

take off the chain and keep the wallet, but they made him give them the
whole thing. He thought it was funny, though, especially since he had
condomes in it (It is a "christian" school). Not that he was going to

Dear Editor,

I would like to take a chance to give my most sincere thanks for
resurrecting my uttermost respect to the humanity (so often shattered by
politicians and other freaks) by providing me a unique opportunity to
immerse myself into the deep wisdom and magic of written word found in the
Line Noise section.  This is truly the place where one can look for (with a
sense of deep confidence) a genuine proof that every person is a genius on
the inside.

    [ Well thank you very much.  Although I think you are refering to
      loopback. ]

Driven by this wonderful feeling of replenished hope and respect, I'd like
to answer a cry for help from a young but talented Hacker Demonhawk, who
expressed a wish to "blow shit up!!".  I used to be a chemist, and I would

    [ Ummm... ]

like to share, in the spirit of the magazine, my knowledge and provide easy,
quick instructions for young fighting souls that would assist them in the
aforementioned noble cause.  In other words, how to build a bomb.

where would one go to get "private" hacker help?

sorry to bother ya...
i was hoping maybe you could give me some info.  don't take me for a complete
idiot,

    [ Uh oh. ]

i just don't know much about this kind of stuff.
maybe u could get me started... give a few tips???

    [ Sure.  Never kiss on the first date.  Always pack an extra pair of
      socks AND underwear.  Never put electrity in your mouth 'just to see
      what would happen'.  Also, if you happen to find yourself in the
      position, always at least *ask* to give someone the reach-around; it's
      common courtesy. ]

Dear Sir
I like you hacker people because you made life easy
to a lot of people

    [ Especially the makers of fine Bavarian shoe-horns. ]

I want to ask you an important question to me
When connecting to Internet, I found that some sites inform me with my ISP IP#

So if they're any possibility that any site can track me
and identify the following
1-what country I came from?

    [ Well; if you're dialing up to your ISP, and connecting to 'sites' from
      there, that would be a one hop jump out to the world.  And yes; they
      could find out what country you're coming from, unless you're dialed
      into a provider in another country.  In which case; it might be a little
      more difficult.  The other tipoff is when you scan in your birth
      certificate and put it up on your webpage along side your current
      address and a head shot.

      That's a 'no-no'. ]

2-what is my phone number?  

    [ Are you asking us if we know your number?  Or if someone can find your
      number when you connect to their machine and they know your IP address?
      I'm confused, so I'll answer the question both ways.

      A-1: No. We don't know your number, and we don't want it.  While we're
      at it. We don't want to make out with you either. Quit sending us the
      flowers. It's over this time once and for all.

      A-2: If you did something that would incite someone to try to find your
      phone number; odds are if it was an illegal action your ISP would gladly
      hand your information to the first law enforcement person who walked
      through the door.  Or for that matter, anyone who asks nicely.  ISPs
      aren't exactly known for being well guarded vaults of information. ]

Globally can any site by coordination with my ISP track me and catch me?

     [ Ever hear of Kevin Mitnick? ]

Please provide me with a full answer quickly.

    [ Do people not realize this is a quarterly magazine?  Quick for us is
      3 months.  If you've done something stupid and gotten busted; our
      sincerest apologies for being late. Next time we'll drop what we're
      doing and get right to it. ]

I am a Indiana University student currently studying Criminal Justice.  I am
trying to gather data and find information concerning computer hacking and
governmental and/or corporate involvement.  The twist that I am persuing
concerns a rumor that I had heard.  I was told that when some computer
hackers were caught, they were recruited by the government and/or
corporations to work in their security department. Usually where there is a
rumor, there is some truth to the matter, especially when concerning the
department of defense.  I don't know if you could help me find information
concerning this issue.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                                                Respectfully,

    [ Well...  We at Phrack haven't heard anything about the DoD hiring
      'hackers', it's been our understanding that the government at least
      prefers straight laced guys with military background to handle their
      stuff.  Although it's not out of the realms of possibility that they've
      hired 'hackers', if it's happened it's of rare occurance, and those
      individuals who fit the title of 'hacker' probably don't conform to your
      definition of what a 'hacker' really is..

     Corporations and The Government for the most part tend to shy away from
     'hackers', if merely for the stigma of being a 'hacker'.  But as a
     stereotype, hackers conjur up all sorts of bad mental images for
     respectable management types.  We're sure it's happened to some capacity,
     but we have no witty anticdotes concerning it. ]

Hello there

I have heard there are some risks using callback modems.
Can you give me some more info on this, or info where to look

    [ Risks of callback modems are fairly simple.  The problems involved with
      them are a little bit more complex.  We'll discuss both in an effort to
      best cover this subject.  The overall fundamental flaw of callback
      modems is the idea that you could 'fake' a hang-up on your end, or play
      a dialtone in an effort to fool the modem into thinking it hung up.  Then
      you wait for it to dial the number, and once it's done, 'ATA' your modem
      and pick up the carrier.

      We ourselves have tested this a couple times with moderate success, it's
      not 100% accurate, and it also depends on the hardware on the remote
      side.

      If the call-back information is based of ANI, that could provide more
      problems, since the Phrack staff has heard the rumor that you can fake
      ANI with certian types of ISDN set-ups.

      The two types of callback modem configurations, one being a program that
      acts as a frontend to the dialing mechanism, the other being hardware
      based.

      Such as, you dial in to the modem, the program asks you to authenticate
      yourself by some means, you do so; it hangs up and calls the number
      that's paired with your authenication information.  This isn't so bad,
      but if anyone remembers back when certian BBSs had callback that you
      could enter, you could make them call arbitrary phone numbers by putting
      in a fake number if their door was misconfigured.

      As far as hardware based call-back, whence you program the passwords and
      numbers into the modem and it deals with the whole transaction,
      introduces a scalability issue as well as the fact that the modem has no
      means to log on it's own, etc.. etc.. etc.

      If any readers wish to write an article based on this subject you are
      urged to write it and send it in.  It'd be nice to see some more solid
      information on this subject.

      As well; if any companies wish to send us modems, we urge you to send us
      some modems so we can put them up against a battery of hacker tested and
      hacker approved tests. ]

Hiya,

    [ Already my interest is waning... ]

    [ And I commend you on your commendation.  +100 points. ]

there and club to death those people that use single space indentation the
better.

I do however have three main points to disagree with you on.

1. Write as many comments as you can.  You may need to remember what it
was you where coding AFTER copious amounts of recriational drugs.

    [ Nah.  You don't want to get out of hand with the commenting.  You end
      up commenting needlessly and redundancy abounds.  And if you can't read
      your own code, kill yourself.  -100 points. ]

2. Put your own varaibles with uppercase first letters (to distinguish them 
from sys vars)

    [ `sys vars`?  What like argc, argv or errno?  This is a ridiculous
      suggestion.  It makes your code ugly and harder to parse.  I award you
      no points. ]

3. In reference to your comment

    "In the grand scheme of things, none are really
     any more correct than any others, except mine."

It must be said that this is completely wrong.  The only point that counts
is in fact mine.

[ P52-19@0x2: Statement of Louis J. Freeh, Director F.B.I... ]


Hello,

    I would like to say that the article, published as P52-19 is without
a doubt one of the most frightening threats to our freedom that man has
ever seen.

the article is:
"The Impact of Encryption
                                                 on Public Safety

                              Statement of Louis J. Freeh, Director
                                Federal Bureau of Investigation"

    This article basically states that Americans should have now
personal communication rights whatsoever.  The Director of the FBI
practically states that strong encryption should be banned from the
public, because he wants law enforcement officers to be able to read all
of our mail.  He says that this would be for reasons of terrorists and
criminals, but fails to state that the security of the average American
would be compromised. Due to his proposal that  you would have to
forfeit your key to government officials, and that these keys would only
be used "for the immediate decryption of criminal-related encrypted
communications or electronic information.".  Or maybe this way the
government can just intrecept all of your communications.
    My main objection to this is the irrelevancy that this would have to
the general public.  According to US law, the US Postal Service is the
ultimate form of private security.  The average American should be able
to send a letter to anywhere in the world, and it should be completely
safe.  And what more can you send with encrypted email? A program, but
you can do that with a disk in a letter.  So whats stopping these
terrorists from hopping on down to the Post Office?
    Another problem with this proposal is that encrypted information is
more used to protect your information from other parties then the
government.  I can guarantee that the average Joe living down the street
is encrypting his love letter to his mistress Jane so that his wife
doesn't see int, not so that some lazy, fat, government "official"
doesn't see it.  Most people use this technology for much more practical
usage than the deception of the government.  We use it because of the
millions of people on the Net, and perhapse we don't want those millions
to see every little thing about our personal lives.
    And finally, why should the government be able to restrict our right
to gather peacefully?  With technology moving so fast, i think that it
is reasonable to assume that the Internet is a gathering place? We have
all of the means of normal communication and more.  Chat rooms, email,
and programs like Mirabilis's ICQ allow us to communicate on a whole new
level.
    In light of all of this, i hope you share my opinions now about the
loss of freedom that this would represent.  Thank you.

    [ I have a thought.  Get a speak n' spell. ]

     I can't belive I am sending this from hotmail bought out by
microshit blah blah no this thing must be really insecure.

    [ Well, maybe it just needs love and attention and for someone to say nice
      things to it. ]

     Well I have a whole line of ideas and no one ever listens to me
netscape ect... but if your intrested e-mail me back and I'll give you
my POP adress. The benifit of this system is 1) we can piss off the FBI

    [ Yes, let's piss off the F.B.I.  And, while we're at it, let's piss off
      the IRS and let's annoy the CIA..  We can poke fun at the retarded
      wrestlers association.  And lastly, let's aggravate an enraged bull. ]

and 2) final we hackers can have a place to loyter and idile , lurk at

    [ loyter and idile?  Hey, aren't they those two Jewish film critics?  I
      love them! ]

where we can say what ever the Hell such as Full deatails on how to
enter a sys,ect...of corse we will have to screen ppl for trust ect...

    [ And screen them for stupidity. ]

But I reall belive we can werk this.
If you want to here the rest of my ground shaking ideas just ask, or
full deatials on the Crypto.net .

    [ Pass. ]

First off, I'd like to say that I love the mag...but you really get some
nutjobs that post to it..(myself included) I'm not an elite hacker, a unix
guru or anything like that(duh), but I am amazed at the effort you put into
Phrack...anyways, keep up the good work

    [ Thanks, nutjob. ]

Hi.

i'm a Swedish kid and i just wonders

    [ Now the Swedes I like.  Beautiful women.  Amazing accents.  I *think*
      they like me.  Although this one particularly hot Swedish girl I know
      doesn't seem to like me much.  I think maybe it's because I try too hard
      around her.  She'll come around and I'll be like bouncing off the walls
      trying to impress her..  I remember one time I got so excited I almost
      set sail for gaiety.  I know.  I know.  I should "just relax" and
      everything will fall into place.  I dunno tho.  She's so pretty.  And
      ahm just so awkward... ]

if you might know a good haking, freaking and craking
site. I've checked everywhere but i have not any.

    [ Huh? ]

Hey sup, I'm makin an essay site similar to Slackers Inc. but with more
essays. The only problem is I need sponsors to get my page up, can you pay me
a small fee monthly for displayin a banner for your site. I know almost

    [ O.k.  Sure, how does nothing/month sound? ]

everybody knows about Phrack Magazine but I heard you do some sponsoring, E-
mail me back if you are interested.

    [ Yah, we are *so* reknown for our advertising budget.  And now I'd like to
      make Phrack reknown for sponsoring a gay fucking highschool/college paper
      stealing webpage.  Sure.  I'll get right on that after we do our 'kick
      a baby harp seal campaign'. ]

     You need to write an Interactive tutorial to simulate hacking into a
private college or a company. You should make it realistic and hard to access.

    [ Someone already did.  They're called *.edu and *.com.  Although sometimes
      they're not too realistic. ]

Dorathea Demming,

You remark that the ICSA doesn't guarantee their certification against
attack.

"In plain English, they are saying that if you get sued, you are on your
own."

Do you know of any security company, consultant, or consortia that will
commit to helping a customer legally if they've been attacked?

In skateboarding you are a "poseur" if you don't know shit.
In the computers culture you are a "lamer" if you don't know shit.

The term that bugs me is "elite" or "eleet" or "3l33t3".
Are you elite?

I just don't like the term.
I really like the term "HI-FI" ,as in high-fidelity, or high-fidelity
stereo's.

An outdate term that orginally meant "I've got the best gear".
But now it just means "late 70's marketing scheme".

Are you hi-fi?
It has a ring to it.
You may be elite right now but in time you'll be hi-fi.
