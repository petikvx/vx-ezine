                               Introduction...
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Well, we have made it to this, the start of a new year and the start
of a new volume of Phrack Inc.  This has taken quite a while to get the long
awaited issue out, and it's been procrastinated quite a bit, so I apologize to
those that have been patiently waiting.  We have purposely waited a bit, but
we also are releasing this Phrack approximately at the same time as the Legion
of Doom/Hackers Technical Journal, which is another high quality newsletter
working with us rather than against us, and I personally recommend the
documents as highly informative.  I really enjoyed it and hope you continue to
support both of us.
        If you wish to write for Phrack Inc., merely get in touch with myself,
Knight Lightning, Cheap Shades or Beer Wolf or anyone that knows us or is on
any of the MSP boards and we shall either get back to you or get in contact
with you in some manner.  File topics can be either telecommunications or on
operating systems or some unique aspect/flaw of security.  Be looking forward
to more Phrack issues in the near and far future.  Later

         Welcome to Phrack Pro-Phile 7. Phrack Pro-Phile is created to bring
info to you, the users, about old or highly important/controversial people.
This month, I bring to you a user from the golden years of hacking and
phreaking...

                                  Dave Starr
                                  ~~~~ ~~~~~

         Dave is one of the old phreakers and hackers that accomplished so
much through voice phreaking and literal hacking rather than reading others'
findings to learn.  A master engineer, voice phreaking is one unto itself.
Dave has a PhD in B.S.

             Handle: Dave Starr
           Call him: Dave Starr
       Past handles: Micronet Phantom and Big Brother
      Handle origin: Micronet Phantom came from working with The Source
                     computer and Big Brother, of course, came from George
                     Orwell's 1984.

         Hair Color: Light Brown
          Computers: TRS-80 (4k version), Apple ][, ][+, ][e
  Sysop/Co-Sysop of: Starcom Network

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Dave started out on The Source, and stuck with them for 6 to 8 months
hacking around the system because the system was so slow security-wise, and of
course, from there, he got involved with hacking Primes.  One of the security
agents named Paul from Dialcom got in contact with Dave and discussed Dave's
hacking on The Source (his system).  After talking, they found they had common
interests, which included hacking and phreaking.  Paul gave Dave his first
code to a local dial-up for Sprint. He also led him in the direction of 8BBS,
which brought him to meet the best of the nation's phreakers and hackers at
the time, which included Susan Thunder, Roscoe DuPran, and Kevin Mitnick.
Susan and Roscoe were strong friends of Dave that he personally met as well as
Kevin, but he never met Kevin.  He met Susan in the L.A. County Courthouse
testifying against her, with Susan and Roscoe using these handles as real
names on the charges of harassment.  The phreak/hack BBS's that were most
memorable for Dave were 8BBS and his own, Starcom Network, which had hidden
commands for accessing the phreak section.  Starcom Network was a nationally
networked system that Dave created and operated.  This was a virtual copy of
The Source, for which he went to court over.  They claimed it was their
system, but he supressed them with a threat of publicity.  Modem Over
Manhattan was another memorable board on a TRS-80.  He attributes his phreak
knowledge to Paul from Dialcom and to The Source for his hacking ability as
well as Susan Thunder for information on RSTS.

         Dave Starr does intelligence and counter-intelligence work for anyone
who has money and who is not against the United States or the views of the
United States.

         Dave has always operated independently, never being a member of a
club or group, and has hand-picked his partners.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Interests: Telecomputing (phreaking and hacking), movies, a
                   fascination with the match-making systems (Dial-Your-Match
                   type systems), fun, video components.

Dave's Favorite Things
----------------------

       Women: A quiet evening with the girlfriends (NOTE: Plural).
        Cars: Mercedes 450-SL (his girlfriend's).
       Foods: Italian.
       Music: Anything excluding acid rock/heavy metal.
     Leisure: Smoking, but he hates cigarettes.

Most Memorable Experiences
--------------------------

Bringing The Source's system to their knees.
The Source hackers made demands of a rate of reduction to a minimum of a 33%
 decrease, which was sent with the comment, "I am in business so I understand
 the money, but you are becoming too fucking greedy."  Also, an article in
 Source-World magazine was demanded, bigger than the one in the last issue
 which was to contain the following: how long they'd been on the Source, why
 they were doing this, The Source's demented point of view, their correct
 point of view, how long they have been terrorizing the Source, and an apology
 for lying to all the users that the rate increase was necessary, AND an open
 apology to The Pirate and Micronet Phantom saying sorry for all the trouble
 The Source had caused them in their quest for fair and free Sourcing.  They
 wanted 2 seclev 4 accounts (normal is 3).  They assured The Source that they
 could get them here for free, and low-and-behold, they could create anything,
 but they didn't want the harassment.  If they did get harassed, they would
 immediately log in under seclev 7 and kill the system.  The threatened that
 various accounts would be killed (all with seclev 4 and up).  The Source
 person wrote, "Was this ever answered?".  They then went on to say that they
 wouldn't do any more terrorizing provided that it was responded to their
 acct. within 20 minutes.
For deleting an account, he sent back a message saying, "Fuck you".  He
 explained how they were powerless against The Pirate and Micronet Phantom,
 and how The Source shouldn't even try to catch them.  They were to continue
 to attack "The Empire" (The Source) until it was fair for the users.
Numerous other letters that played to the same tune.

Some People to Mention
----------------------

TCA Vic of The Source - Customer Service Manager/Gestapo Police
                        (Who he dearly hated and always has thought of
                         sticking a broomstick up his ass)
Paul of Dialcom (Introduced him to phreaking and put his paranoia to rest)
Susan Thunder (For teaching him RSTS and other things)
Bruce Patton (On his rag list due to a disagreement.  He received a
              electricity shut-down and a phone system shut-down of his law
              office as well as forwarding all calls to the 8BBS)
Roscoe DuPran (For having him go to court with him and meeting Susan in
               person and for many other things [unmentionable here])
The Pirate of Las Vegas (For his helpful continual harassment of The Source)
Kevin Metnick (For his infrequent but helpful service)
Larry of Modem Over Manhattan (For being there and his BBS being there)
Bernard of 8BBS (For being there and his BBS being there)

I hope you enjoyed this file, look forward to more Phrack Pro-Philes coming in
the near future.  ...And now for the regularly taken poll from all interviewees.

Of the general population of phreaks you have met, would you consider most
phreaks, if any, to be computer geeks?  Only The Pirate, a 13 year old, fit
this description.  Thank you for your time, Dave.

This file was originally intended to be a "data file" of info on TMC ports,
formulas, etc, but I decided that it would serve a better use as a "tutorial"
of sorts. But first a bit of background info...

Who is TMC?

TMC (TeleMarketing Communications) is a long distance service serving all 50
states.  While not as well known as MCI or Sprint, they are a fairly large
company.  They are capable of setting up business communications systems,
PBX's, and residential service.  Unlike most LDC's, however, they operate on a
"franchise" basis, which means that each franchise of the company has little
information about any other franchise, although they do use the same lines and
the same type of equipment.

So, what can they do for me?

Well, for most of us, TMC offers many new potentials for abuse.  One of the
primary weak points of the company is the code formats that they decided to
use.  Codes on all TMC ports are seven digits.  If they were generated
randomly, this would be a reasonably secure system from sequential code
hacking.  But TMC doesn't use random codes. Instead, they use a checksum based
formula system, with different formulas on each port.  I assume that this is
because they wanted a wide displacement of the codes over the seven-digit
series, so that a sequential code hacker wouldn't be able to get 2 or 3 good
codes in a row.  Or perhaps they are just very stupid.  In any case, it's
interesting that they seem to have never thought of what could happen if
anyone ever managed to figure out any of these formulas. Anyway, that's what
this file is about.

Great!  What else can you tell me?

Well, TMC seems to use some form of the Dimension PBX system for their billing
system (Their ads say that the switching equipment is digital).  This makes
TMC ports easily identifiable by the "Hi-Lo" bad code siren.  For those who
worry about such things, TMC is one of the "safer" companies to use. This is
largely because, unlike "unified" companies like MCI, TMC franchises don't
really care if another franchise is losing money. Since each franchise is
independent of all others, there are many 800 ports, one for each franchise.
If you use an out-of-state 800 port, you are free from such worries as ANI,
which I have never perceived as a major threat to the code-user anyway.  Also,
TMC offers lots of opportunities for the aspiring security consultant
(hehehe).

Ok, so where's some real info?

Right here.  I am going to explain as much about TMC hacking as I can manage,
without actually handing out codes.  First, an example port. The example I am
using is the 800 port for Louisville, KY.

1-800-626-9600

This is the port.  If you are not familiar with TMC, you may want to call it
to see what it sounds like.  So let's say you call it and recognize it as a
TMC.  What next?  Well, a good bet would be to run a standard "code-hack"
program on it...  Set it for seven digits, 1+ the number, and note that TMC
codes start with 0 on more than 50% of the ports I have seen. So let's say
that you then get this list of (fictional) codes...

0347589
0347889
0348179
0350358
0355408

At first glance, this may look like a series of "random" numbers.  But, look
closer.  These numbers are based on a checksum.  It is as follows...

Code Format: 03xabcy
x+y=13
(In the first code, x=4 and y=9, and, of course, 4+9=13)
a+c=15
(Here, a=7 and c=8, and 7+8=15)
b=1 to 9
(Digit "b" is unrelated to the rest of the numbers.  It could, for example, be
varied from 1-9 to possibly find more working codes)

Also note that 0+5 would equal 15, since the 0 is really a 10. Really!

Please note that the above formula is only fictional.  I wouldn't want to
possibly cause loss to TMC by giving away codes on their system!

Is that all?

No, of course not.  TMC, in their love of telecom enthusiasts, has also put an
additional prize in the Krackerjack box.  The vast majority of TMC ports have
"Outside Line" codes, which is a 2 or 3 digit number, that, when entered after
certain codes, will give an AT&T dialtone.  This is apparently a holdover from
the fact that they are using PBX equipment.  Anyway, if anyone is asking why
you'd want an AT&T dialtone, (does anyone need to ask?) it will allow
unrestricted calling.  This, of course, means 976's, 900's, Alliance
Teleconf., international calling, etc... Naturally, I can't list any of these,
but I can say that if it is 2 digits, it would start with any number from 2-9
and end in 8 or 9.  If it is three digits, it will almost always start with 6,
and be followed by any two digits. Some possible outside line codes would be
59, 69, 89, 99, 626, 636, 628, etc...  These, of course, are only examples of
possible codes. As I mentioned, these O/S line codes are entered after the
seven digit code.  The O/S line codes only work after certain 7-digit codes,
and from my experience, the 7-digit codes that they work with normally can't
be used for the usual 7 digits+1+number dialing. I can find no apparent
pattern to the codes that they do work with, so you will have to find them by
trial-and-error.

What, you want more?

Ok, well, here's a few 800 ports...

1-800-433-1440     1-800-227-0073     1-800-331-9922     1-800-451-2300
1-800-354-9379     1-800-248-4200     1-800-531-5084     1-800-351-9800

Closing.

Please note that this article is only intended as an overview of TMC and why
they would/wouldn't be a good choice for your long distance needs.  And
goodness me, don't use any of this information in an illegal way!

        PREFACE: What this guide is about.
This was written to help Hackers learn to basics of how to function on an
IBM VM/370. Not as a guide on how to get in, but on how to use it one
you have gotten in.
Comments on this are welcome at RIPCO 312-528-5020.
Note: To VM/370 Hackers, feel free to add to this file, just give myself
& Lunatic Labs credit for our parts.








































        PART 1: Logging in & out
When you connect to a VM/370 system hit RETURN till you see:

VM/370
!

To logon you type:
logon userid ('logon' may be abbreviated to 'l')
If you enter an invalid userid, It will respond with a message:
'userid not in cp directory'.
If it is valid you with get:
ENTER PASSWORD:
Enter your password, then your in, hopefully....

Logging Out:
Type:
log

        PART 2: Loading CMS & Getting set up
When you logon, if you do not see the message 'VM/SP CMS - (date) (time)
you will need to load 'CMS' (CMS in a command interpreter).
Type:
cp ipl cms
You should then see something like this:
R; T=0.01/0.01 08:05:50

Now you will be able to use both CP & CMS commands...
Some system my think you are using an IBM 3270 Terminal, if you can
emulate a 3270 (for example with Crosstalk) do so, if not type:
set terminal typewriter or set terminal dumb

        PART 3: Files
You can list your files by typing:
filelist

Wildcards can be used, so:
filelist t*
list all files beginning with a 't'.
Filenames are made up of a FILENAME and FILETYPE

You can list a file by typing:
listfile filename filetype

Other file commands are: copyfile, erase, and rename, they all work with
FILENAME FILETYPE.

        PART 4: Editing your files
I'm going to keep this down to the basics and only discuss one editor
XEDIT. To use XEDIT type:
xedit filename filetype
Once in XEDIT, enter the command 'input' to enter text, hit a RETURN on
a blank line to return to command mode, then enter the command 'FILE' to
save your file.

        PART 5: Communicating with others on the system
Sending & receiving 'NOTES':
To send a 'NOTE' to another user type:
note userid

You will then be in the XEDIT subsystem, see PART 4.
Once you are done writing your NOTE, save the file and type:
send note

This will send the NOTE to userid.
You can also use the SEND command to send other files by typing:
send filename filetype userid.

Sending messages:
You can use the TELL command to communicate with a user who is current
logged on, type:
tell userid Help me!

        PART 6: Getting Help
Type:
help

        That's it, good luck.

=Part I=
========


The Circuit Switch Digital Capability (CSDC) allows for the end to end digital
transmission of 56 kilobits per second (kb/s) data and, alternately, the
transmission of analog voice signals on a circuit switched basis.

=====================
=Network Perspective=
=====================


The CSDC feature was formerly known as PSDC (Public Switched Digital
Capability). These two terms can be used synonymously. The CSDC feature
provides an alternate voice/data capability. If a SLC Carrier System 96 is
used, digital signals are transmitted by T1 signal. If the loop is a two wire
loop, the CSDC feature utilizes time compression multi-plexing (TCM) which
allows for the transmission of digital signals over a common path using a
separate time interval for each direction. During a CSDC call an end user may
alternate between the voice and data modes as many times as desired. The CSDC
feature can support sub-variable data rates from customer premises equipment,
but a 56 kb/s rate is utilized in the network. Some possible applications of
the CSDC feature are:

     1. Audiographic Teleconferencing.
     2. Secure Voice.
     3. Facsimile.
     4. Bulk Data.
     5. Slow scan television.

The ESS switch provides end user access and performs signalling, switching,
and trunking functions between the serving ESS switch and other CSDC offices.
End users of CSDC require a network channel terminating equipment circuit
(NCTE) which is the SD-3C476 or its equivalent. End user access is over 2-wire
metallic loops terminating at the metallic facility terminal (MFT) or SLC
Carrier System. End users not served directly by a direct CSDC ESS office, can
access CSDC equipment through a RX (Remote Exchange) access arrangement via
use of a D4 Carrier System and if required, a SLC Carrier System. The
T-Carrier trunks serve for short haul transmissions while long haul
transmissions are served by digital microwave radio and other digital systems.

If the NCTE interface is used with customer premises equipment, a miniature
8-position series jack is used to connect the NCTE to other equipment. The
jack pins are paired off; data transmit pair, data receive pair, a voice pair,
and a mode switch pair. The data pairs support the simultaneous transmission
and reception of digital data in a bipolar format at 56 kb/s. The data pairs
also provide for the xmission of control information to and from the network.
The voice pairs supports analog signal transmission and provides for call
setup, disconnect and ringing functions. The mode control pair provides
signals to the network when a change in mode (voice to data/data to voice) is
requested by the customer.

A CSDC call is originated over a 2-wire loop which can also be used for
Message Telecommunication Service (MTS) calls. Lines may be marked (MTS/CSDC
or CSDC only). Touch tone is needed to originate a CSDC call. Originations may
be initiated manually or with Automatic Calling Equipment (ACE) if available.
Digit reception, transmission and signalling follow the same procedures used
for a MTS outgoing call on CCIS or non-CCIS trunks. However CSDC calls are
ALWAYS routed over digital transmission facilities.



The long term plan also allows for EA-MF (Equal Access-Multi Frequency)
signalling and improved automatic message accounting (AMA) records. A CSDC
call is screened to ensure that the originating party has CSDC service and
that the carrier to be used provides 56 kb/s voice/data capability. A blocked
call is routed to a special service error announcement. Non-CSDC calls are not
allowed to route over CSDC-only carriers. Non-payer screening is not allowed
for CSDC calls using CCIS signalling.

A CSDC call is routed directed to the carrier or indirectly via the Access
Tandem (AT) or Signal Conversion Point (SCP). The call is terminated directly
from the carrier to the end office or indirectly via the AT or SCP. Signalling
for direct routing is either CCIS or EA-MF and is assigned on a trunk group
basis.

The AT is an ESS switch which allows access to carriers from an end office
without requiring direct trunks. Signalling between end offices and the AT is
either EA-MF or CCIS. Trunks groups using EA-MF signalling can have combined
carrier traffic.  Separate trunk groups for each carrier are required for CCIS
signalling.

The SCP is an ESS switch which allows access to carriers using only CCIS
signalling from offices without the CCIS capability. Separate trunk groups for
each carrier are used between the originating end office and the SCP. Separate
trunk groups are optional between the SCP and the terminating end office and
the terminating end office. Signalling between the end office and the SCP is
MF. The SCP must have direct connection to the carrier using CCIS signalling.

=========================
=Remote Switching System=
=========================

The RSS can be used as a remote access point for CSDC. The compatibility of
RSS and CSDC improves the marketability of both features. The RSS design
allows a provision for the support of D4 special service channel bank
plug-ins. This provision allows for such applications as off premises
extensions, foreign exchanges lines, and private lines. Thus the RSS can be
used as a CSDC access point in a configuration similar to the CSDC RX
arrangement.

================
=Centrex/ESSX-1=
================

The CSDC feature is optionally available to Centrex/ESSX-1 customers. Most of
the capabilities of Centrex service can be applied to Centrex lines that have
been assigned the CSDC feature. In voice mode, the Centrex/CSDC line can
exercise any of the Centrex group features that have been assigned to the
line. In the voice/data mode, several Centrex features are inoperable or
operate only on certain calls. The CSDC feature can be provided for a Centrex
group as follows:

     1. Message Network Basis (MTS)
     2. IntraCentrex group basis
     3. InterCentrex group basis
     4. Any combination of the above

===============================
=User Perspective for the CSDC=
===============================

To establish a CSDC call, a CSDC user goes off hook, receives dial tone and
dials. The dialing format for the CSDC/MTS is as follows for interim plan:

     #99 AB (1+) 7 or 10 digits (#)

The customer dials '#99' to access the CSDC feature. The 'AB' digits are the
carrier designation code. No dial tone is returned after the 'AB' digits. The
1+ prior to the 7 or 10 digit directory number must be used if it is required
for MTS calls.  The '#' at the end is optional, if it is not dialed, end of
dialing is signalled by a time-out.

The long term dialing format for the CSDC/MTS is as follows:

     #56 (10XXX) (1+) 7 or 10 digits (#)

Dialing '#56' indicates 56kb/s alternate voice/data transmission. the '10XXX'
identifies the carrier to be used for the call. If '10XXX' is not dialed on an
inter-LATA call, the primary carrier of the subscriber is used. If '10XXX' is
not dialed on an intra-LATA call, the telco handles the call. The long term
plan also allows for several abbreviated forms. Dialing '#56 10XXX #' is
allowed for routing a call which prompts the customer to dial according to the
carrier dialing plan. Dialing '#56 10XXX' followed by a speed call is also
allowed. If a customer has pre-subscribed to a carrier which can carry CSDC
calls and the CSDC access code is stored as part of the speed calling number,
the customer dials the speed calling code to make a CSDC call.

Regular ringing is applied to the called line and audible ringing is applied
to the calling terminal. Once the voice connection is established, either
party can initiate the switch to data mode, if desired. To initiate a change
in mode a CSDC user must initiate a mode switch command via a closure of the NCT

An example of a mode switch:

     Suppose party A wants to switch to data. Party A issues a mode switch
command and receives a signal called far end voice (FEV) which is a bipolar
sequence (2031 hz at 60 ipm). Party A may now hang up the handset at any time
after initiating the mode switch command. Party B receives a far end data
(FED) tone (2031 Hz at 39 ipm) indicating party A wants to switch to data. If
party B agrees to switch to data, party B must initiate a mode switch command.
Party B may nor hang up the handset. Data transmission is now possible.
     To switch to the voice mode, anyone can initiate it. To switch, party A
would pick up the handset and initiate a mode switch command and will receive
the FED tone. Party B receives the FEV tone indicating that party A wants to
go voice. Party B must now pick up the hand set and initiate a mode switch
command. To terminate a call, either party may just leave the handset on and
indicate a mode switch. If termination is issued during a mode conflict, time
out will disconnect the call, usually about 10 or 11 seconds.

Centrex/ESSX-1 customers may utilize the CSDC service in several ways if they
have CSDC terminals with the necessary on premises equipment. The standard
CSDC call is initiated by dialing the message network access code, (9). The
dialing sequence is then identical to the plan for MTS:

     #99 AB (1+) 7 or 10 digits (interim plan)

     #56 (10XXX) (1+) 7 or 10 digits (#) (long term plan)

The dialing pattern to establish interCentrex or intraCentrex CSDC calls is as
follows:

     CSDC access code + extension

An intraCentrex/CSDC call is initiated by dialing the trunk access code
assigned to route a loop-around Centrex/CSDC trunk group. Next, the extension
of the desired station is dialed. To establish an interCentrex call a
different trunk access code must be used to route the CSDC calls to another
Centrex group instead of a station.

The CSDC maintenance circuit has a dialable digital loopback. This loopback is
very useful in CSDC testing. A customer can check their access line by dialing
the test DN. The loop is automatically activated when the call is answered.

Author Note:

I should begin by saying that there are other files out there about hacking
Primos, one written recently, that basically tell you nothing at all as far as
in-depth Primos is concerned. Those files should be deleted and this put in
its place. This is the first in many files on Primos, and I will go into many
topics, such as the on-line network, the different subsystems and other
subjects. Hope you enjoy!


*** Gaining Entry Part 1 ***

Gaining entry, as always, is the hardest part.

When you call a Primos system it will connect with something like this:


PRIMENET 19.2.7F PPOA1


If it doesn't give a welcome msg like above trying typing something like
"XXZZZUUU" and hit return and it should come back with:

Invalid command "XXZZZUUU".  (logo$cp)
Login please.
ER!

To login you type:

LOGIN <USER ID> <RETURN/ENTER>

Or Just:

LOGIN <RETURN/ENTER>
(Then it will ask for your "User ID?")


User ids differ from system to system but there are ALWAYS default accounts to
try. For "User ID?" try...

SYSTEM (This is the operators account and with it you can usually do
        anything.)
LIB
DOS

After you enter your User ID it will prompt you with:

Password?

This is of course, where you enter your password. For SYSTEM try...

SYSTEM
SYSMAN
NETLINK
PRIMENET
MANAGER
OPERATOR

And anything else you can think of. These are just common passwords to these
defaults.

For LIB try...

LIBRARY
SYSLIB
LIB
SYSTEM

For DOS try...

DOS
SYSDOS
SYSTEM

Etc...Just use your brain.


*Older Versions*

On older versions of Primos, 18 and below, you could enter one of the system
defaults above and hit CTRL-C once or twice for the password and it would drop
you into the system. Whether this is a bug or intentional I don't really have
any idea. But it does work sometimes. To see what ver of Primos your trying to
logon to just look at the welcome message when you logon:

PRIMENET 19.2.7F PPOA1

19 is the version number. So thus, if you were logging on to this particular
Prime you would NOT be able to use the above mentioned bug/default-password.

By the way, if you do not know what version it is (because it did not give you
a welcome msg when you connected...try to do the above mentioned anyway.)


Now, if it says:


Invalid user id or password; please try again.


Then you must try a different password. Notice, that the system informs you
that either the User ID, the password or both are wrong. Don't worry about
this...just hack the defaults. There have been a lot of rumors spreading
around about common defaults such as: PHANTOM, PRIMOS, PRIME & FAM, but I
believe this to be a load of shit. I have never seen a system with these
defaults on them. But, as far as PRIMOS and PRIME go, these are sometimes
common accounts but I really don't believe that they are defaults. Also try
accounts like DEMO & GUEST. These are sometimes common accounts (but never
very often).

Primos does not have limited commands before logon such as Tops 20 and DEC. So
hacking a Primos is really nothing but taking a guess.


** No passwords **

Some users have been known to use a carriage return for their password which
in other words means, once you enter your user id, your logged in without
having to enter a password. Sometimes, these are default passwords assigned by
the system operator, but that is rare. If you can get the format (perhaps you
already have any account) for the regular user id's, then try passwords like:

NETLINK
SYSTEM
PRIME
PRIMENET
PRIMOS

And other typical user passwords like sex, hot, love...etc. Most female users
that I have talked to on a local university prime all seem to have picked
account that have something to do with sex...sex being the most popular.


** The Format **

The format for a user id can be just about ANYTHING the operators or system
owners want...and they are usually random looking things that make no sense.
They can be a combination of numbers, numbers and I am almost sure CTRL
characters can be used. Lower & Upper case do not matter...the system, changes
all lower case entry to upper case. Passwords can be anything up to 16
characters in length.


** Your In! **

If you get a valid ID/Password you will see something like this:



PPOA1 (user 39) logged in Monday, 15 Dec 86 02:29:16.
Welcome to PRIMOS version 19.4.9.
Last login Friday, 12 Dec 86 08:29:04.


Congratulate yourself, you just did something that should be called something
of an achievement!

The next part will deal with very basic commands for beginners. I would like
to end this part with a few more words. Yes, Primos is hard to hack, but given
the time and patience almost every system has those basic demo accounts and
CAN be hacked. Most hackers tend to stay away from Primes, little knowing that
Primos is a system that is very entertaining and certainly kept me up late
hours of the night. Have fun and keep on hacking. If you have any questions or
comments, or I have made some sort of error, by all means get in touch with me
at whatever system you have seen me on...


** Now For The Good Shit **

This part was originally going to be a beginners introduction to commands on a
Primos system. Instead I decided to write a part which should help ANYONE with
a low level account gain system access. I would also like to thank PHRACK Inc.
on the wonderful job they are doing...without PHRACK I don't really know for
sure how I would have distributed my files. Oh yes, I know of all the other
newsletters and the like, but with PHRACK it was only a matter of getting a
hold of one of the people in charge, which is a simple matter since their
mailbox number is widely known to the hack/phreak community. I would also like
to encourage boards of this nature to support PHRACK fully, and I would also
like to congratulate you guys, once again, for the great job your doing. Now,
on with the file.



** Stuff You Should Know **

The explanation I am going to (try to) explain will NOT work all the time...
probably 60% of the time. Since I discovered this, or at least was the first
to put it in "print" I would at least ask those system operators out there to
keep my credits and the credits of my group in this file.


** Some More Stuff **

First, this is not exactly a "novice"-friendly file. You should be familiar
with the ATTACH and SLIST commands before proceeding. They are quite easy to
learn, and it is really not required to use this file, but just the same,
these are important commands in learning the Primos system so you should at
least be familiar with them. To get help on them type:

HELP SLIST

or

HELP ATTACH

You should also play with the commands until you know all of their uses.


** Okay, Here We Go **

This file is not going to explain everything I do. I'm just going to show you
how to get SYS1 privileged accounts.


First, log on to your low access account.

Type:

ATTACH MFD

Then get a DIR using:

LD

Okay, your now seeing a dir with a lot of sub-directories. The only files that
should be in the main directory (most of the time) are BOOT and SYS1. Ignore
these...look for a file called CCUTIL or something with the word UTILITY or
UTIL or UTILITIES...something that looks like UTILITY...


Okay, ATTACH to that directory with:

ATTACH <NAME OF DIRECTORY>

Now, do an LD again and look at the files. Now, here is the part that is
really random. Since not every PRIME system will have the same UTILITY
programs, just look at any that have an extension ".CPL". There might be one
called USRLST.CPL. Type:


SLIST USRLST <NO NEED TO TYPE ".CPL" AT THE END.>


Okay, it should be printing a whole bunch of bullshit. Now in this program
there SHOULD be a line that looks like the following:


A CCUTIL X


Now, CCUTIL is the name of the dir you are on so I have to point out that
CCUTIL WILL NOT ALWAYS BE THE NAME OF THAT UTILITY DIRECTORY. So if the name
of the UTILITY directory you are on is called UTILITY then the line will look
like this:


A UTILITY X


Now, the X is the PASSWORD OF THAT DIRECTORY. AGAIN, IT CAN BE ANYTHING. The
password may be UTILITY which means it will look like this:


A UTILITY UTILITY


Or the password may be SECRET. So:


A UTILITY SECRET


Pat yourself on the ass...you know have SYS1 access. Log back in with the
LOGIN command (or if it doesn't work just LOGOUT and LOGIN again). Enter
UTILITY or CCUTIL (or WHATEVER THE NAME OF THE DIRECTORY WAS) as the user id.
Then for the password just enter the password. If this doesn't work, then what
you will have to do is try out other sub-directories from the MFD directory.
Then SLIST other programs with the extension. In one of my other PRIME files I
will fully explain what I have just done and other ways to get the
directories/ids password.


Now, if you don't see any line in the program like:


S <NAME OF DIR> <PASSWORD>


Then list other programs in the utility program or try other directories. I
have gained SYS1 access like this 60% of them time. And NOT ALWAYS ON THE
UTILITY DIRECTORY.


That is about it for this file. Stay tuned for a future PHRACK issue with
another PRIME file from me. If I don't change my mind again, the next file
will deal with basic commands for beginners.

                       Automatic Number Idenfification


                 Written by Doom Prophet and Phantom Phreaker


    Automatic Number Identification (ANI) is nothing more than automatic means
for immediately identifying the Directory Number of a calling subscriber. This
process made it possible to utilize CAMA* (Centralized Automatic Message
Accounting) systems in SxS, Panel, and Xbar #1 offices.

    The identity of the calling line is determined by ANI circuits installed
in the types of CO's mentioned above. Xbar#5 offices have their own AMA
(Automatic Message Accounting) equipment and utilize an AMA translator for
automatically identifying the calling line.

    Before ANI was developed, each subscriber line (also called a local loop)
had a mechanical marking device that kept track of toll charges. These devices
were manually photographed at the end of the billing period and the amount of
the subscribers bill was determined from that. This process was time
consuming, so a new system (ANI) was developed.

      The major components of the ANI system used in SxS and Crossbar #1 are:

Directory number network and bus arrangement* for connecting the sleeve(the
lead that is added to the R(ing) and T(ip) wires of a cable pair at the MDF*
(Main Distribution Frame));

A lead of each line number through an identifier connector to the identifier
circuit;

Outpulser and Identifier connector circuit to seize an idle Identifier;

Identifier circuit to ascertain the calling party's number and send it to the
outpulser for subsequent transmission through the outpulser link to the ANI
outgoing trunk;

An ANI outgoing trunk to a Tandem office equipped with a CAMA system.

    The following is a synopsis of the ANI operations with respect to a toll
call through a #1Xbar office. The call is handled in the normal manner by the
CO equipment and is routed through an ANI outgoing trunk to a Tandem office.
The identification process starts as soon as all digits of the called number
are received by the CAMA sender in the Tandem office and when the district
junctor in the Xbar office advances to its cut-through position (a position of
the connecting circuits or paths between the line-link and trunk-link frames
in the CO).

      Upon receiving the start identification signal from the CAMA equipment,
the ANI outgoing trunk (OGT) establishes a connection through an outpulser
link to an idle outpulser circuit. An idle identifier is then seized by the
outpulser circuit through an internal Identifier connector unit. Then the
identifier through the connector unit connects to the directory number network
and bus system.

    At the same time, the identifier will signal the ANI trunk to apply a
5800Hz identification tone to the sleeve lead of the ANI trunk. The tone is
transmitted at a two-volt level over the S lead paths through the directory
number network and bus system. It will be attenuated or decreased to the
microvolt range by the time the identifier circuit is reached, necessitating
a 120dB voltage amplification by the amplifier detector equipment in the
identifier to insure proper digit identification and registration operations.

    A single ANI installation can serve as many as six CO's in a multi-office
building. The identifier starts its search for the calling line number by
testing or scanning successively the thousands secondary buses of each CO.
When the 5800Hz signal is detected, the identifier grounds corresponding leads
to the outpulser, to first register the digit of the calling office and then
the thousands digit of the calling subscriber's number. The outpulser
immediately translates the digit representing the calling office code into its
own corresponding three digit office code. The identifier continues its
scanning process successively on the groups of hundreds, tens, and units
secondary buses in the calling office, and the identified digits of the
calling number are also registered and translated in the outpulser's relay
equipment for transmission to the tandem office.
The outpulser is equipped with checking and timing features to promptly detect
and record troubles encountered (This process may be responsible for some of
the cards found while trashing). Upon completion of the scanning process, it
releases the identifier and proceeds to outpulse in MF tones the complete
calling subscriber's number to the CAMA equipment in the tandem office in the
format of KP+X+PRE+SUFF+ST where the X is an information digit. The
information digits are as follows:

0-Automatic Identification (normal)     1-Operator Identification (ONI)*
2-Identification Failure (ANIF)*

(There is also other types of outpulsing of ANI information if the calling
line has some sort of restriction on it).

    When all digits have been transmitted and the ANI trunk is cut-through for
talking, the outpulser releases.

    In the tandem office, the calling party's number is recorded on tape in
the CAMA equipment together with other data required for billing purposes.
This information, including the time of when the called station answered and
the time of disconnect, goes on AMA tapes.
The tapes themselves are usually standard reel to reel magnetic tape, and are
sent to the Revenue Accounting Office or RAO at the end of the billing period.

    So, to sum the entire ANI process up:

The toll call is made. The CO routes the call through ANI trunks where an idle
identifier is seized which then connects to the directory number network and
bus system while signalling the ANI trunk to apply the needed 5800Hz tone to
the Sleeve. The identifier begins a scanning process and determines the
calling office number and the digits of the calling subscriber's number, which
is sent by way of the outpulser in MF tones to the CAMA equipment in the
tandem office. The call information is recorded onto AMA tapes and used to
determine billing.

    Note that your number does show up on the AMA tape, if the circumstances
are correct, (any toll call, whether it is from a message-rate line or from a
flat-rate line). However, the AMA tapes do not record the calling line number
in any separated format. They are recorded on a first-come, first-serve basis.


Misc. Footnotes (denoted by an asterisk in the main article)
---------------

* ANIF-Automatic Number Identification Failure. This is when the ANI equipment
does not work properly, and could occur due to a wide variety of technical-
ities. When ANIF occurs, something called ONI (Operator Number Identification)
is used. The call is forwarded to a TSPS operator who requests the calling
line number by saying something similar to 'What number are you calling from?'

* CAMA-Centralized Automatic Message Accounting. CAMA is a system that records
call details for billing purposes. CAMA is used from a centralized location,
usually a Tandem office. CAMA is usually used to serve class 5 End Offices in
a rural area near a large city which contains a Tandem or Toll Office. CAMA is
similar to LAMA, except LAMA is localized in a specific CO and CAMA is not.

* The Directory Number Network and bus system is a network involved with the
ANI process. It is a grid of vertical and horizontal buses, grouped and class-
ified as Primary or Secondary. There are 100 vertical and 100 horizontal buses
in the Primary system. In the Secondary system, there are two sub-groups:Bus
system #1 and Bus system #2, both of which have ten horizontal and vertical
buses. These buses as a whole are linked to the Identifier in the ANI trunk
and are responsible for identifying tens, hundreds, thousands and units digits
of the calling number (After the Identifier begins its scanning process).

* MDF-Main Distribution Frame. This is the area where all cable pairs of a
certain office meet, and a third wire, the Sleeve wire, is added. The Sleeve
wire is what is used in gathering ANI information, as well as determining a
called lines status (off/on hook) in certain switching systems by presence of
voltage. (voltage present on Sleeve, line is busy, no voltage, line is idle.)

* ONI-Operator Number Identification. See ANIF footnote.

NOTE: There are also other forms of Automatic Message Accounting, such as LAMA
(Local Automatic Message Accounting). LAMA is used in the class 5 End Office
as opposed to CAMA in a Toll Office. If your End Office had LAMA, then the ANI
information would be recorded at the local level and sent from there. The LAMA
arrangement may be computerized, in which it would denoted with a C included
(LAMA-C or C-LAMA).

In PWN Issue Seven/Part One, we had an article entitled "Maxfield Strikes
Again."  It was about a system known as "THE BOARD" in the Detroit 313 NPA.
The number was 313-592-4143 and the newuser password was "HEL-N555,ELITE,3"
(then return).  It was kind of unique because it was run off of an HP2000
computer.  On August 20, 1986 the following message was seen on "THE BOARD."

Title:   YOU'VE BEEN HAD!!!
To:      ALL
From:    HIGH TECH
Posted:   8/20/86 @ 12.08 hours

Greetings:

You are now on THE BOARD, a "sting" BBS operated by MIKE WENDLAND of the
WDIV-TV I-Team.  The purpose?  To demonstrate and document the extent of
criminal and potentially illegal hacking and telephone fraud activity by the
so-called "hacking community."

Thanks for your cooperation.  In the past month and a half, we've received all
sorts of information from you implicating many of you to credit card fraud,
telephone billing fraud, vandalism, and possible break-ins to government or
public safety computers.  And the beauty of this is we have your posts, your
E-Mail and--- most importantly ---your REAL names and addresses.

What are we going to do with it?  Stay tuned to News 4.  I plan a special
series of reports about our experiences with THE BOARD, which saw users check
in from coast-to-coast and Canada, users ranging in age from 12 to 48.  For our
regular users, I have been known as High Tech, among other ID's.  John Maxfield
of Boardscan served as our consultant and provided the HP2000 that this "sting"
ran on.  Through call forwarding and other conveniences made possible by
telephone technology, the BBS operated remotely here in the Detroit area.

When will our reports be ready?  In a few weeks.  We now will be contacting
many of you directly, talking with law enforcement and security agents from
credit card companies and the telephone services.

It should be a hell of a series.  Thanks for your help.  And don't bother
trying any harassment.  Remember, we've got YOUR real names.

                    Mike Wendland & the I-Team Investigate
                            "Electronic Gangsters"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Carman Harlan:  Well we've all heard of computer hackers, those electronic
                gangsters who try to break into other people's computer
                systems.  Tonight on the first of a three part news 4 [WDIV-TV,
                Channel 4 in Detroit] extra, Mike Wendland and the I-Team will
                investigate how such computer antics jeopardize our privacy.
                Mike joins us now to tell us what at first may have been
                innocent fun may now be affecting our pocket books.

Mike Wendland:  Well Carman and Mort, thanks to the media and movies just about
                everyone knows about hackers and phone phreaks.  By hooking
                their Apples, their Ataris, and their Commodores into telephone
                lines these electronic enthusiasts have developed a new form of
                communication, the computer bulletin board.  There are probably
                10,000 of these message swapping boards around the country
                today, most are innocent and worthwhile.  There are an
                estimated 1,000 pirate or hacker boards where the main
                activities are electronic trespassing, and crime [Estimates
                provided by John Maxfield].

[Clipping From Wargames comes on]

                In movies like Wargames computer hackers are portrayed as
                innocent hobbyist explorers acting more out of mischief than
                malice.  But today a new generation of hackers have emerged.  A
                hacker that uses his knowledge of computers to commit crimes.
                Hackers have electronically broken into banks, ripped off
                telephone companies for millions of dollars, trafficked in
                stolen credit card numbers, and through there network of
                computer bulletin boards traded information on everything from
                making bombs to causing terrorism.

[Picture of John Maxfield comes on]

John Maxfield:  Well, now there are electronic gangsters, not just electronic
                explorers they are actually gangsters.  These hackers meet
                electronically through the phone lines or computer bulletin
                boards.  They don't meet face to face usually, but it is a
                semi-organized gang stile activity, much like a street gang, or
                motorcycle gang.

Mike Wendland:  John Maxfield of Detroit is America's foremost "Hacker
                Tracker".  He has worked for the F.B.I. and various other law
                enforcement and security organizations.  Helping catch dozens
                of hackers around the country, who have used their computers
                for illegal purposes.  To find out how widespread these
                electronic gangsters have become, we used John Maxfield as a
                consultant to setup a so-called "sting" bulletin board [THE
                BOARD].

                We wrote and designed a special program that would allow us to
                monitor the calls we received and to carefully monitor the
                information that was being posted.  We called our undercover
                operation "The Board", and put the word out on the underground
                hacker network that a new bulletin board was in operation for
                the "Elite Hacker".  Then we sat back and watched the computer
                calls roll in.

                In all we ran our so called "Sting" board for about a month and
                a half, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  We received literally
                hundreds of phone calls from hackers coast to coast, ranging in
                age from 17 to 43.  All of them though had one thing in common,
                they were looking for ways to cheat the system.

                The hackers identified themselves by nicknames or handles like
                CB radio operators use, calling themselves things like Ax
                Murderer, Big Foot, and Captain Magic.  They left messages on a
                variety of questionable subjects, this hacker for instance told
                how to confidentially eavesdrop on drug enforcement radio
                conversations.  A New York hacker called The Jolter swapped
                information on making free long-distance calls through stolen
                access codes, and plenty of others offered credit card numbers
                to make illegal purchases on someone else's account.

John Maxfield:  Well these kids trade these credit card numbers through the
                computer bulletin boards much like they'd trade baseball cards
                at school.  What we've seen in the last few years is a series
                of hacker gangs that are run by an adult, sort of the
                mastermind who stays in the background and is the one who
                fences the merchandise that the kids order with the stolen
                credit cards.

Mike Wendland:  Then there were the malicious messages that had the potential
                to do great harm.  The Repo Man from West Virginia left this
                message telling hackers precisely how to break into a hospital
                computer in the Charleston, WV area.

[Picture of Hospital]

                This is where that number rings, the Charleston Area Medical
                Center.  We immediately notified the hospital that there
                computer security had been breached.  Through a spokesperson,
                the hospital said that a hacker had indeed broken into the
                hospital's computer and had altered billing records.  They
                immediately tightened security and began an investigation.
                They caught the hacker who has agreed to make restitution for
                the damages.  Maxfield says though, "Most such break-ins are
                never solved".

John Maxfield:  When you are talking about electronic computer intrusion, it's
                the perfect crime.  It's all done anonymously, it's all done by
                wires, there's no foot prints, no finger prints, no blood
                stains, no smoking guns, nothing.  You may not even know the
                system has been penetrated.

Mike Wendland:  Our experience with the "Sting" bulletin board came to a sudden
                and unexpected end.  Our cover was blown when the hackers
                somehow obtained confidential telephone company records.  The
                result a campaign of harassment and threats that raised serious
                questions about just how private our supposedly personal
                records really are.  That part of the story tomorrow.  [For a
                little more detail about how their cover was "blown" see PWN
                Issue 7/Part One, "Maxfield Strikes Again."  Heh heh heh heh.]

Mort Crim:  So these aren't just kids on a lark anymore, but who are the
            hackers?

Mike Wendland:  I'd say most of them are teenagers, our investigation has
                linked about 50 of them hardcore around this area, but most
                very young.

Mort Crim:  Far beyond just vandalism!

Mike Wendland:  Yep.

Carman Harlan:  Tonight on the second part of a news 4 [WDIV-TV, Channel 4 in
                Detroit] extra Mike Wendland and the I-Team report on how they
                setup a sting bulletin board to see how much they could get on
                these criminal hackers.  Mike joins us now to explain that
                information, that was not the only thing they got.

Mike Wendland:  That's right, Carman & Mort.  Our so called sting bulletin
                board received hundreds of calls from hackers all over America,
                and even Canada.  They offered to trade stolen credit cards,
                and they told how to electronically break into sensitive
                government computers.  But our investigation came to a sudden
                end when our sting board was stung.  Our cover was blown when
                a hacker discovered that this man, computer security expert
                John Maxfield was serving as the I-Team consultant on the
                investigation.  Maxfield specializes as a hacker tracker and
                has worked for the F.B.I. and various other police and security
                agencies.  The hacker discovered our sting board by getting a
                hold of Maxfield's supposedly confidential telephone records.

John Maxfield:  And in the process of doing that he discovered the real number
                to the computer.  We were using a different phone number that
                was call forwarded to the true phone number, he found that
                number out and called it to discover he was on the sting board.

Mike Wendland:  But the hacker didn't stop at exposing the sting, instead he
                posted copies of Maxfield's private telephone bill on other
                hacker bulletin boards across the country.

John Maxfield:  The harassment started, all of the people on my phone bill got
                calls from hackers.  In some cases their phone records were
                also stolen, friends and relatives of theirs got calls from
                hackers.  There was all sorts of other harassment, I got a call
                from a food service in Los Angeles asking where I wanted the
                500 pounds of pumpkins delivered.  Some of these kids are
                running around with guns, several of them made threats that
                they were going to come to Detroit, shoot me and shoot Mike
                Wendland.

Mike Wendland:  A spokesperson from Michigan Bell said that the breakdown in
                security that led to the release of Maxfield's confidential
                records was unprecedented.

Phil Jones (MI Bell):  I think as a company were very concerned because we work
                       very hard to protect the confidentially of customer's
                       records.  [Yeah, right].

Mike Wendland:  The hacker who got a hold of Maxfield's confidential phone
                records is far removed from Michigan, he lives in Brooklyn, NY
                and goes by the name Little David [Bill From RNOC].  He says
                that getting confidential records from Michigan Bell or any
                other phone company is child's play. Little David is 17 years
                old.  He refused to appear on camera, but did admit that he
                conned the phone company out of releasing the records by simply
                posing as Maxfield.  He said that he has also sold pirated
                long-distance access codes, and confidential information
                obtained by hacking into the consumer credit files of T.R.W.
                Little David says that one of his customers is a skip-tracer, a
                private investigator from California who specializes in finding
                missing people.  Maxfield, meanwhile, says that his own
                information verified Little David's claim.

John Maxfield:  The nearest I can determine the skip-tracer was using the
                hacker, the 17 year old boy to find out the whereabouts of
                people he was paid to find.  He did this by getting into the
                credit bureau records for the private eye.  This is an invasion
                of privacy, but it's my understanding that this boy was getting
                paid for his services.

Mike Wendland:  In Long Island in New York, Maxfield's telephone records were
                also posted on a bulletin board sponsored by Eric Corley,
                publisher of a hacker newsletter [2600 Magazine].  Corley
                doesn't dispute the harassment that Maxfield received.

Eric Corley:  Any group can harass any other group, the difference with hackers
              is that they know how to use particular technology to do it.  If
              you get a malevolent hacker mad at you there's no telling all the
              different things that can happen.

Mike Wendland:  What can happen?  Well besides getting your credit card number
                or charging things to your account, hackers have been known to
                change people's credit ratings. It is really serious business!
                And tomorrow night we'll hear about the hacker philosophy which
                holds that if there is information out there about you it is
                fair game.

Mort Crim:  "1984" in 1986.

Mike Wendland:  It is!

Carman Harlan:  News four [WDIV-TV, Channel 4 in Detroit] extra, Mike Wendland
                and the I-Team look at how these hackers are getting out of
                hand.

Mike Wendland:  The problem with hackers is not just with mischief anymore,
                unscrupulous hackers are not only invading your privacy, they
                are costing you money.  Case and point, your telephone bills,
                because American telephone companies have long been targets of
                computer hackers and thieves we are paying more than we should.
                Experts say the long distance companies lose tens of millions
                of dollars a year to, these self described "Phone Phreaks."

                For example in Lansing, the Michigan Association of
                Governmental Employees received a phone bill totalling nearly
                three hundred and twenty one thousand dollars.  For calls
                illegally racked up on there credit card by hackers.  Such
                victims seldom get stuck paying the charges, so hackers claim
                there piracy is innocent fun.

Phil Jones (MI Bell):  Nothing could be further from the truth, it becomes a
                       very costly kind of fun.  What happens is that the
                       majority of the customers who do pay there bills on
                       time, and do use our service lawfully end up quitting
                       after that bill.

Mike Wendland:  That's not all, hackers regularly invade our privacy, they
                leave pirated credit card numbers and information how to break
                into electronic computer banks on bulletin boards.  Thousands
                of such electronic message centers exist across the country,
                most operated by teenagers.

John Maxfield:  There is no law enforcement, no parental guidance, they're just
                on their own so they can do anything they want.  So the few bad
                ones that know how to steal and commit computer crimes teach
                the other ones.

Mike Wendland:  There is very little that is safe from hackers, from automatic
                teller machines and banks to the internal telephone systems at
                the White House.  Hackers have found ways around them all
                hackers even have their own underground publication of sorts
                that tells them how to do it.

[Close up of publication]

                Its called 2600 [2600 Magazine], after the 2600 hertz that
                phone phreaks use to bypass telephone companies billing
                equipment.  It tells you how to find credit card numbers and
                confidential records in trash bins, break into private
                mainframe computers, access airline's computers, and find
                financial information on other people through the nations
                largest credit bureau, TRW.  2600 is published in a
                ram-shackled old house at the far end of Long Island, New York
                by this man, Eric Corley.  He argues that hackers aren't
                electronic gangsters.

Eric Corley:   We like to call them freedom fighters.  Hackers are the true
               individuals of the computer revolution, they go were people tell
               them not to go, they find out things they weren't supposed to
               find out.

Mike Wendland:  Corley's newsletter supports a hacker bulletin board called the
                Private Sector.  Last year the F.B.I. raided it.

Eric Corley:  They managed to charge the system operator with illegal
              possession of a burglary tool in the form of a computer program.

Mike Wendland:  But the bulletin board is still in operation.  Corley resents
                the suspicion that hackers are involved in criminal activities.

Eric Corley:  Hackers are not the people who go around looking for credit cards
              and stealing merchandise.  That's common thievery. Hackers are
              the people who explore.  So basically what we are saying is more
              knowledge for more people.  That will make it better for
              everybody.

Mike Wendland:  He claims that hackers, in their own ways, really protect our
                rights by exposing our vulnerabilities.  Well hackers may
                expose our vulnerabilities, but they also invade our privacy.
                There activities have really spotlighted the whole question of
                privacy raised by the massive files that are now out there in
                electronic data banks.  Much of that information that we think
                is personal and confidential is often available to the whole
                world.

Computer Hackers Beware! - Senate Passes Computer Fraud And Abuse Act
------------------------   ------------------------------------------
On October 2, 1986, the US Senate unanimously passed the Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act of 1986.  The bill, S. 2281, imposes fines of up to $500,000 and/or
prison terms of up to 20 years for breaking into government or financial
institutions' computers.

The Federal Government alone operates more than 18,000 medium-scale and
large-scale computers at some 4,500 different sites.  The Office of Technology
Assessment estimates the government's investment in computers over the past
four years at roughly $60 million.  The General Services Administration
estimates that there will be 250,000 to 500,000 computers in use by the Federal
Government by 1990.

In 1984, legislators' attention to and concern about computer fraud was
heightened by a report by the American Bar Association task force on computer
crime.  According to the report, based on a survey of 1,000 private
organizations and public agencies, forty-five percent of the 283 respondents
had been victimized by some form of computer crime, and more than 25 percent
had sustained financial losses totaling between an estimated $145 million and
$730 million during one twelve month period.

To address this problem, the Senate and House enacted, in 1984, the first
computer statute (18 U.S.C. 1030).  Early this year both the House and Senate
introduced legislation to expand and amend this statute.

In the current bill, which is expected to be signed by President Reagan next
week, penalties will be imposed on anyone who knowingly or intentionally
accesses a computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access and:

(1) Obtains from government computers information relating to national defense
    and foreign relations.

(2) Obtains information contained in financial records of financial
    institutions.

(3) Affects the use of the government's operation of a computer in any
    department or agency of the government that is exclusively for the use of
    the U.S. Government.

(4) Obtains anything of value, unless the object of the fraud and the thing
    obtained consists only of the use of the computer.

(5) Alters, damages, or destroys information in any federal interest computer,
    or prevents authorized use of any such computer or information.

Under the bill, a person would be guilty of computer fraud if he or she causes
a loss of $1,000 or more during any one year period.

Depending on the offense, penalties include fines up to $100,000 for a
misdemeanor, $250,000 for a felony, $500,000 if the crime is committed by an
organization, and prison terms of up to 20 years.

The bill also prohibits traffic in passwords and other information from
computers used for interstate or foreign commerce.  This part of the bill makes
it possible for Federal Prosecutors to crack down on pirate bulletin boards and
similar operations because the bill covers business computers, online networks,
and online news and information services, all of which are considered
interstate commerce.

    "GTE Develops High-Speed GaAs Multiplexer Combining Four Data Channels"

In an effort to achieve data communication rates of several gigabits per
second, GTE Labs (Waltham, MA) is combining the high-capacity of fiber optics
with the high speed of gallium arsenide circuits.  The research arm of GTE has
designed a GaAs multiplexer that can combine four data channels, each with a
communication rate of 1 gigabit per second, into one channel.  GTE has also
recently developed a technique called MOVPE (metal-organic vapor-phase
epitaxy) for efficiently growing thin-film GaAs crystals.

The new devices should play an important role in future communication systems,
which will involve high-capacity fiber-optic cables connecting houses and
offices through telephone switching centres.  Data rates on these cables could
be as high as 20 gigabits per second.  In addition to standard computer data,
numerous video channels could be supported, each with a data rate of almost
100 megabits per second.  The GaAs multiplexers will probably be the only
devices fast enough to interface houses and offices through this fiber-optic
grid.  In future supercomputers [misuse of the word -eds.] these multiplexers
will also be used for high-speed fiber-optic transmissions between various
boards in the computer, replacing copper wires.  Because of the high-speed
nature of the fiber-optic link, such techniques may even be used for chip-to-
chip communication.

GTE said it has completed a prototype of the GaAs multiplexer and a final
version should be ready in less than a year.

Comments:  And meanwhile, while GTE's been building gigabit/second
           multiplexers, AT&T Bell Labs is still experimenting with the neuron
           webs from slug brains...

Texas Rumors Run Rampant                                      December 24, 1986
------------------------
Remember all that controversy about Sir Gamelord being Videosmith?

Well here's the story...

It all started on a conference bridge, where a number of people including Evil
Jay, Line Breaker [who, indirectly started all of this], and Blade Runner among
others were having a discussion.

Line Breaker was telling a story of how Videosmith was a fed, how Videosmith
had busted everyone at a phreak con (or something like that), and how he [Line
Breaker] and some other people called Videosmith up, pretending to be feds, and
got him to admit that he did these things.

Blade Runner was terribly pissed at Sir Gamelord (who had recently attempted to
take over P.H.I.R.M., which is Blade Runner's group).  As a retaliatory strike
and after hearing this slander upon Videosmith's name, Blade Runner started
telling people that Sir Gamelord was Videosmith.  The stories have been getting
more and more exaggerated since then but that is all that really happened.

[They say everything is bigger in Texas...I guess that includes bullshit too!]

The Cracker Disappears                                        December 27, 1986
----------------------
The rumors and stories are flying around about the disappearance of one
Bill Landreth aka The Cracker.

Bill Landreth is the author of "Out Of The Inner Circle," a book on hackers
that was published a few years back.

According to newspaper articles in the San Francisco area, Bill was at a
friend's home working on some computer program.  His friend stepped out for a
while and when he returned, there was a lot of garbage on screen and a suicide
message.

On Ripco BBS, message was posted about Bill Landreth, stating that he had
disappeared, and was once again wanted by the FBI.  The message asked that
anyone in contact with Bill would tell him to contact his "friends."

Most of what is going on right now is bogus rumors.  There may be a follow up
story in the next PWN.

U.S. Sprint Screws Up                                         December 24, 1986
---------------------
Taken From the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinal

                          "He got a 1,400 page bill!"

In Montrose, Colorado, Brad Switzer said he thought the box from the U.S.
Sprint  Long Distance Company was an early Christmas present until he opened it
and found that it contained a 1,400 page phone bill.

The $34,000 bill was delivered to Switzer's doorstep Monday.  He called U.S.
Sprint's Denver office, where company officials assured him he was "Off the
Hook."  A spokesman for U.S. Sprint said that Switzer had mistakenly received
U.S. Sprint's own phone bill for long distance calls.
