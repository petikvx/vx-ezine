                                       Entering launch code: DLG-2209-TVX
Launch code confirmed.
                                       Holy shit!
All right lets do it. Enable missiles. Target selection............. complete.
                                       Time on target selection..... complete.
                                       Yield selection.............. complete.
I need to get someone at the phone.    Number one enabled, two, three, four,
SAC. Try SAW HQ on the HF.             five, ..ten. All missiles enabled.
                                       That's not the correct procedure.
Screw the procedure. I want somebody
on the goddamn phone before I kill

  This phrack issue, as well as the last two, comes without a prophile.
This situation will not change unless we find someone who is worth a
prophile.

  The latest and all previous phrack issues are available online at
http://www.phrack.org. Readers without web access can subscribe to the
phrack-distrib mailinglist. Every new phrack is sent as email attachment
to this list - shouts to the monkeys at nasa.gov who complained about
their network situation (email only) but did not want to miss the latest
phrack. A new phrack issue (without the attachment) is announced on
the announcement mailinglist.

To subscribe to the announcement mailinglist:
$ mail announcement-subscribe@lists.phrack.org < /dev/null

To subscribe to the distribution mailinglist:
$ mail distrib-subscribe@lists.phrack.org < /dev/null

To retrieve older issues (must subscribe first):
$ mail distrib-index@lists.phrack.org < /dev/null
$ mail distrib-get.<n>@lists.phrack.org < /dev/null
where n indicated the phrack issue [1..58].

Enjoy the magazine!
