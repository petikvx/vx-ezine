Introduction
------------
    Welcome to Phrack Inc. VI!  We have been somewhat delayed in our release
due to problems with my home life (see PWN in this issue for details) but here
we go!  Right now, Metal Shop Private is down, but when I return to real life,
it should re-emerge with a new BBS program and hopefully will be better than
ever.  Now, with the release of Telecomputist Newsletter, we have the
capabilities to have Phrack Inc. printed out.
    If you feel you'd like to subscribe to something like this, it would be
operated in this manner: being one of our positive points, it will be free to
an extent.  You, the subscriber, will be paying for postage and if necessary,
envelopes as well as P.O. Box rental, but none of this should amount to much.
If you are interested in getting this, please contact any member of the Metal
Shop Family or Phantom Phreaker of The Alliance with your opinions on this.  If
we get enough support, we'll get this rolling.  Later on.

                               On June 10, 1986

\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\
Welcome to issue 3 of Phrack Pro-Phile.  The information herein was originally
supposed to appear as a special issue of PWN, but instead was made this issue's
Phrack Pro-Phile.  Taran King and I have collected much information about the
different clubs and groups of today and yesterday and compiled in the form that
you will now see.
\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\`\
Extasyy Elite:  The story of Extasyy Elite is a sad one for the group was
                literally destroyed by its own members.  The Poltergeist turned
                in all of Extasyy after he got busted for carding.  This led
                the authorities to The Mentor who had stolen 30 Apple //es.
                Mentor's bust almost led to The Protestor, but luckily, The
                Mentor was able to warn Protestor in time.  (See Phrack World
                News Issue III).

The membership of the club included:

                  Bit Blitz                    Cisban Evil Priest
                  Crustaceo Mutoid             Kleptic Wizard
                  The Mentor                   The Poltergeist
                  The Protestor


Crustaceo Mutoid later joined the Racketeers, but now he and The Mentor write
for a California newsletter called the Underground Informer.

         Extasyy hung out on Hack Net BBS and FWSO, a bbs in Colorado.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fargo 4A:  This group was started on a conference consisting of Bioc Agent 003,
           TUC, Big Brother, Quasi-Moto, Video Warhead, and the Wizard of
           Arpanet.  What they did was get several Directory Assistants on the
           conference, and each person assumed a role of some sort of telco
           agent.  Now they told the DA's that all their calls were going to be
           re-routed to a different location.  They got some of the DA's to
           believe them, and some of them were almost laid off because of this
           conference.  By the way, Fargo is in North Dakota, that's where the
           first DA was from.

           It is believed that Wizard of ARPAnet was busted by John Maxfield
           and that BIOC completely retired from the phreak world.  This group
           was unofficially disbanded, but several of the members are still
           active.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Five-O:  A reasonably new IBM kracking group, which was formally the Imperial
         Warlords.  Currently they are re-kracking software and claiming it to
         be original by themselves.  They are known for placing insulting
         messages towards certain people inside their re-kracked software.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IBM Syndicate:  This group was formed around April 6, 1986.  Its charter
                members included; Dark Creaper (916), Brew Associates (215),
                Major Havoc (301), and one other whose handle remains unknown
                to me at the current time.  They were a new phreak/hack/pirate
                group.  Unfortunately, this group (like so many others) died
                within its first month.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Icub (International Computer Underground Bandits):

     This is a hack/phreak group who's main emphasis is on phreaking.  It is
     based in Memphis, Tennessee.  It has 10 members in it, and the only
     semi-active member left is Doc Holiday.  Not much else is really known
     about this group except that it is inactive and there have not been any
     announced plans to revive it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOD/H:  Legion Of Doom/Hackers

        These two groups are very closely intertwined.  They both were formed
        on Plovernet. The founding member was Lex Luthor.  Through the years,
        there have been LOD/H bulletin boards such as Blottoland, LOD, FOD,
        etc.  Today there is Catch 22 and a new LOD bbs, supposedly being run
        by King Blotto.  The current member list of the group is as follows:

             Legion Of Hackers                      Legion Of Doom
             -----------------                      --------------
             Blue Archer                            Phucked Agent 04
             Gary Seven                             Compu-Phreak
             Kerrang Khan
             Lex Luthor
             Master Of Impact
             Silver Spy (Sysop of Catch 22)
             The Marauder
             The Videosmith

LOD/H is known for being one of the oldest and most knowledgeable of all
groups.  In the past they have written many extensive g-philes about various
topics.  (Please forgive any mistakes in the member list since this list was
provided by Lex Luthor approximately 1 1/2 - 2 months ago).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metal Communications: A very large group that has written many files throughout
                      its existence.  Some of the boards in its menagerie
                      include Speed Demon Elite, Metal AE, Metal Works AE,
                      Metalland I and several others. The membership of Metal
                      Communications includes:

Cobalt 60/Crimson Pirate/Dr. Local/Red Pirate/Shadow Lord/The Angel Of Destiny
 The Apothecary/The Byte/The Byte Byter/The Dark Wizard/The Duke/The Dutchman
The Man In Black/The Prophet/The Pink Panther/The Voice Over/The Radical Rocker
                         The Warlock Lord/White Knight

Red Pirate, Crimson Pirate, and Dr. Local are the group's main ware
distributors.

A subsidiary of Metal Communications is the Neon Knights whose membership
includes:

    Baby Demon/Jolly*Roger/The Blade aka Killer Kurt/The Master of Reality
                     The Metallian/The Outland/Zandar Zan
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAG/PAP: Phreaks Against Geeks/Phreaks Against Phreaks Against Geeks

         PAG:  This group was formed by TWCB Inc. as a joke on a conference in
               December, 1985.  The charter members were TWCB, Inc.  taRfruS,
               Blue Adept, The Clashmaster and a few others.  Later, Catcher in
               the Rye and the Slovak wanted to join.

         PAP:  In resistance to PAG, Boston Stangler and Micro Man formed PAP.
               Several others sided with them but were never formal members.

All of this nonsense was really started on the Dartmouth system and was mainly
a feud between phreaks in the Boston (617) area until TWCB got involved.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Administration:  This group was sort of in two parts; The Administration
                     and Team Hackers '86.  The membership of these groups
                     include:

                  Adolph Hitler...............Team Hackers '86
                  Alpha Centauri
                  Author Unknown..............Team Hackers '86
                  British Bloke...............Team Hackers '86
                  Dark Priest
                  David Lightman (214)........Administration Leader/
                                              Team Hackers '86
                  Dr. Pepper
                  Hewlett Hackard
                  Major Havock................Team Hackers '86

                  Renegade Rebel
                  Sasha Kinski................Team Hackers '86
                  The President
                  Walter Mitty

The group did disband temporarily for reasons dealing with security, but now is
back together.  For other news about this group see the current PWN.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Nihilist Order:  This group was really a loosely connected bunch of friends
                     and phreaks and not a true club.  It is based in Fremont
                     and Sunnyvale, California.  It was started by TRASk and
                     The Highwayman.  The membership includes:

             BelGarion/Ogre Ogre/The Animator/The Highwayman/TRASk

All of the members of the group have been busted or been involved in busts in
the past few months.  The Highwayman bit it in the Phoenix Phortress Sting
Operation, and the others all got caught on a carding scam.  Although BelGarion
was later released with no record.

One of the boards in the Nihilist Order's network is the Shattered World Elite,
which is sysoped by TRASk.  The group is currently inactive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The P.H.I.R.M.:  A somewhat new group that recently has been accused (without
                 proof) of being fed invested.

                 Not much is really known about this group as they would
                 disclose very little information.  Some of the boards that are
                 now P.H.I.R.M operated include Thieve's Underworld, sysoped by
                 Jack The Ripper, World's Grave Elite sysoped by Sir Gamelord,
                 and SATCOM IV.

                 The P.H.I.R.M. reportedly will be releasing a newsletter.

                 The membership of the P.H.I.R.M. supposedly includes:

                    Archangel                  Blade Runner
                    Jack The Ripper            Sir Gamelord
                    The Stingray

                It is rumored that Blade Runner is the same person as
                Archangel and/or The Stingray.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TPM (The Punk Mafia):  This group when last checked had eight members.  The
                       following is a complete listing.

                 Arthur Dent                    Creative Chaos
                 Erik Bloodaxe                  Gin Fizz
                 Ninja NYC                      Peter Gunn
                 Rudolph Smith (703)            The Godfather (703)

The group will be going through a rebirth this summer.  Their main goals
include burglary, fraud, hacking, and phreaking.  Most recently The Godfather
retired and Ninja NYC came very close to being busted.  See Phrack World News
Issue V.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Racketeers:  The new Apple pirating group was assembled by Apple Rebel. The
                 membership now includes:

         Apple Rebel/Crustaceo Mutoid/Hot Rod/The Micron/The Warezird
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tribunal Of Knowledge:  This group was formed very recently by Blue Buccaneer
                        and High Evolutionary with one purpose in mind:  to get
                        together to trade knowledge and information and to
                        discuss this information until all the members had a
                        good working knowledge of it.  The final result would
                        be g-philes written by the group about the topic.  On
                        the whole it was a good idea.

      The complete membership includes:

                    Blue Buccaneer          Chef Boy R Dee
                    Cyclone II              High Evolutionary
                    Night Stalker           Paradox
                    Professor Pixel         Slave Driver
                    The Inspectre           The Seker
                    The Wild Phreak
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2300 Club:  Based in Cleveland, Ohio.  The 2300 Club is now being compared and
            treated as miniature mafia by local authorities.  This is mainly
            for crimes including the blowing up of cars.  Two of the members
            were caught for fraudulent use of a credit card and one has been
            arrested for car theft.  Which of the members that refers to, I
            don't know, but the membership of the 2300 Club included:

                    Dr. Gorey                       Dr. No
                    Eagle Eyes                      Judge Dredd
                    King Blotto                     Mr.  Modem
                    Prince Squid                    Spectreman
                    The Formatter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2600 Club/New 2600 Club:  Both groups are no longer in existence.  Originally
                          started as a local group of friends in St. Louis,
                          Missouri, it gained members quickly, too quickly, and
                          as the membership grew, the unity and productivity of
                          the group lessened until the group(s) finally broke
                          up.  However many of the members of 2600 Club now
                          write (or have in the past) for Phrack Inc.  Among
                          them are:

     Cheap Shades/Data Line/Dr. Crash/Forest Ranger/Gin Fizz/Jester Sluggo
   Knight Lightning/Monty Python/Phantom Phreaker/Taran King/The Clashmaster

                  2600 Club had no relation to 2600 Magazine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Warelords:  There are 13 members in the Warelords and they are based in
            California, Maryland, Tennessee, Washington D.C., and Wyoming.
            Billibuster, a member of the group, said that the Warelords are a
            phreaking and carding group that also writes programs and sells
            them.  He claims that they are not pirates. The group isn't very
            active.

                             The Techno-Revolution

                                      by

                                 Doctor Crash

    Hacking. It is a full time hobby, taking countless hours per week to learn,
experiment, and execute the art of penetrating multi-user computers.  Why do
hackers spend a good portion of their time hacking?  Some might say it is
scientific curiosity, others that it is for mental stimulation.  But the true
roots of hacker motives run much deeper than that.  In this file I will
describe the underlying motives of the aware hackers, make known the
connections between Hacking, Phreaking, Carding, and Anarchy, and make known
the "techno-revolution" which is laying seeds in the mind of every hacker.

    To fully explain the true motives behind hacking, we must first take a
quick look into the past.  In the 1960's, a group of MIT student built the
first modern computer system.  This wild, rebellious group of young men were
the first to bear the name "hackers".  The systems that they developed were
intended to be used to solve world problems and to benefit all of mankind.

    As we can see, this has not been the case.  The computer system has been
solely in the hands of big businesses and the government.  The wonderful device
meant to enrich life has become a weapon which dehumanizes people.  To the
government and large businesses, people are no more than disk space, and the
government doesn't use computers to arrange aid for the poor, but to control
nuclear death weapons.  The average American can only have access to a small
microcomputer which is worth only a fraction of what they pay for it.  The
businesses keep the true state of the art equipment away from the people behind
a steel wall of incredibly high prices and bureaucracy.  It is because of this
state of affairs that hacking was born.

    Hackers realize that the businesses aren't the only ones who are entitled
to modern technology.  They tap into online systems and use them to their own
advantage.  Of course, the government doesn't want the monopoly of technology
broken, so they have outlawed hacking and arrest anyone who is caught.  Even
worse than the government is the security departments of businesses and
companies.  They act as their own "private armies" and their ruthless tactics
are overlooked by the government, as it also serves their needs.

    Hacking is a major facet of the fight against the computer monopoly.  One
of the ways hackers accomplish their means has developed into an art in itself:
Phone Phreaking.  It is essential that every Hacker also be a Phreak, because
it is necessary to utilize the technology of the phone company to access
computers far from where they live.  The phone company is another example of
technology abused and kept from people with high prices.

    Hackers often find that their existing equipment, due to the monopoly
tactics of computer companies, is inefficient for their purposes.  Due to the
inexorbitantly high prices, it is impossible to legally purchase the necessary
equipment.  This need has given still another segment of the fight:  Credit
Carding.  Carding is a way of obtaining the necessary goods without paying for
them.  It is again due to the companies stupidity that Carding is so easy, and
shows that the world's businesses are in the hands of those with considerably
less technical know-how than we, the hackers.

    There is one last method of this war against computer abusers.  This is a
less subtle, less electronic method, but much more direct and gets the message
across.  I am speaking of what is called Anarchy.  Anarchy as we know it does
not refer to the true meaning of the word (no ruling body), but to the process
of physically destroying buildings and governmental establishments.  This is a
very drastic, yet vital part of this "techno-revolution."

    Hacking must continue.  We must train newcomers to the art of hacking.  We
must also increase computer Crashing.  I know that crashing a computer seems a
waste, but when there is no other way to subvert a business, their system must
be shut down.

    As I stated above, this is only on the motives.  If you need a tutorial on
how to perform any of the above stated methods, please read a file on it.  And
whatever you do, continue the fight.  Whether you know it or not, if you are a
hacker, you are a revolutionary.  Don't worry, you're on the right side.

    If you have a question or comment about this file or the "techno-
revolution" just leave mail for me on the Metal Shop AE (314)256-7284, or any
other BBS I may happen to be on.

              "How To Have Fun With a Bic <or generic> Lighter"

       First off, let me say, that I am not responsible for any personal
       damage done by the use of the information in this file.

Shower of sparks from nowhere:
-----------------------------

This trick is done usually with an empty lighter.  Disassemble the top, being
careful not to loose the flint, and the spring, which are under the striker
wheel.  Throw away everything else, unless there is still some fluid in the
lighter, which can be used for some of the other things in this file.  Save the
flint and spring.

Ok, now take the spring, and pull on the end a little, and stretch the spring
out a little longer than the flint.  Next, take the flint, and kind of wrap the
end of the spring around it.  It should look sort of like fig. A.  Next, the
fun part.  Take the spring, and hold it by the end that doesn't have flint on
it, and heat the flint till it glows.  Don't worry, the heat won't burn your
fingers.  Then, throw it flint first at victim, pavement, or whatever.

                           spring                flint


What to do with leftover lighter casing:
---------------------------------------
Light one of the striker wheel supports, and lay it upside down in a corner and
run like hell!  This will blow pretty good.  You can also take the casing and
wrap it loosely in a paper towel, light the towel, step back, and shoot it with
a BB gun.  Fun.  Experiment, but don't ever puncture the lighter, while you're
holding it, that would be foolish.

Summary:  Methods of sabotaging your favorite Unix system.

Preface:  I do not advocate utilizing ANY of the methods I put forth in this
          file.  Unix is a cool operating system, perhaps one of the best
          systems ever designed in many respects.  If you have access to a Unix
          system, you should LEARN UNIX AND LEARN C, because that is where the
          money is in the computer world.  However, Unix is a relatively
          insecure operating system which is easy to fuck up. This file
          explains a few ways of doing so.

Crash The System
----------------
Unix has no built-in provision for the maximum amount of disk space allowed per
user.  Thus, one user can grab all the disk space on the system and effectively
prevent anyone else from writing to the disk.  A simple way of grabbing all the
disk space is to create subdirectory after subdirectory until it is no longer
possible.  Here are a few ways of doing it.

1>  Create a file with the following lines:

mkdir subdir
cd subdir
source /u1/mydir/crash

    Call it crash.  The last line ("source /u1/mydir/crash") should be altered
    so that it will look for the file in your directory.  If your directory is
    /u3/students/jeff, the last line should say "source
    /u3/students/jeff/crash". After you write the above file, type:

% source crash

    and wait...within a few minutes the program will abort because it won't
    have any more room on the disk.  Neither will anyone else.

2>  Here's a more elegant way of doing the same thing.  Create this "endless
    loop" shellscript:

while : ; do
mkdir subdir
cd subdir
done

    and then "source" the file.  If you are in the "sh" shell (if you are, you
    will probably have a "$" prompt) you can type "while : ; do" from the $
    prompt.  You will then get a > prompt.  Type the next three lines and sit
    back.

3>  If you'd like to set the process in motion and hang up, and the file is
    called crash, type:

% nohup source crash &

    and log off.  This will start it as a background process, allowing you to
    log off.  However, log off QUICKLY, since if you used the first example for
    your crash file, it will also eat up background processes like crazy which
    will also fuck up the system to some extent.  Which brings us to...

Slow Down The System Immensely
------------------------------
There are many ways of doing this, the method being creating a sufficiently
large number of background processes.   Here's one specific example.  Create a
file called "slow1" with the following lines:

w &
source slow1

create a file called "slow2" with:

source slow1 &
source slow2

and execute slow2 with

% slow2
or
% slow2 &

This will create 25 background processes, each one running 25 background
processes.  The system will hardly move after you've got each one running.

Messing Up A Directory
----------------------
Many file-handling commands use "-" options.  Create a file with a "-" at the
beginning of its name by doing this:

cat > -filename

[now type a few lines, maybe something rude like "ha ha you can't delete this
file".]  Type a ^D (control-d) to end input.  You now have a file called
-filename in your directory.  It will be VERY difficult to remove this file.
If you were to try rm (remove) -filename or mv (rename) -filename, the rm or mv
program would interpret -filename as an option, not a file, and would give you
an error message telling you that -filename was not a valid option...thus, the
file stays there obnoxiously.

Create a couple of hundred files with "-" as the first characters in their
names...it will be a royal pain for the person who is blessed with these new
files, and they will probably just have to get a new login.

Conclusion

The use of any of these techniques is quite irresponsible, and if anyone did
this to my Unix system, I'd be quite pissed.  That is why I strongly recommend
that you never use these tricks.

So Long,

Ingredients-
    Saltpetre (Potassium Nitrate)
    Sugar
    Alcohol (100% is best, but plain rubbing alcohol will work)
    Gunpowder (or some ground-up rocket engines)
    Matches (Get a box of 50 packs -they can be very useful.)
    Coffee can
    Cigarette

Instructions:
------------
Combine the sugar and saltpetre in a 3:1 ratio (Sugar:saltpetre) and heat
over a low flame until the mixture has thoroughly melted together. (It will
look like sticky white lumps when ready) You need to stir this continually
while heating, and remove it from the flame at the very first sign of smoke. I
had a batch go off in my face once, and the workroom was filled with smoke for
a good half hour. It is easier and safer to work with smaller batches.

Now, dump all of this "smoke powder" into a coffee can, add some match heads,
moisten it with a little alcohol, and add gunpowder until all the smoke powder
is coated. Now tape a cigarette between the match heads in an unopened book.
Imbed the book into the mixture.

Light the but, and walk casually away to find a nice alibi within 5 minutes.

Notes:
-----
You should be able to find some Saltpeter in a local drug store.

All of the gunpowder, match heads, and alcohol is simply to insure good
ignition. You can omit them, but if you have them, mix them in for
reliability's sake. For the fuse, you can either use the one listed, or either
some canon fuse, or a rocket igniter and an electrical system.

A quarter pound of this stuff is supposed to fill a city block. I'm not sure if
that is accurate, but it sure fills a public bathroom nicely.

                              Cellular Telephones
                      [Written By The High Evolutionary]

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

    I assume that most of us know many of the technical aspects of Cellular
Phreaking therefore this file is intended for general information as to how
these unique devices operate.

        --------------------------------------------------------------

    Cellular is likely to be successful because it provides dramatic
improvements over the historic automobile phones.  For years, mobile
radio-telephone service was an extremely limited proposition.  There were only
forty-four radio channels available, and a maximum of about thirty were
assigned to any one area.  That meant if all thirty channels were occupied-one
conversation per channel-and you were the thirty-first mobile phone user who
wished to make a call, you would have to wait thirty minutes or more, even in a
city the size of New York.  As you can imagine, mobile radio-telephone service
like that could not become very popular.  Even with the limited number of
channels, long delays in making calls during busy periods, and often poor
quality transmission, there were big waiting lists for mobile service.  But
with a fully equipped cellular radio-telephone system, it is possible to make
5000 times as many calls simultaneously in the same metropolitan area, opening
up the service to anyone that can pay the hefty prices.

    That is because cellular radio-telephones systems are technically quite
different from traditional mobile telephones.  First, the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission) has allocated far more channels to cellular, 666 in
all.  Second, those 666 channels are broadcast from many different locations.
In the old mobile telephone systems, there was one powerful radio station with
a large antenna that served an entire city.  In the new system, a geographical
area is honeycombed with many cells, hence the name 'Cellular'.  Each cell has
its own low-powered radio transmitter and receiver. As a car with a cellular
telephone or a person carrying a portable moves from one cell to the next, the
call is transferred automatically.  You're unlikely to notice when this
transfer takes place, even though your phone is suddenly switched to a
different radio station and to another channel while you are talking.

    Because the cellular signal is low-powered, it doesn't go very far.  This
permits the same channel you are talking on to be used for calls in other parts
of the same metropolitan area without interference.  This would mean cellular
radio-telephone systems can serve a very large number of customers in an area
because there are more channels than before-and the larger number of channels
are reused.

    Unlike local telephone service, which is provided by a monopoly, there is
competition in cellular.  Two classes of companies are allowed to offer
cellular telephone service in every market.  One cellular system can be owned
by a telephone company, the other by someone else.  The two-company rule was
adopted by the FCC so that AT&T, which developed cellular, could not monopolize
the whole thing.

    Cellular Telephones come in two basic versions, as car phones and portable
phones, with a briefcase hybrid.  Car phones are by far the most common,
because they are much cheaper.  But most believe that, ultimately, portables
will be the most popular.  Washington Post Company president Richard Simmons,
whose company is a partner in several cellular systems, even predicts that by
the early 1990's "There will be phones roughly the size of a calculators that
you carry around in your pocket.  They will cost no more than five hundred
dollars.  They will emancipate people from the necessity of locating a phone to
make calls. The bad news is, you will never be able to get away from the phone,
and we'll call it progress."

    Car telephones include a small transmitter-receiver unit that is usually
mounted in the trunk, an antenna and a control head that includes the handset.
In most cellular systems, the telephone touchpad is located on the handset.
Many domestic and foreign manufacturers make cellular car phones, but so far
only Motorola makes portables, the DYNA T-A-C 8000X and 8000S. Motorola's
portables look like a slightly enlarged, somewhat chunky telephone handset,
with a stubby antenna at one end.

    Portables are less powerful than car units, so they can't be used with some
cellular systems.  The portable's other limitation is battery life.  A portable
can listen for calls for about eight hours, but it can only transmit for only
thirty minutes.  After that time it must be charged for a minimum of an hour.

get it:

It is best if you read both files to better understand each other.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     These files will cover general information on wide-area networks, (I.E.
ARPANET, CSNET, BITNET, MFENET, UUCP and USENET), but may contain information
in relationship with other networks not emphasized in these files.  These files
are NOT a hacker's tutorial/guide on these systems.

                                    BITNET
                                    ~~~~~~
BITNET.  In 1981, City University of New York (CUNY) surveyed universities on
the East Coast of the U.S. and Canada, inquiring whether there was interest in
creating and easy-to-use, economical network for interuniversity communication
between scholars.  The response was positive.  Many shared the CUNY belief in
the importance of computer-assisted communication between scholars.  The first
link of the new network, called BITNET, was established between CUNY and Yale
University in May 1981.
     The network technology chosen for BITNET was determined by the
availability of the RSCS software on the IBM computers at the initial sites.
[The name BITNET stands for Because It's Time NETwork.]  The RSCS software is
simple but effective, and most IBM VM-CMS computer systems have it installed
for local communications, supporting file transfer and remote job entry
services.  The standard BITNET links are leased telephone lines running at 9600
bps.  Although all the initial nodes were IBM machines in university computer
centers, the network is in no way restricted to such systems.  Any computer
with an RSCS emulator can be connected to BITNET.  Emulators are available for
DEC VAX-VMS systems, VAX-UNIX systems, and for Control Data Corp. Cyber systems
and others.  Today, more than one-third of the computers on BITNET are non-IBM
systems.
     BITNET is a store-and-forward network with files and messages sent from
computer to computer across the network.  It provides electronic mail, remote
job entry, and file transfer services, and supports and interactive message
facility and a limited remote logon facility.  Most BITNET sites use the same
electronic mail procedures and standards as the ARPANET, and as a result of the
installation of electronic mail gateway systems at the University of California
at Berkley and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, most BITNET users can
communicate electronically with users on CSNET and the ARPANET.
     BITNET has expanded extremely rapidly -- a clear indication that is
providing service that people need and want.  The simplicity of the connection
to the network -- acquiring a 9600-bps leased line to the nearest neighboring
computer node and in installing an additional line interface and modem --
provides the service at the right price.  By the end of 1985 the number of
computers connected was expected to exceed 600, at more than 175 institutions
of higher education throughout the U.S.  BITNET is open without restriction to
any college or university.  It is not limited to specific academic disciplines,
and may be used for any academic purpose.  However, use for commercial purposes
is prohibited.  In special cases, connection of commercial organizations may be
sponsored by universities.  A particular case is the connection of Boeing
Computer Services to BITNET, as part of the NSFnet initiative, to provide
remote job entry services to their Cray X-MP/24 to NSF supercomputer grantees
who have access to BITNET.
     Until recently BITNET had no central management structure, and was
coordinated by an executive board consisting of members from the major
institutions participating.  This worked because most of the computers
connected were managed and operated by professional service organizations in
university computer centers.  However, the growth in the network made it
possible to continue in this ad hoc fashion, and a central support organization
was established with support from an IBM grant.  The central support
organization, called the BITNET network support center (BITNSC), has two parts:
A user services organization, the network information center (BITNSC), which
provides user support, a name server and a variety of databases, and the
development and operations center (BITDOC) to develop and operate the network.
A major question facing the members of BITNET is how the funding of this
central organization will be continued when the IBM grant expires in 1987.
     BITNET, with support from the NSFnet Program, is now examining ways to
provide ARPANET-like services to existing BITNET sites.  The project, which is
similar to the CSNET CYPRESS project, will explore a strategy to provide an
optional path to the use of the TCP-IP procedures on existing 9.6-kbps leased
lines.  The possibility of upgrading these lines to multiple alternate links,
providing higher reliability and availability, or to higher speed 56-kbps links
is also being studied.  The project will offer a higher level of service to
BITNET sites choosing this path and also enable a low-cost connection to
NSFnet.

                                    MFENET
                                    ~~~~~~
MFENET.  The DOE's magnetic fusion energy research network was established in
the mid-1970's to support access to the MFE Cray 1 supercomputer at the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  The network uses 56-kbs satellite
links, and is designed to provide terminal access to the Cray time-sharing
system (CTSS), also developed at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.  The
network currently supports access to Cray 1, Cray X-MP/2, Cray 2, and Cyber 205
supercomputers.  The network uses special-purpose networking software developed
at Livermore, and, in addition to terminal access, provides file transfer,
remote output queuing, and electronic mail, and includes some specialized
application procedures supporting interactive graphics terminals and local
personal computer (PC)-based editing.  Access to the network is in general
restricted to DOE-funded researchers.  Recently the network has been expanded
to include the DOE-funded supercomputer at Florida State University. MFENET is
funded by DOE and managed by Livermore.
     MFENET has been successful in supporting DOE supercomputer users. However,
the specialized nature of the communications protocols is now creating
difficulties for researchers who need advanced graphics workstations that use
the UNIX BSD 4.2 operating system and the TCP-IP protocols on LAN's. For these
and other reasons, DOE is examining how best to migrate MFENET to the TCP-IP,
and later to the OSI, protocols.
     The combination of the CTSS operating system and the MFENET protocols
creates an effective interactive computing environment for researchers using
Cray supercomputers.  For this reason, two of the new NSF national
supercomputer centers -- San Diego (SDSC) and Illinois -- have chosen the CTSS
operating system.  In SDSC's case, the MFENET protocols have also been chosen
to support the SDSC Consortium network.  In Illinois case, a project to
implement the TCP-IP protocols for the CTSS operating system has been funded by
the NSFnet program, and these developments will be shared with SDSC (and with
DOE) to provide a migration path for the SDSC Consortium network.

                                UUCP and USENET
                                ~~~~     ~~~~~~
UUCP and USENET.  The UUCP network was started in the 1970's to provide
electronic mail and file transfer between UNIX systems.  The network is a
host-based store-and-forward network using dialup telephone circuits and
operates by having each member site dialup the next UUCP host computer and send
and receive files and electronic mail messages.  The network uses addresses
based on the physical path established by this sequence of dialups connections.
UUCP is open to any UNIX system which chooses to participate.  There are
"informal" electronic mail gateways between UUCP and ARPANET, BITNET, or CSNET,
so that users of any of these networks can exchange electronic mail.
     USENET is a UNIX news facility based on the UUCP network that provides a
news bulletin board service.  Neither UUCP nor USENET has a central management;
volunteers maintain and distribute the routing tables for the network.  Each
member site pays its own costs and agrees to carry traffic. Despite this
reliance on mutual cooperation and anarchic management style, the network
operates and provides a useful, if somewhat unreliable, and low-cost service to
its members.  Over the years the network has grown into a world-wide network
with thousands of computers participating.

                                    ~~~~~~
Other Wide-Area Networks.  Of necessity this file of wide-area networks has
been incomplete: Other networks of interest include the Space Plasma Analysis
Network (SPAN) -- a network of DEC VAX computers using 9.6-kbps links and the
DECNET protocols for National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
researchers; the planned Numerical and Atmospheric Sciences (NAS) network

high-energy physics network -- a network based largely on VAX computers and
using the standard X.25 network level protocols plus the so called "coloured
books" protocols developed in the United Kingdom.  Also, many high-energy
physicists, at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, at the Lawrence Berkley
Laboratory, and at Fermi Laboratory, among others, have used DECNET to connect
their DEC VAX computers together.

Where is Taran King?                                               May 10, 1986
--------------------
Taran King is generally thought to be a very mellow, easy going person.  For
the most part this is true.  However he also gets into major fights with his
dad. When Taran does get pissed he, gets violent.  In the past he has punched a
hole into his bedroom door and put dents in his refrigerator with his fists.

Most recently his dad found out about his collection of illegal knives,
including stilettos, butterflies, and survival knives.  They got into an
argument about this and eventually into a fight.  Taran stormed off to his
room.  Meanwhile, unknown to him, his dad called the police.  They took him to
a nearby hospital's adolescent psychiatric ward, supposedly for evaluation.  As
of June 14, 1986 he has been there for five weeks and the end isn't in sight.

For a while he had no phone of visitor privileges and there was no way of
contacting him.  This now has changed, but the problems have not been solved.

On May 23, 1986 he was let out on a pass to go see Judas Priest in concert (it
was great).  He has been let out on pass several times since then as well,
mostly on weekends.

As far as Metal Shop Private...

Well on May 12, 1986, the /\/impha and I decided to go to Taran's house to
collect the Phrack files and to add a few new modifications to the bbs so that
I could control it better remotely.  Taran's sister let us in, no problem.
Unfortunately, before we were done Taran's dad came home.  He immediately
spotted my car outside and burst into the house.  He was pissed that we were
there and made sure we weren't stealing anything (like I am really going to
steal from my best friend right?).  He assumed that the bbs had crashed and
that we were there fixing it.  He then decided that he didn't want us to come
over every time the board crashed and TOOK IT DOWN!

Metal Shop Private will return when Taran gets out, hopefully sometime in June.

Mark Tabas and Karl Marx Busted                                     May 2, 1986
-------------------------------
The story goes like this; Mark Tabas was working at a plant in Denver where
credit card blanks are manufactured.  He decided to take a few.  He and Karl
Marx then went about finding someone with an embossing machine to print some
stuff onto the blanks.  They were able to find someone and agreed to meet at a
motel to do the work.  Everything went well.  They were able to print card
numbers, names, and expiration dates that they had gotten onto the blanks.  To
celebrate they ordered a bottle of champagne from room service, and paid for it
with one of the cards.  At that point the guy with the embosser pulled his
badge, Secret Service!  Now Mark Tabas and Karl Marx are facing forgery and
carding charges along with theft for the blanks.

               Information provided by Sally Ride...Space Cadet

(Editor's Note:  At the time that this information was gained, Sally Ride
 commented that it may be a rumor.  Any inconsistencies are not his fault)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   May 15, 1986

We at Phrack have since uncovered more information about this bust.  Apparently
a guy named Will Bell, who's handle was Jack Bell, set up Karl Marx and Mark
Tabas.  Will Bell had the embossing machine and was not a member of the Secret
Service.  Instead, he was the son of a member of the Secret Service (although
maybe he was the son of a member of the FBI).  Since he was not a fed, this was
not a case of entrapment.  It is believed that Will/Jack Bell is originally
from the 312 (Chicago) area.

FBI/Wylon In Action
-------------------
On May 2, 1986, the homes of Cheap Shades and Kleptic Wizard received visits
from Edward P. Nowicki, Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

This was not a bust in any way.  This agent was trying to gain evidence for a
telecommunications company known as Wylon, which is mainly based in the
Colorado/Wyoming area.  Apparently someone or several people had been calling
Kleptic Palace AE and Metal Shop AE illegally and Mr. Nowicki wanted to know
who had been placing these calls.

As far as Kleptic Palace AE, the calls in question were made on 2/9/86 5:12 AM,
2/9/86 4:33 PM, and 2/10/86 7:30 AM.  Although no specific order is mentioned.
The times of the calls made to Metal Shop AE are not available.  A third place
called was the home of TWCB Inc.  At the time of these calls Whackoland was
still up.

The agent expected all of them to have a caller log on the board but of course
neither of their AEs kept caller logs.  Not to mention the fact that no one
would kept a caller log for three months anyway.

Kleptic Wizard got a message to Taran King which was then sent to me, and
within the hour I arrived at Klepto's house where I discovered the FBI still
around, so after killing another 45 minutes, I went inside and met with Klepto.
Mr. Nowicki had left behind two things, his business card and a list of four
suspects that he was specifically trying to bust.  Apparently all four had been
caught for Wylon abuse in the past.

I recognized the name at the top of the list almost instantly and as a result,
saved a fellow phreak from a possible bust.  Two of the others are rumored to
have been warned as well.  However if this is untrue then the other three still
may be in great danger as of this writing.  All of the suspects live in the
Wyoming/Colorado area.

The homes of Cheap Shades and Kleptic Wizard were not searched and their boards
were not looked at.  The FBI agent even declined an invitation from Kleptic
Wizard to see the bbs.  This may be because he didn't have a warrant.

Administration Nominations?                                         May 6, 1986
---------------------------
In late April 1986, The Administration decided to have their yearly membership
drive for the group. The phreaks/hackers being voted on for membership
included:

     Blade Runner/Jester Sluggo/Knight Lightning/Oryan Quest/Phlash Gordon
         Recent Change/Sally Ride/Slave Driver/Taran King/The Marauder

Many of the above and others had thought that they had been voted into the
Administration without even being asked.  However this was not the case.

David Lightman stated that the nominations were made public so that the
Administration members would know of the vote taking place on Administration
BBS
1.  Once the nominations were voted on, then the phreaks/hacks would be
formally invited.

I now pose an important question.  If David Lightman is the only regular board
caller of the Administration, then how would the other members know how to
vote?

So far the results of the votes have not been made public.  Not that it matters
that much because The Administration has now more or less completely fallen
apart.  It would appear that this new membership drive was an attempt to revive
the group with new blood.  However the group has been revived on its own, since
the formers members regrouped again...at least temporarily.

----------------
In the last week of May, David Lightman, decided to do a credimatic check on
Blade Runner.  To his great surprise, he found that Blade Runner worked for
Southwestern Bell Security.  He confronted Blade Runner with this information
and shortly afterward received a visit from Southwestern Bell Security, who
confiscated his terminal programs, his user files, notebooks, and g-phile
disks. He claims that his user files and g-philes were scrambled so no one
should worry too much.

Later that day, Sir Gamelord, sysop of World's Grave Elite, called David
Lightman and said that Blade Runner was on the board and acting really strange.
David Lightman told him what happened and they then hung up.  The next day
Blade Runner is a cosysop of World's Grave Elite as well as Thieve's
Underground, sysoped by Jack The Ripper.  Now Sir Gamelord denies the incident
ever occurred.  At this writing, David Lightman is laying low and retiring from
the phreak world until things clear up.

Sir Gamelord's side to this story is quite different.  Sir Gamelord said that
he, Blade Runner, and Jack the Ripper were forming a group called the
P.H.I.R.M. (see Phrack Pro-Phile 3 this issue) and that Lightman wanted to be
in and to lead the group as a subsidiary of The Administration (like Team
Hackers'86).  They refused, and took away his cosysop access on their boards.
Sir Gamelord says that Lightman is making this whole Southwestern Bell Security
story up to get revenge on them.

However, Lightman claims that he was asked to be a member of The P.H.I.R.M.,
but refused because he didn't have the time.  He did however recommend Digital
Logic, Ford Prefect, and The Lineman (sysop of the Lost City Of Atlantis).

David Lightman has since received his disks back but will not be around on
boards very much. The decision is up to you.  I will try to get more
information out on boards as soon as possible.

Ninja NYC/Sigmund Fraud; Close Calls
------------------------------------
Sigmund Fraud, famous for his incredible proficiency at "social engineering" is
now laying incredibly low after what is considered the closest call of his
life.

The following must be regarded as pure rumor for the sake of non-incrimination
of those involved.  You readers know what I mean.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The story goes like this, Sigmund Fraud and a friend (the same one who went to
the Telepub'86 meeting in New York, however he has no handle) were able to
convince their local Bell company that they were another part of the same
company and were able to acquire; Call Forwarding, Call Waiting, Speed Calling,
and Three Way Calling on to Sigmud Fraud's personal phone line.  Since SF's
friend lived in a Cross Bar (X-Bar) area he could not get these services so
they decided to get them for Ninja NYC.  They told him about it later.

Less than a week later, on the first Thursday of May 1986, Ninja NYC came home
to discover 2 telco agents awaiting his return from school.  What it boiled
down to was that "he" had committed several felonies and to make matters worse,
the people at the local Bell company identified Ninja NYC's voice as being the
caller, AND HE ISN'T THE ONE WHO MADE THE CALL!!!!   What it finally boiled
down to was that Ninja NYC had really received a very scary personal warning.

About this same time Sigmund Fraud is getting home and to his great dismay, all
of his new found phone features have been turned off!!?!  Sometime later (most
likely after the telco agents had left) Sigmund gets a call from Ninja NYC.
Ninja NYC of course tells him everything that had happened and warned him that
he was next.  Sigmund immediately called me.  We both thought Sigmund was
doomed and would be picked up very soon.

However this was not the case. The agents didn't show up and Sigmund had been
given a golden opportunity to dump all his illegal items and get his story
right.  That night I received a call from Slave Driver and Sigmund call me on
three-way and we discussed what to do next.  The problem was that Sigmund
didn't want to get rid of his illegal items.  He had boxes, manuals, notebooks,
and even a PBX in his room.  I told he had 2 choices; Choice A:  SF gets rid of
his shit somewhere anywhere, and the telcos don't get any more evidence or,
Choice B:  SF leaves the stuff where it is, the telcos come over and take it
and SF gets nailed worse.

When I left the conversation SF was still discussing what he should do.  The
next day, he was not visited by the telcos, he was not busted, but instead
received a call from his local bell company and was given a very strong verbal
warning.

Since that time, He has stopped answering his personal phone and believes that
line to be monitored.  Ninja NYC is almost definitely being monitored and
people have been asked not to call him.

Of course that didn't stop Daniel Zigmond from calling him.  This was in an
attempt to help Sigmund Fraud, but regardless may have done more damage than
good.

Captain Midnight's Sneak Attack                                    May 12, 1986
-------------------------------
               "A daring intruder airs the beefs of dish owners"

In the old days, people with complaints against the media had few recourses:
A stern letter to the editor, perhaps, or a protesting phone call.  "Captain
Midnight," an outraged consumer of the space age, took more daring action.  In
a sneak attack made on Sunday of last week, the self-appointed video avenger
broke into an HBO presentation of the movie "The Falcon and the Snowman" with a
cryptic message:

                               Good evening HBO
                             From Captain Midnight
                            $12.95/Month?   No Way!
                      (Showtime/The Movie Channel Beware)

The mysterious dispatch, seen for several minutes in the East and Midwest by
hundreds of thousands of subscribers to the pay-cable service, was clearly
intended as a rallying cry for the more than 1.5 million owners of home
satellite dishes in the U.S.  These video free-lancers are angry because many
of the TV signals they have been plucking from the sky are done by one tuning
into jumble.  In January, HBO and Cinemax (both owned by Time Inc.) became the
first two cable services to scramble their signals, thus preventing dish owners
from watching them without paying a monthly subscription fee.  Showtime and the
Movie Channel will begin similar scrambling on May 27, and most other
satellite-beamed cable channels, including ESPN, MTV, the Disney Channel, Cable
News Network and Superstation WTBS, will follow suit before the end of the
year.  Their actions have set off a heated battle over just who has the right
to TV signals bouncing through the skies.

In one blow, Captain Midnight has become a folk hero in that struggle, though
his identity remains a mystery.  Ordinary home dishes are able only to receive
signals, not to send them; thus experts think the pirate signal probably came
from a TV station or other commercial facility.  Wherever the stunt
originated, TV executives were not amused.  HBO has lodged a complaint with the
FCC, threatened to prosecute the pirate, and made technical adjustments that it
claims will prevent any repeat attack.

"He probably thinks this was a prank," says HBO Vice President Dave Pritchard.
"But the fact is someone has interfered with authorized satellite
transmissions." The incident has raised concerns that other satellite-borne
communications, including sensitive data transmitted by business and the
military, could be similarly disrupted.  Representatives of the three broadcast
networks insist that a 'hacker' would have difficulty breaking into their
programming.  But any satellite signal could theoretically be disrupted,
experts say "Most satellites are built with some safety measures," explains
Karl Savatiel, director of satellite communications for AT&T.  "But all
satellites, including military satellites, are vulnerable if a person knows
where the satellite is located, the frequency it uses for satellite
transmissions, and the sender's code."

News On Captain Midnight                                         April 28, 1986
------------------------
             "Search for Cable TV Prankster Leads to North Texas"

The search for Captain Midnight, the disgruntled video prankster who briefly
commandeered Home Box Office's satellite transmissions over the eastern
two-thirds of the country early Sunday, has led federal investigators to North
Texas, a Justice Department official said Monday.

John K. Russell, a Justice Department spokesman in Washington, told
Knight-Ridder Newspapers that "the perpetrator is believed to be in North
Texas."  Later he said the search was in Texas "as well as other areas."

Other authorities told Knight-Ridder that investigators in the Dallas field
offices of the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have been
focusing on a tip that Sunday's four-minute cable interruption originated in
North Texas.

FBI and FCC officials in Dallas could not be reached for comment Monday.

Captain Midnight interrupted a movie broadcast Sunday with a message protesting
new fees being charged the owners of satellite dishes for access to HBO.  The
five line message, superimposed on a test pattern, said:

                   "Good evening HBO from Captain Midnight.
                           $12.95 a month?  No way!
                       (Showtime-Movie Channel Beware.)"

In January, HBO began scrambling its broadcasts to prevent owners of satellite
dishes from unauthorized interception of the signal as it bounced from a
satellite to cable television systems.

HBO told dish owners that they would have to buy a descrambler for $395 and
pay $12.95 a month.

"While the man on the street may have once thought that Captain Midnight's
message was limited to being a prank, it does represent a very serious threat
to any company or entity using satellites to transmit information," said Alan
Levi, HBO's manager of corporate public relations.

David Lightman:

I have spoken with several people about 'Captain Midnight'.  I have spoken to
everyone above.  This David Pritchard tried to tell me this:

DP = David Pritchard
DL = David Lightman
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DL:  Where do you think this 'Captain Midnight' is?

DP:  Would assume he is in the North Texas region.  Possibly 214.

DL:  What makes you think this?

DP:  We believe this is true due to a tip from a Dallas resident.

DL:  How do you know that he was not lying to lead you away from the real
     Captain Midnight?

DP:  I know he was probably not lying because he left us his mailbox number.

DL:  Which is?

DP:  I cannot release that information right now.

      (This conversation went on for a while. Possibly 10-15 minutes...)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Lightman earlier had spoken with Alan Levi...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DL:  Yes.  Do you have any idea who this Captain Midnight might be?

Alan:  No, but we are fairly certain it is someone in the 212 area with access
       to the scrambling offices of HBO.  The knowledge necessary for what
       this guy did could not be gotten very easily without getting it from our
       departments.

DL:  Well, I believe I know who this Captain Midnight is.

Alan:  Could you please tell me who you think Captain Midnight is?

DL:  No.  If it is the person I suspect, I would rather not cause any trouble
     for them.

Alan:  You wouldn't cause much trouble for him.

DL:  Isn't what this guy did a federal offense?

Alan:  Well, yes it is, but you would be surprised how many people get away
       with breaking federal laws.

                         (He actually said that guys!)

DL:  Hmm....  What would happen to him?

Alan:  We would just let him know that what he did was not a prank.  It was
       very serious.  It could possibly change the entire industry and unless
       he stops transmitting over our satellites, we will ask the Department of
       Defense to handle it from then on.

DL:  Well, I would need to think about it a little more.  Can I call you back a
     little later?

Alan:  Could you just give me your number and I will have David Pritchard call
       you back?

DL:  It depends on who else will get my number.

Alan:  Just me.  I will consider this conversation and all of the conversations
       that follow to be an anonymous tip.

DL:  Sure then.  It is (214) 733-5162.

Alan:  Thanks.  Then I will have David call you if you do not call me back
       before tomorrow evening.

DL:  That would be fine.  Thanks.

Alan:  Thank you.
------------------------------End of Conversation------------------------------
Well as you may have guessed, my number (mailbox) was given to the FCC, FBI,
and David Pritchard as well as Tim Larker.  I got pretty pissed so I called
David Pritchard.  That was the first conversation I posted.  We (Alan Levi,
David Pritchard, Tim Larker, the FCC, the FBI, Knight-Ridder Newspapers, and I)
now have the country believing that the transmission originated in Dallas.  Of
course it did, but you may see that changed soon.  I plan on another
conversation with these intelligent people tomorrow 5:00 PM.

If you do call these guys, please do not mention the Administration, Team
Hackers'86, any member of either group or me to them as being the transmitter.
You have no proof at all about that.  I did not say if we were involved or not.
That will be left up to your imagination.

Captain Midnight Busted!                                           June 6, 1986
------------------------
Captain Midnight probably isn't sleeping too well these days.  His name, still
publicly unannounced, is probably known by many, including the FBI.  He has
already been reported to have been fired from his job at an uplink facility, of
which there are only around 100 in this country.  The facility is east of the
Rockies and does not operate after midnight.  Also, a newer type of equipment
was used of which there are only a few in the country.  We expect charges to be
filed any day now, possibly just in time for the June 12th congressional
hearings on signal jamming.  Penalties could include a one year jail sentence
and up to $50,000 in fines; $10,000 maximum of which would be for jamming only.

We expect FM America to come to Captain Midnight's rescue financially by
raising defense money.  All segments of the TVRO industry condemned the signal
jamming.  It is interesting to note the grins and smiles while discussing the
subject, however, FM America knows who "Captain Midnight" is and even
interviewed him live on the air on "FM America."  Tapes of FM America including
Captain Midnight's interview have been turned over to federal investigators.

Several benefits can be realized by Captain Midnight's signal "interruption."
Mainly, the fact is now known by everyone that it can be done.  There are no
secrets either in that a transponder can easily be confused into locking onto
another signal and ignoring the correct signal as interference.  Also, the
signal that controls the satellite's positioning could also be accessed.  The
overall possibility that our entire "satellite system" in general can be
rendered ineffective from the ground is kind of unnerving.

Signal scrambling did not interfere with the HBO signal lockout because a
higher wattage beam over-powered it.  The networks all use pretty powerful
beams which are used 24 hours-a-day so they would be harder to jam.  If we had
to guess which uplink was used to jam HBO, we would pick one that was already
locked into the same satellite, such as one of the superstations. (Hint, Hint!)

Who is Ralph Meola?                                                May 20, 1986
-------------------
Ralph Meola is the Head of AT&T Security in New Jersey and theoretically
everywhere else as well.  He is known to have a computer file on hackers and
phreaks, and an investigative team, that rivals John Maxfield's "BoardScan".

How did Meola enter into the public eye?  Well, we at Phrack really aren't
completely sure but, the general idea is that a friend of Sigmund Fraud (See
TelePub'86 in PWN issue III), using social engineering in order to gain
information from AT&T, somehow came into contact with Ralph Meola.

Later, Sigmund Fraud was also brought into this and decided to give Ralph Meola
a call himself.  With Gin Fizz on Sigmund's 3-Way, he got Meola on the phone
and said,"Hey! This is Sigmund Fraud!"  Typing sounds could be heard in the
background and in a few seconds Meola responded with Sigmund Fraud's real name,
address, phone numbers, and the names of several BBSes that he was on.

Meola then insisted that Sigmund Fraud give him his account on Stronghold East
or at the very least, all of the newuser logon procedures and passwords.
Failure to do so would mean big trouble for Sigmund Fraud.  Sigmund of course
gave Meola the always nice "fuck you!" and hung up on Meola.

Although Sigmund Fraud was (at the time) on Metal Shop Private, Meola didn't
know it, or at least he didn't mention it as a BBS that Sigmund was on.  This
means that Meola has no agents on Metal Shop Private.  It is also known that
Meola has no agents on Stronghold East.  Otherwise he wouldn't have needed the
password information from Sigmund.  It is believed that Meola was on Stronghold
East before the MASSIVE purge several months ago.

TO:  Ralph Meeola
     Head AT&T Security

From: Slave Driver

Re: My user.

   Hello.  I find it rather hard to get in touch with you through normal
means, but give me some time.

   I was told you have been threatening my users, trying to get access here.
That is not good.  Ralph, if you want access just ask for it, don't go
threatening my users.  That was not an intelligent idea, Ralph.

   If you are such a big guy [in your mind, and uh, hand] why not give me a
call.  I'm sure you have my number.  I would be very interested in talking to
you.  So, you decide, Ralph.  Either way, we'll talk one day.

                       Bye Ralph,

                       Slave Driver

Cracking Down On Abuse
----------------------
This article is from the January issue of MCI World, a monthly newsletter
published by MCI for it's employees.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The nationwide attack on telephone fraud got a boost recently when the U.S.
Secret Service joined the effort to curb the crime that costs the industry
millions in lost revenue annually.

The Secret Service used new jurisdiction over the telephone fraud for the first
time to arrest five individuals in raids on four illegal "Call-Sell" operations
in New York City last November.

The five suspects are awaiting trial in federal court on charges based on a
Secret Service investigation conducted in cooperation with MCI and other
members of the long distance telephone industry.

The defendants were charged with violation of a law on Fraud In Connection With
Access Devices which carries maximum penalties of 15 years imprisonment and a
fine of $50,000, or twice the value of the fraudulent activity.

Several other investigations are under way and future arrests are expected,
according to a Secret Service spokesman.

MCI cooperated in the investigation as a company and through membership in the
Communications Fraud Control Association (CFCA), made up of some 35 telephone
industry firms.

"Because it's an industry-wide problem, we have organized to crack down on all
kinds of fraud, from the isolated 'hacker' to more organized schemes to use
long distance lines illegally," said Everick Bowens, senior manager of MCI
security investigations and president of CFCA.

The Secret Service said that in the New York cases, the defendants operated
Call-Sell businesses out of their homes and charged "customers" a flat fee for
making long distance calls.  They used "Blue Boxes" and stolen or compromised
authorization codes or credit card numbers to use the long-distance networks
of several companies.

Blue Boxes are electronic tone-generating devices used to bypass billing
systems and gain access to company networks.  They can be assembled from
generally available electronic parts or they can be purchased ready-made
through illegal sources.

In the New York raids, agents seized unauthorized cods and credit card numbers,
four Blue Boxes and more than 20 telephones.

It is estimated that in 1984, fraud in the telecommunications industry totaled
$500 million nationwide, and approximately $70 million in the New York City
area.

CFCA members are primarily inter-exchange carriers, such as MCI, but resale
carriers and some Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) are also members, along with
representatives of computer services and credit card companies.

Bowens says CFCA is intensifying efforts to stop the spread of fraud.  Among
other things, CFCA is developing educational packages for carriers and the
public to promote widespread understanding of telephone fraud and ways to
counter the crime.

"Our aim is jointly to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute any
fraudulent use of our long-distance networks," Bowens said.

Authorization codes are obtained by theft from individuals and by "hackers" who
randomly try combinations of numbers by telephone or through computer scanning
of number combinations until a working code is "hit."  Illegally obtained codes
are fraudulently used by "boiler room" telemarketing operations, for example,
or are passed along for use by individuals.

MCI had developed software to detect illegal entry into its network and it is
expected that the spread of dial 1 service, in which authorization codes are
not used, will help reduce the incidence of telephone fraud.

The Many Faces Of Fraud
-----------------------
The following is an article from the January issue of MCI World, a monthly
newsletter published by MCI for it's employees.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This new year will see a stepped up MCI attack on telephone fraud--illegal use
of the long distance network through access by stolen authorization codes or
electronic devices.  The offensive is led by Everick Bowens, senior manager of
MCI's security investigations department and president of the industry-wide
Communications Fraud Control Association (CFCA).  Success in curbing this theft
of service has earned MCI security investigators a reputation as super sleuths
at headquarters and in the divisions.

New teeth were added to the attack on telephone fraud when the U.S. Secret
Service was assigned to augment continuing investigative efforts by the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies.

Because telephone fraud is outright theft from the company, MCI is determined
to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute any illicit use of its network.
To learn more about how MCI conducts its anti-fraud campaign, MCI World talked
with Bowens.

MCI World: Is it true that MCI has systems that can detect fraudulent activity
           while it is occurring?

Bowens: Yes, our fraud systems detect abnormal usage and hacking.  The systems
        also help us to track down offenders even when we have only the
        authorization code he or she is abusing.  Because we can profile
        abusers and trace phone calls, it is easier for us to prepare cases
        for prosecution.

MCI World: Abuses involving computer "hacking" to get authorization codes seem
           to attract public attention.  But there are other types of fraud
           equally damaging to the telecommunications industry.  Would you
           identify some of these?

Bowens: The primary form of abuse is by "hackers," who use computer programs to
        derive customers' authorization codes.  These codes can be widely
        disseminated via electronic bulletin boards.  Because many of these
        boards are public, the codes fall into the hands of anyone with access
        to the boards.  We also encounter electronic toll fraud, which involves
        tone-generating devices that allow offenders to place fraudulent calls.

MCI World: Is one type of fraudulent activity more prevalent than another?

Bowens: Nationwide, fraud most frequently originates from military posts,
        college campuses, and prisons--places where there are numbers of people
        far from home, or who have little else to do but manipulate the
        telephone.  This type of abuse prompts the bulk of our investigations.

MCI World: Who is most likely to commit fraud?  Is there a general profile of
           the common offender?

Bowens: Computer crime typically occurs in affluent, metropolitan suburbs
        and involves juveniles.  Electronic fraud also occurs in major
        metropolitan areas.  Other abusers, such as high-pressure
        tele-marketeers, usually follow the coast lines.  California and
        Florida, for "boiler room" operations in which phone service is used
        illegally to sell merchandise.  However, fraud can't be totally
        attributed to any specific group at any particular time.

MCI World: How can you keep up with code abuse and fraud?  Don't offenders
           change frequently?

Bowens: Interestingly enough, the patterns don't change much.  Those who commit
        fraud form a finite community that doesn't expand a great a great deal
        over time.  Casual offenders, individuals who may take advantage of a
        "hot" toll free number, will use the number only when it's hot.  Once
        the number no longer works, they're not likely to repeat the offense.
        On the other hand, repeat offenders are dedicated to getting something
        for nothing.  They're somewhat easier to identify because they commit
        the same offense over and over.

MCI World: How does MCI know when it is the target of fraudulent activity?

Bowens: Our systems generally alert us, or an employee or a customer informs
        us.  People know the MCI name.  When they recognize something happening
        illegally with an authorization code, they'll get in touch with us.
        People generally feel that a cheat is a cheat, a crook is a crook, and
        if they have to pay full value for a phone call they see no reason why
        someone else shouldn't.  There also are professional tipsters who go
        from one company to another offering information for a price.  However,
        we rarely deal with them.

MCI World: Which MCI people, by the nature of their jobs, are most likely to
           detect or at least suspect, fraudulent activity?

Bowens: Our switch technicians have been very instrumental in detecting abuse.
        They're in a position to identify extensive busy signals on circuits,
        abnormal calling patterns, and code use.  They've identified many
        hackers just by reviewing their daily call statistics. Employees in our
        billing department are also good at spotting unusually large bills and
        abnormal patterns.  Though most fraud is detected by the systems we
        have in place, the human eye continues to be extremely helpful.

MCI World: In addition to working with internal people to help detect
           fraudulent activity, you also rely on the expertise of external
           agencies.  Which outside agencies assist you with investigations.

Bowens: When fraudulent activity involves the theft or illicit use of
        authorization codes or credit calling cards, MCI and the Secret Service
        work together to investigate the case.  If other activity is involved,
        such as the use of our service in furtherance of other crime, MCI works
        with the FBI.  When the U.S. Postal Service is manipulated in a fraud
        case, MCI and postal inspectors investigate together.  Additionally,
        Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) often provide hard evidence in cases
        that MCI prosecutes.

MCI World: When you are alerted to suspected fraudulent activity, what steps do
           you take to open and pursue the case?

Bowens: Security investigators contact the customer whose code is being abused,
        advise them of MCI's suspicions, and attempt to confirm them.  If the
        response confirms their suspicion of fraud, they open the case.
        Normally, an investigation entails much research into toll records to
        identify abusers, unusual call patterns and the parties who might be
        involved in illicit activity.  We also interview parties receiving the
        calls and document their statements.  Once we collect sufficient
        evidence, we decide whether a case should be pursued as a criminal or
        civil action.

MCI World: How long does it normally take MCI's investigators to "crack" a
           case?

Bowens: Typically, investigators can crack a case within hours.  Identifying
        fraud suspects is the easy part.  Amassing the evidence--dotting all
        of the legal i's and crossing the t's--is tougher.  Gathering evidence
        may take weeks and large cases involving many parties can take months
        to solve.

MCI World: With fraudulent activity knowing no geographical restrictions, how
           do you segment the problem divisionally?

Bowens: The security investigations department acts primarily in an advisory
        capacity, helping investigators in the divisions with procedural
        matters.  The divisions generally take responsibility for investigating
        fraudulent activity within their jurisdictions and corporate
        investigators pursue cases that are large in scope or require specific
        expertise.  Corporate also takes on cases involving offenders operating
        in more than one division.

MCI World: Can you elaborate on MCI's goals for reducing the level of
           fraudulent activity?

Bowens: We want to reduce fraud to the lowest possible level.  One of MCI's
        goals is to cut fraud by more than half in 1986.  We want to be the
        industry leader in curbing this illegal activity.

Broadway Hacker Turned Fed Informant?                              June 2, 1986
-------------------------------------
Broadway Hacker recently called Phreakers Quest and left feedback to the
sysop of that system (Shawn) saying, "I do believe that some of this
information here is illegal."  Shawn called Dark Creeper and reported this to
him who then later told it to me.

Sometime later, Broadway Hacker called Knight Bandit to voice validate him for
The Radio Station.  He claimed he was some sort of fed and that KB would be
hearing from someone in Bell Security.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Radio Station is down because Broadway Hacker has sold his computer, his
disks, and everything else and is moving to his new job at an unknown
destination.  When I spoke with him, he went on that he sold his user log, but
would not comment on that any further.  He wanted me to print that he was a fed
and that all of his former users would soon be receiving visits from the FBI.
This is exactly what he told Phantom Phreaker and several others which started
a mass riot in the phreak world.  One result was the takedown of Alliance for
fear of its safety.  It since has been put back up.

Broadway justified his actions by saying that by telling rodents he was a fed,
it would keep them off his board.  Later he said that since he is leaving the
phreak world and no one knows where he is going, "To hell with the phreak
world, let it fall apart and die for all I care."  So this fed scare is an
attempt to do just that.  Was it a joke?  Did he mean that really?  I don't
know.  Maybe he did mean it then but now has changed his mind...

No one should be worried about this, everything is ok, and Broadway is not
working with the FBI.  He now claims that he needed his line free for business
calls and all of the above were attempts to get people not to be calling him as
he didn't have the time or patience.  Use your own judgement.

Broadway Hacker still has his Vic 20 and an old modem and is attempting to get
back on boards.  He has also stated that the Radio Station BBS will be put back
up at the end of the summer.  Where it will be run from is unknown although,
Broadway speculated that when it returns it would be run off of an Amiga.

Grown-Up Laws Sought For Computer Criminals
-------------------------------------------
By Dave Skidmore (Associated Press)

WASHINGTON-Teen-age computer hackers are giving way to a new generation of
people who steal information from computers for profit rather than fun, the
head of a House crime panel said Wednesday.

"The hackers were the first generation we saw.  Now we have a lot of
professionals who are getting into the business of accessing computer data
bases," said Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J. [609/645-7957 or 202/225-6572], the
sponsor of legislation aimed at helping law enforcement authorities better cope
with the problem.

Hughes commented as the House subcommittee on crime, which he heads, studied
the proposed Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

Teen-age computer hobbyists, motivated fun and desire for status among fellow
hobbyists, use home computers and the telephone to "hack" into government and
industry data bases.

Now, Hughes said, hackers' techniques are being increasingly used by
industrial spies who sell trade secrets gleaned from corporate computers and
thieves who change bank records to steal millions of dollars.

"Computer crime is probably one of the fastest growing areas of crime. (It's)
going to make the old robbery and burglary a little passe with certain
professionals," he said.

Hughes' bill, cosponsored by Reps. Bill McCollum, R-Fla [202/225-2176], and
Bill Nelson, D-Fla [202/225-3671], creates three new offenses.

1. It forbids unauthorized access to a computer and drops a requirement that
   the government prove information in the computer was used or altered.

2. It outlaws "pirate bulletin boards" used by hackers to trade secret computer
   codes and passwords.

3. It makes it a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000
   fine to maliciously cause damage in excess of $1,000 to a computer program
   or data base.

That section of the bill would apply to so-called "Trojan Horse" programs
which, when achieving access to another computer, destroy all the data and
programs in that computer.

The legislation is intended to plug loopholes in anti-crime legislation
passed by Congress in 1984, Hughes said.  It applies to computers used by the
federal government or its contractors and bank and loan association computers.

Hughes said he expected his bill and similar legislations sponsored by Sen.
Paul S. Trible Jr., R-Va [804/771-2221 or 202/224-4024], to reach the House
and Senate floors sometime in May.

                    Information Provided by Blue Buccaneer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a critical breakdown of the above article.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Buccaneer:

Concerning this law: I always thought it would be more fun to hack for cash,
but hey...  Anyway, the three new offenses are what I am not to fond of:

1) "forbids unauthorized access to a computer" (Gosh, really?)  "and drops a
    requirement that the government prove information in a computer was used or
    altered"  Now what kinda law is that?!  The government can just arrest
    someone and not have to prove anything?  COME ON!

2) "It outlaws 'pirate BBSes'"  When will these people learn the correct
   terminology?  Pirates trade warezzzz, not 'secret passwords and codes'.  The
   point is, that because this is a federal law, it will apply to all states.
   We aren't talking pussy-laws anymore.  Wouldn't it be damn awful if just
   running the stupid BBS was a crime?  Besides that, I thought we had a right
   to freedom of the press.  Again, COME ON!

3) "and a $250,000 fine to maliciously cause damage in excess of $1000 to a
   computer program or data base".  Excuse me for asking, but can one
   "maliciously" destroy data?  And isn't a quarter of a million dollars a bit
   much for a teen-ager on a regular allowance?  And that much for $1000
   damage?  Shit, I wish my insurance company paid like that when I wreck my
   car.  Once again, COME ON!

And then, I guess this is the journalist's fault, but what the hell does that
paragraph on Trojan Horses have to do with this shit?  I mean really!  Do you
think Joe Blow in the street is going to go: "Whew, for a minute there I was
afraid that new bill might just skip over those Trojan Horse things."  I'd
kinda assume Trojan Horses were covered under the "maliciously" destroying
data rule.

Computer Kids, Or Criminals?
----------------------------
Mr. Slippery, age 12, never thought playing on his home computer amounted to
much more than harmless fun -- until a mysterious call from a stranger one day
proved otherwise.  "I got a funny phone call from someone offering me money to
destroy a bank's records," said Slippery, identified by his hacker alias.  "At
that point in time, I realized that that's an incredible way to launder money.
That if I was real smart, I would move out of the whole thing, because that was
an obvious point at organized crime, to me."

Hacking, or using a personal computer to trespass by phone lines into the
private computer systems of corporations, foundations, universities and banks,
is a new form of organized crime, say experts.  In the last year or two, a new,
sophisticated breed of hacker has emerged.  Their ages vary, from the early
hackers who started at 14, and have now entered college, to adults who operate
computerized crime networks, but their motives are similar:  criminal.

When Mr. Slippery started hacking seven years ago he as an exception among
pimply faced, curious kids whose computers were toys for cheap, and typically
harmless, thrills.  For four years, he lived up to his alias, eventually
penetrating top security government computers at the Department of Defense
(DOD) and the National Security Agency (NSA).  Mr. Slippery remained undetected
until his last several weeks as a hacker.  He was never caught, never
convicted.  Toward the end, he realized government security agents were
following him and decided to put away his phone modem for good.

"After about four years of this, though, I started realizing that an entirely
new crowd had sprung up," observes Mr. Slippery, now a 19-year-old ex-hacker.
"You now have the 14 year olds who were running around destroying things seeing
how much trouble they could cause."  Computer crime experts say the hacker
problem is getting worse, even though industries are increasingly reluctant to
discuss the topic.  "The malicious hacker problem is continuing to increase
drastically and is getting far more serious," said Donn B. Parker, author of
Fighting Computer Crime and a computer and data security consultant at SRI
International, a California-based, non-profit research institute.

"The lowering costs of equipment, the attraction of it for new kids coming into
it as a rite of passage, points to increasing vulnerability of American
business to the hacker problem."  Parker's expertise got him hired as a
technical consultant to the movie War Games about two teen-age hackers who
penetrate government defense computers.  Where there is evidence of serious
computer hacker crime is on electronic bulletin board systems (BBSes), where
hackers share gathered intelligence.  "Phone companies have huge investments
in their equipment that is highly vulnerable to the hackers, who have figured
out how to beat them, and have used pirate boards for their intelligence
purposes," said SRI International's Parker.

"A large proportion of these kids are, in fact, juvenile delinquents with other
arrest records."  Recently, a hacker posted this on a local BBS:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
I live in Cleveland and the Pheds are fucking everywhere.  This guy who goes by
the alias Lou Zer got caught and they told him if he narced on like 5 people he
would get off with probation so he did that.  Now like half the 2300 club has
been busted and this kid has a lot of problems in the future.  Also I have seen
cops that I know of dressed as fucking federal express guys.  Try and avoid
using them.  Also, here's some PBXs to fuck with.  They belong to Standard Oil.

                                             --Later, Sir Gallahad
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Other BBSs post lists of telephone numbers of Fortune 1000 corporations, banks,
credit bureaus, universities, and foundations.

Admittedly, many of the numbers are invalid, say experts.  Though there are
BBSes that admit members only by invitation and operate as part of a computer
underground, others can be accessed by anyone with a computer and a phone
modem.  Often the boards carry foreboding names like The Sanctuary, Future
World, Dark Side, Deathtrap and Speed Demon Elite.  Computer crime is sometimes
called the perfect crime.  Its perpetrators are anonymous hackers using aliases
like Phantom Phreaker, Big Brother, Bootleg, Sigmund Fraud, and Scan Man.

John Maxfield is a computer security consultant who lives in a downriver
suburb.  Maxfield spends most of his working hours scanning BBSs, and is known
by computer crime experts as a hacker tracker.  His investigative work scanning
boards has resulted in more prosecutions of computer hackers than anyone else
in the field, say sources familiar with his work.  Maxfield, who accepts death
threats and other scare tactics as part of the job, says the trick is knowing
the enemy.  Next to his monstrous, homemade computer system, Maxfield boasts
the only file on computer hackers that exists.  It contains several thousand
aliases used by hackers, many followed by their real names and home phone
numbers.  All of it is the result of four years of steady hacker-tracking, says
Maxfield. "I've achieved what most hackers would dearly love to achieve," said
Maxfield.  "Hacking the hacker is the ultimate hack."

Maxfield estimates there are currently 50,000 hackers operating in the computer
underground and close to 1,000 underground bulletin boards.  Of these, he
estimates about 200 bulletin boards are "nasty," posting credit card numbers,
phone numbers of Fortune 500 corporations, regional phone companies, banks, and
even authored tutorials on how to make bombs and explosives.  One growing camp
of serious hackers is college students, who typically started hacking at 14 and
are now into drug trafficking, mainly LSD and cocaine, said Maxfield.  This is
an example of a recent BBS posting:

WANTED: LSD, of any kind.  Leave me mail if you're willing to talk prices, I'll
take anything up to $5 a hit.  $3 is more likely.

The BBSs are versatile teaching tools, too.  Hackers post detailed tutorials
on:

HACKING: Using a personal computer and modem to trespass into the private
         computer systems of corporations, foundations, universities, and
         banks.

CARDING: Using valid credit card numbers obtained from discarded carbons,
         accounts posted at video rental stores, or even by hacking credit
         bureau computers.

TRASHING: Sifting through trash to find discarded credit card carbons,
          receipts, computer passwords, code words, confidential phone company
          directories.

PHREAKING or FONING: Manipulating phone systems, usually to make
                     long-distance calls at no charge.

Below is an excerpt from a four-part tutorial on credit card fraud posted on an
exclusive East Coast BBS for elite advanced hackers:

Carding! By Music Major.  Believe it or not, without carding, a damper would be
put on the computer users of America (and especially Canada).  Can you imagine
trying to save enough money to BUY a 2400 baud modem and a 30 meg drive for a
BBS?  Oh, of course it can be done, but considering that a majority of the
active computer users are still in school, and most do not have a steady job,
it will take too long, and cost too much for this average person to spend on a
BBS.  Working at minimum wage at a part-time job, it would take 30 weeks of
CONSTANT saving to put up the BBS (with good modem and good drive).  Not a
pretty thought! When the going gets tough, the tough go carding!

Music Major goes into more detail on later, he warns younger hackers about the
possible risks of trying a method he claims he invented:  "I have called this
method foning for cards.  To be convincing, you MUST have a fluent tongue and a
semi-deep voice (skip this part if your voice is still cracking--refer back
when you get a real voice)."

Maxfield's operation is called BoardScan.  He is paid by major corporations and
institutions to gather and provide them with pertinent intelligence about the
computer underground.  Maxfield also relies on reformed hackers.  Letters of
thanks from VISA and McDonald's decorate a wall in his office along with an
autographed photo of Scottie, the engineer on Star Trek's Starship Enterprise.

Often he contacts potential clients about business.  "More often I call them
and say, I've detected a hacker in your system," said Maxfield.  "At that
point, they're firmly entrenched.  Once the hackers get into your computer,
you're in trouble.  It's analogous to having roaches or mice in the walls of
your house.  They don't make their presence known at first.  But one day you
open the refrigerator door and a handful of roaches drop out."

Prior to tracking hackers, Maxfield worked for 20-odd years in the hardware end
of the business, installing and repairing computers and phone systems.  When
the FBI recruited him a few years back to work undercover as a hacker and phone
phreak, Maxfield concluded fighting hacker crime must be his mission in life.

"So I became the hacker I was always afraid I would become," he said.  Maxfield
believes the hacker problem is growing more serious.  He estimates there were
just 400 to 500 hackers in 1982.  Every two years, he says, the numbers
increase by a factor of 10.  Another worrisome trend to emerge recently is the
presence of adult computer hackers.  Some adults in the computer underground
pose as Fagans, a character from a Charles Dickens novel who ran a crime ring
of young boys, luring young hackers to their underground crime rings.

A few notes:  It is my assumption that Music Major's Carding Tutorial was
from KL       actually four posts made on the Carding Subboard on Stronghold
-------       East.  If this is true then it would mean that at the time or
              previous to the time of this article Maxfield was on SE.  This
              post was probably taken in before the MASSIVE user purge on
              Stronghold East.

Daniel Zigmond: Real Reporter or Freelance FED?                    May 20, 1986
-----------------------------------------------
This article in no way endorses one view over the other, but will try to look
at evidence and facts pertaining to both of the above statements.

Daniel Zigmond;  Wants to write an article on hackers and phreaks, our general
social atmosphere, and our side of the story.  He IS a contributing editor on
the staff of Amiga World Magazine and he has lived at 6735 Forest Glen Road,
Squrill Hill, Penn. and had the phone numbers (412)422-1979/7515 for at least 3
years.  Reportedly he has accounts on ARPAnet, Private Sector, and Byte
Magazine BBS.

He has been on several conferences and been talking to several phreaks across
the nation.  To name a few:  Blue Buccaneer, Cap/N/Crax, Compu-Phreak, Dark
Cavalier, Dead Lord, Final Impulse, Holophax Phreaker, Knight Lightning, Ninja
NYC, Scan Man, Sigmund Fraud, Slave Driver, The Bootleg, The Clashmaster, The
Infiltrator, The Firelord, The Seker, and TUC.

He tapes all his conversations and has tried to get people to call other
phreaks on 3-ways in attempts to gain their phone numbers.  He did however make
some attempts to help Sigmund Fraud after his near bust (see story in this
issue).

There are a few extremely odd things about Mr. Zigmond.

1.  He wants everyone to send him their codes, extenders, PBXs, diverters, etc.
    Even if they no longer work.  When asked why, he answered that he needed
    something to show his boss so he wouldn't be turned down because of what
    would seem to be a b.s. article.

    Why doesn't he just make things up?  After all he said that the stuff
    didn't have to be good.  His reply to that was that his boss might check a
    few.  Well if they were dead codes or PBXs or whatever then he would be up
    the creek anyway.

    Ok, forgetting about that for a moment, Zigmond also asked that people
    photocopy their notebooks and send those copies to him and that he would
    pay the postage and for the photocopies.  This of course means he gets your
    address and at the very least your township and such (that is if you don't
    leave a return address) from the postmark.

2.  He has refused to give out a phone number to reach him at work or at Amiga
    World.  Furthermore, he doesn't plan to have the article in Amiga World,
    but rather, he has stated that it would be sold to the Washington Post.

    Now I talked with people at the Washington Post and they know nothing about
    this.  I spoke with people in several different areas and turned a blank.
    They didn't even know who Zigmond was.

    This leaves 2 possibilities.  He either never really had any intention of
    submitting this article to them or was just sort of running with the mouth
    in search of glory and attention.

3.  A PBX that Sigmund Fraud had found while hacking in a UNIX was given to
    Zigmond.  It had never been used before, with the exception of a single
    conference to test it out, and within a week of giving it to Zigmond it was
    gone.

4.  Another biggie is that Zigmond claims that by the time he submits this
    article in August 1986 (to wherever) that if he gets $900 for it, he would
    break even.  He is saying this from his phone bills and other expenses on
    the article.

    Now only breaking even after all that time, work, and effort seems a bit
    worthless to me, why would he do it?  You know, they say that fed
    informants get paid very well, not that I am suggesting that Zigmond is a
    fed informant.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some other stuff that may be interesting to know is that Zigmond insists that
he will be getting accounts to Metal Shop Private and Stronghold East when
Taran King and Slave Driver have given very strong "no"s.  He goes around
telling this to people.  His phone answering machine gives you less than ten
seconds to leave a message, this is perhaps to prevent hacking, but
nevertheless annoying.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now please everyone take this file in the way it was intended.  This is not
saying that Daniel Zigmond is helping the feds, he may be completely interested
and wanting to learn about our society.  From this I gather that he will learn
that in the phreak community we try to protect each other from getting busted
and that a reporter like him could literally destroy the phreak world if he was
working with the feds and left unquestioned and unchecked.

This article is a warning to all who may contact Zigmond to use your own good
judgement in dealing with him.  I'm sure that once he answers the questions
raised in this article then everything will be alright.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only other thing I wanted to say is that in general reporters have hurt the
phreak/hack world tremendously in the past.  They bring too much attention to
the phreaks and bring us into the public eye.  As a result there has been much
more legislation creating news laws against us.  Some examples are evident in
this very issue of PWN.  Blue Buccaneer points out all sorts of things in
the new hacking laws article.  Remember the new laws about sysops being
responsible for the boards?  Did you see how that was used in the Teltec busts?
It getting incredibly dangerous out there friends, lets try not to make it any
worse.

Defeat Richard Proctor In 4 Easy Steps!                           June 10, 1986
---------------------------------------
Who is this new investigator Atlanta?  What makes him today's newest and
possibly greatest threat to the phreak world?  The following information
concerns an MCI investigator named Richard Proctor, alias; John Proctor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard Proctor, who also introduces himself to others as John Proctor, is one
of the various MCI investigators that now lurk the nation.  He is in charge of
most of MCI's security/investigation divisions, and is in charge of running the
southeast, east coast, and northeast MCI Investigations.  He has also been
involved with phreaks in the midwest and southwest.

I am not sure of the extent of his "jurisdiction," but all users of MCI should
be careful no matter where they are located.  Holophax Phreaker and The
Infiltrator can personally tell you how he runs the MCI Investigations as they
have been under investigation twice to date.  Holophax Phreaker is currently
still under investigation by Proctor and even by his own local Bell Operating
Company (BOC).

The first thing most investigators would do when they find an access code has
been abused is to wait until it has a large bill to act upon it (which may
never happen).  This is because it is unprofitable to the long distance service
to try to find and prosecute a person who has made less than $500.00 worth of
calls (depending on the LD service).

Richard Proctor is a very different case.  As soon as he finds an access code
is being abused, he will take immediate action.  The following is the series of
events which will take place once Proctor discovers an abused account.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In the following steps, "you" are the phreaker in question that was making the
calls (heaven forbid).  The steps listed are for both "you" and the person(s)
receiving the illegally made phone calls.

Step 1:  Proctor will personally call *EVERY* destination number on the account
         and ask for information on who called them on the date(s) the call(s)
         were made.  If it is a bulletin board, he will contact the sysop by
         voice or if there is no voice number available, he will send one or
         more investigators from the nearest MCI Investigations Department to
         question the sysop.  He will ask them for information pertaining to
         the phreaker.  Hopefully, your amnesiac friends will somehow forget
         all about you and be able to tell Proctor nothing.

Step 2:  Proctor waits a couple of days, then he again contacts the person(s)
         that received calls and says that he has found you and that you have
         told him that the people "you" had been speaking with also made those
         calls and that the Proctor will bust the person(s) who were called
         unless they would like to pay for the calls.  (If this part pertains
         to you, that is if you were the one who received calls and Proctor or
         any agent said this then, at this point you should contact an attorney
         as this is telephone harassment, a federal crime committed over an
         interstate communications carrier, and you could sue MCI or whichever
         company it involved).

Step 3:  If some of the person(s) called by you weren't as amnesiac as you
         would have liked when Proctor spoke to them and then Proctor calls you
         or your parents, then you should deny everything that Proctor accuses
         you of, no matter how many people he says turned you in.  Proctor will
         be lying (one hopes) so deny everything.

Step 4:  Proctor will call you again in a couple of days and tell you that you
         have one last chance to turn yourself in.  When you say no again,
         Proctor will try to scare you by telling you that MCI is going to make
         an example of you and prosecute to the fullest extent.  If Proctor
         does this, then you know he has no evidence on you or at most,
         circumstantial evidence.

You might get a couple of calls after that.  Keep denying it and make sure you
drop out of phreaking for approximately 1 1/2 - 2 months. If you get a call
from your local phone company then drop out for at least 6 months to a year.
They will most likely put a pen register or a DNR on your line.

Proctor has PhDs in Psychology and Criminal Psychology so be very careful!  He
can't do anything to you if you follow the above guidelines unless he had a
trace put on the account you were using.  If that is the case, then he will
show up at your door arrest you.  Your best bet is to stay away from it
entirely. Proctor's home phone is unlisted (of course), but his office number
can be obtained from any MCI operator.

                            Information Provided by
                     Holophax Phreaker and The Infiltrator

Quick Notes
-----------
Stronghold East is now running on a new Apple //e thanks to their friends at
AMEX.  They formally ran SE off of a Franklin Ace.              May 3, 1986
Most recently the hard drive at SE crashed and until they acquire the new
ProDos Apple net, they will be running Phlash-Net written by Phlash Gordon.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rumor has it that the Apple Wizard was busted for dealing and using coke.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A guy named the CPTN was busted in Nevada for something pertaining to the
Captain Midnight incident.  He was also busted for carding and was caught with
illegally obtained modems.                                 Info by Death Angel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A member of the Underworld Elite, run by Night Stalker, got busted for calling
the White House and making a bomb threat.  The Secret Service came to his house
and they knew he used illegal extenders to make the calls.  This user decided
to give them the number and his passwords to the Underworld Elite.  He was
deleted.          Info by Night Stalker, 5/11/86...The Underworld (216)356-9464
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Telenet Bob was busted. The full story appeared in the April issue of 2600
Magazine.  Nineteen year old from New Jersey.  Name Robert Davenport.  $500
fine, $890 restitution to AT&T.                Info by Sally Ride:::Space Cadet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad Boy In Black has given up BBSing and Phreaking (for the most part) so you
probably won't be hearing from him again. He claims he has gotten bored of
BBSing and have had little time since the summer is rolling around. Therefore,
he decided to give it up all together.       Info by [bad boy in black] 5/11/86
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shooting Shark has also left the phreak world for the more or less same
reasons plus the fact that he is going to college.      Info by Shooting Shark.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Texas, some cop was running a bbs called the Tunnel.  No one was busted, but
names and handles of those posting illegal codes were collected. The cop has
received several death threats.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Slayer was busted on April 25, 1986.  Reportedly he was visited by agents
from Metrophone, MCI, New Jersey Bell, and the FBI.  His bust concerned Metro
abuse.  The Godfather, in Rhode Island, was also linked to this bust as well
and as of now has quite the phreak world, but no further information is
available on that.  Most recently it has been discovered that the Slayer has
been hired as a TSPS operator.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More news on The Sprinter here; after all was said and done, Sprinter plea
bargained (as expected) and plead guilty to the charges.  He spent 14 days in
jail, has a $2000 fine, 2 years probation, 200 hours community service, and of
course those lawyer costs.  He at this point has not accepted a job with
MicroSoft.                                               Info by Jester Sluggo.

The Arabian Knight was busted for conferencing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Guardian Demon (215) was apparently busted for Metrophone abuse, but formal
charges have not been brought forth.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jester Sluggo has officially retired from all board calling and is now into
straight hacking.  He will maintain his contacts in the phreak world.  Sysops
are asked to remove his accounts.
