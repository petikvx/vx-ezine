Subject: harassment

I have a question ?

  [ I don't know... do you? ]

Is there any way I can find out who is calling if it is from a computer...
I think that is where the annoying calls are being made?

  [ If you are in a country that does not have consumer Caller ID, or
    provider ANI, then just follow the cord attached to the end your
    telephone until you find the person at the other end.  Ask them
    nicely if they called you. ]

    tied a tie around his neck and covered his body with a suite.
    They wrote that he was the CEO (CEO?, #1?) of [the company named]

I am new to the world of hacking and cracking, and I want to get some info
on the above.

  [ Welcome to our world, Jason. ]

What I want to do is, obtain credit card numbers, get email passwords and
get into NASA and the FBI, if I am lucky.  The sort of stuff the movie
"Hackers" illustrated.  I don't know if this can be done, if it can, can
someone email me the information or point me into the right direction on
were to start.

  [ Sounds like some pretty serious stuff you want to get into.  I
    recommend watching Hackers a few more times and then getting yourself
    some Gibsons.  Remember -- the most commonly used passwords are "love",
    "sex", "secret" and "god" -- BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT ORDER YOU

Hey again Phrack

  [ Hello ]

I have now read quite a few of your magazines. BUT there is a pretty
nasty failure in number 56... Either the index file is misplaced or the
articles are. They don't match, that's for sure!

  [ It is all fine.  It is indexed in hex (the index file is quite clear if
    you bother to read it -- p56-0x01) ]

If you have gotten the time for it could you then please fix it. And I
would be happy if you would send me a copy of the correct one when
finished..

  [ No.  It's not broken, chump. ]

Thank you.

Subject: [phrackstaff] Best wishes

Greetings guys (and gals?),

  [ Greetings, I. O. ]

        First things first: Phrack is a really good e-zine, and loopback is
just great, but you knew this already ;)

  [ Of course! ]

I'm an aspiring hacker and all-round geek. Girls are scarce over here;
knowledge even more so. I developed the hacker state of mind when I was
exposed to the Net, while I was studying like a demon for a competition
which landed me my Celeron (with some peripherals). While surfing two
days ago, I stumbled onto phrack.org and an old flame was rekindled; So
here I am...
        Really guys, Phrack is a good thing. Keep up the good work. The
home page is very nice too... Maybe even chicks will dig it ;)

  [ The webmaster has been hoping they would since day 1. ]

        I'm a pretty good C and C++ programmer, and the only difficulty I
have is money. NO credit cards to pay for books I can buy only online. I'd 
be very grateful if anyone over there could give me the location of a
_free_ machine-readable copy of "The C Programming Language" by K&R. I
doubt if even the universities over here have it (off the record, some
professors here don't know that printf(...) actually returns something, but
claim to have written Linux kernel modules :| ).

  [ If you're a pretty good C programmer, why do you need that particular
    book?  Are you lying to us?  Try a library. ]

        Anyway, thanks, and I can say with absolute, nay, non-relative
certainty that the number of Phrack readers has increased by one
non-atomically.

PS: if the only "alvin" you can recall is alvin of the chipmunks, read
up a bit on the works of Sir Arthur C. Clarke.

Subject: [phrackstaff] You have a slight problem on your site.

Hello, to whom it may concern;

When I went to your 'download' link it opened in 'edit' mode..
showing me the total >> Index of /archives>> without the HTML.

  [ Really?  That's disgraceful! ]

Found your site while searching Yahoo on how to play a video file I
downloaded with an .AVI extension with a comment " EG-VCD" after the name
of file, which causes my Windows Media Player to play only the sound ..
without the video.

  [ Interesting. ]

Thus I was looking for a player/codec to solve this problem.

  [ Good luck. ]

Any suggestions are appreciated.

  [ I'm all out of ideas. ]

Your site has been added to my favorites. I truly enjoy your content.
Congratulations.

  [ Thanks. ]

Take care

   [ hmm, yes indeed, interesting. Hmm. What might this be Dr.Watson?
     The moderator's decision is to investigate this posting a little
     bit further. ]

However, I never sent a message to phrackstaff before this one.  So there
seems to be a problem.  I would kindly request that you do NOT post the
