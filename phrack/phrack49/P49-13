Telco's use many types of software.  In addition to the run-of-the-mill
employee applications such as OfficeVisions, PROFS, and the usual trashy
selection of DOS/Win applications, telco's use two types of much more
interesting software:

	. Customer applications
	. Provisioning applications

Customer applications are used by telco personnel to deal with customer
issues, such as billing and service orders.  Provisioning applications are
used to deal with the actual phone network itself.

Customer applications include BOSS, CARS, CORD, SOLAR, SOPAD, OSCAR, and
PREMIS.  Provisioning applications include FACS, March, April, COSMOS,
Switch and FOMS/FUSA.

Most of what has been written regarding telco software covered provisioning
applications.  While much can be done with provisioning applications, you
will soon see the incredible opportunities offered by Customer
Applications.  Within the family of Customer Applications you will find the
ability to locate personal information, look up addresses by telephone
number, and modify customer bills.

Experienced dumpster divers will recognize many of the screens shown in
this article.

BOSS
~~~~
BOSS (Billing and Order Support System) contains bill and credit
information, equipment information, carrier billing information, customer
contact notes and payment history.  BOSS is used in the Central and Eastern
Territories of U.S. West.  To login to BOSS, you must enter your a ID, a
two character alphanumeric office code, and a five character password.
BOSS passwords expire after 30 days and cannot be re-used.

BOSS is operated largely with PF keys:

	PF1  = ENTRY	(Entry Screen)
	PF2  = BILL	(Entity and Summary Bill)
	PF3  = IC	(Itemized Calls)
	PF4  = OCC	(Other Charges and Credits)
	PF5  = CSR	(Customer Service Record)
	PF6  = PREV	(Previous Months Bill)
	PF7  = NEXT	(Next)
	PF8  = Note	(Notations)
	PF9  = ASUM	(Adjustments Summary)
	PF10 = COMPUTE	(Compute)
	PF11 = F/B	(Forward/Back)


PF2 will bring up the Billing Screen, which will show you the contact names
and telephone numbers for the account you are looking at.  The CSBL screen
is completely covered with information, and it is impossible to get
everything out of it without careful study.  There are at least two
versions of BOSS in use, this screen is a mix of the two that I am familiar
with:

CARS
~~~~
CARS (Customer Access and Retrieval System) is used in the Western
Territories of U.S. West.  CARS stores bill and credit information,
equipment information, carrier billing information, customer contact notes
and payment history.  CARS user id's are six characters and normally begin
with a 'B' for business.  CARS passwords (lockwords, in U.S. West parlance)
are from 4 to either characters and must contain at least one alpha and one
numeric character.  CARS passwords expire after 30 days.  You will also be
asked for a Project Code (use 'M'), a Group Code (use 'G') and a Position
#.  The Position # consists of a pair of two character fields.  The first
two characters are the office code and the second two characters identify
the individual employee.  The CARS interface is quite similar to the BOSS
interface.  The function keys for CARS are:

	PF1  = LDD 	(Long Distance Detail)
	PF2  = CSBL 	(Current Status Bill)
	PF3  = BILL 	(Bill Detail)
	PF4  = QTFU 	(Query/Treatment Follow-Up)
	PF5  = CCSR	(Current Customer Service Record)
	PF6  = PREV	(Previous Month's Information)
	PF7  = PADJ	(Payment and Adjustments)
	PF8  = NOTE	(Notations)
	PF9  = ABIL	(Adjustment Bill)
	PF10 = COMPUTE	(Compute)
	PF11 = F/B	(Forward/Back)
	PF12 = BESS	(Billed Entry Status Screen)


PF2 will bring up the CSBL (Current Service Bill) screen, which shows you
the "can be reached" numbers and names for the account you are looking at.

PF5 will bring up the Current Service Record (CSR).  A CARS CSR screen
resembles a BOSS CSR screen:

                `-------------------------------------'

CORD
~~~~
CORD (Customer Order Retrieval and Display) is used in the 206, 503 and 509
NPA's.  CORD has three functions:

        . Accessing service orders by order number
        . Locating order numbers by telephone number
        . Locating order numbers by telephone prefix

Let's say you know that an attractive young lady is moving into your
apartment complex but you don't know her apartment number or her telephone
number.  Connect to CORD and pull up all of the service orders for the
apartment complex's prefix and scan them until you find one in the
apartment complex on or near the date she moved in.  It's much easier if
you have at least a first name.

To use CORD, you will need to know the code for your NPA.  206 is 0, 503 is
5 and 509 is 6.


SOLAR
~~~~~
SOLAR (Service Order Logistics and Reference) is used in Southern 308, 319,
402, 515, 605 and 712.  In addition, SOLAR is used in Northern 218, 507,
612 and 701.  I do not know of an NPA where SOLAR is used exclusively.
SOLAR has two capabilities:

        . Accessing service orders by order number
        . Accessing service orders by telephone number


SOPAD
~~~~~
SOPAD (Service Order Provisioning and Distribution) is used in 208, 303
(TNOland), 307, 406, 505, 602, 719 and 801.  SOPAD has two capabilities:

        . Accessing service orders by order number
        . Accessing service orders by telephone numbers

                `--------------------------------------'

PREMIS
~~~~~~
PREMIS (Premises Information System) is a geographical database designed by
BellCore and used by various telco's across the country.  Using Premis, an
employee can do customer lookups by telephone number (CNA), check for
multiple subscribers at an address (upstairs/downstairs), and view account
status.  PREMIS can be used directly, but it is also used by applications
such as SONAR (Service Order Negotiation and Retrieval).

To do successful PREMIS lookups, you will need to be able to encode your
requests in the proper format.  This is very difficult unless to do this on
a regular basis. To make matters more difficult, "proper format" differs
from area to area, even within the same RBOC! Particularly difficult are
trailer parks, nursing homes, military bases and indian reservations.

The PREMIS input screen looks like this:
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|REQ PREM (a)                                                                 |

        DNV     Denver, Colorado
        IDO     Idaho

If the PREMIS database was able to understand your query and find the
address information, you will see an output screen that looks like this:

OSCAR
~~~~~
OSCAR (Optical Storage COM Application Replacement) is a application for
archival and retrieval of microfiche files used in customer service. OSCAR
will store the data from BOSS or CARS for up to 30 years.  OSCAR is
operated with these PF keys:

        PF1  = Main Menu
        PF2  = Bill
        PF3  = Print Verification Screen (and duplicate bill printing)
        PF6  = Previous Bill
        PF7  = Next Bill
        PF11 = Forward/Backward

The OSCAR Main Menu will look something like this:
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
