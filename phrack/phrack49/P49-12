    The FEDLINE software package is a common Bank client for the Federal
Reserve.  Used by Banks, Credit Unions, and other Financial Institutions,
the amount of funds transferred on a daily basis matches or exceeds the 
daily volume of all other EFT networks.  FEDLINE uses hardware encryption
through a special PC card which operates using the US National Bureau of 
Standards, Data Encryption Standard.  This file is not my attempt to 
demystify its operation, but to provide a categorical list of the codes.
