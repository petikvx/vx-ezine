Chris,

Craig Neidorf gave me these addresses as ways to reach you.  He tells me
that you are currently editing Phrack.  I hope you are well.

Recently the EFF sysadmins, Chris Davis and Helen Rose, informed me that
eff.org was using so much of its T-1 bandwidth that UUNET, who supplies our
IUP connection, was charging us an extra $1,000 per month.  They did some
investigation at my request.  We determined that Phrack traffic alone was
responsible for over 40% of the total bytes transferred from the site over
the past year or so.  This is several gigabytes per month.  All in all, the
CuD archive, which contains Phrack, CuD, and other publications accounts
for 85% of our total traffic.  All of the email to and from EFF, Usenet
traffic, and other FTP (from the EFF archive, the CAF archive, and others)
constitutes about 15%.

EFF isn't going to be able to carry it any more because it is effectively
costing us $1,000 per month.  The fundamental problem is that Phrack is so
popular (at least as a free good) to cause real expense in transmission
costs.  Ultimately the users are going to have to pay the costs because
bandwidth (when measures in gigabytes anyway) isn't free.   The 12K per
year it costs us to carry Phrack is not something which EFF can justify in
its budget.  I'm sure you can understand this.

On July 1, eff.org moves from Cambridge to Washington, DC which is when I
expect we will stop carrying it.  I wanted to raise this issue now to let
you know in advance of this happening.

I have also asked Chris and Helen to talk to Brendan Kehoe, who actually
maintains the archive, to see whether there is anything we can do to help
find another site for Phrack or make any other arrangement which will
result in less loss of service.

[Editor:  Well, all things must come to an end.  Looks like EFF's
          move to Washington is leaving behind lots of bad
          memories, and looking forward to a happy life in the hotbed
          of American politics.  We wish them good luck.  We also
          encourage everyone to join.........CPSR.

          In all fairness, I did ask Mitch more detail about the
          specifics of the cost, and he explained that EFF was paying
          flat rate for a fractional T-1, and whenever they went over
          their allotted bandwidth, they were billed above and beyond
          the flat rate.  Oh well.  Thank GOD for Len Rose.

Greetings Furds:

 Have you ever wanted to impress one of those BBS-babes with your astounding
knowledge of board tricks?  Well *NOW* you can!  Be the life of the party!
Gain and influence friends!  Irritate SysOps!  Attain the worship and
admiration of your online pals.  Searchlight BBS systems (like many other
software packages) have internal strings to display user information in
messages/posts and the like.  They are as follows (tested on Searchlight BBS
System v2.25D):

        \%A  =  displays user's access level
        \%B  =  displays baud rate connected at
        \%C  =  unknown
        \%F  =  unknown
        \%G  =  displays graphics status
        \%K  =  displays user's first name
        \%L  =  displays system time
        \%M  =  displays user's time left on system
        \%N  =  displays user's name in format: First Last
        \%O  =  times left to call "today"
        \%P  =  unknown
        \%S  =  displays line/node number and BBS name
        \%T  =  displays user's time limit
        \%U  =  displays user's name in format: FIRST_LAST

All you gotta do is slam the string somewhere in the middle of a post or
something and the value will be inserted for the reader to see.

 Example:  Hey there chump, I mean \%K, you better you better UL or log
           off of \%S...you leach too damn many files..you got \%M mins
           left to upload some new porn GIFs or face bodily harm and
           mutilation!.

[Editor:  Ya know, once a LONG LONG time ago, I got on a BBS and
          while reading messages noticed that a large amount of
          messages seemed to be directed at ME!!#  It took me
          about 10 minutes to figure it out, but BOY WAS I MAD!

          Then I added my own \%U message for the next hapless fool.
          :)  BIG FUN!]

[Editor:  This is an example of what NOT to send to Phrack.
          This is probably the worst piece of garbage I've
          received, so I had to print it.  I can only hope
          that it's a private joke that I just don't get.

          Uh, please don't try to write something worse and
          submit it hoping to have it singled out as the
          next "worst," since I'll just ignore it.]

****************************************************************************

Dear Phrack,
   I was looking through Phrack 42 and noticed the letters about password
stealers. It just so happened that the same day I had gotten extremely
busted for a program which was infinitely more indetectible. Such is life.
I got off pretty well being an innocent looking female so it's no biggie.
Anyway, I deleted the program the same day because all I could think was
"Shit, I'm fucked". I rewrote a new and improved version, and decided to
submit it. The basic advantages of this decoy are that a) there is no
login failure before the user enters his or her account, and b) the
program defines the show users command for the user so that when they
do show users, the fact that they are running out of another account
doesn't register on their screen.
   There are a couple holes in this program that you should probably be
aware of. Neither of these can kick the user back into the account that
the program is running from, so that's no problem, but the program can
still be detected. (So basically, don't run it out of your own account...
except for maybe once...to get a new account to run it out of) First, once
the user has logged into their account (out of your program of course) hitting
control_y twice in a row will cause the terminal to inquire if they are
doing this to terminate the session on the remote node. Oops. It's really no
problem though, because most users wouldn't even know what this meant. The
other problem is that, if the user for some strange reason redefines show:

$show == ""

then the show users screen will no longer eliminate the fact that the account
is set host out of another. That's not a big deal either, however, because
not many people would sit around randomly deciding to redefine show.
   The reason I was caught was that I (not even knowing the word "hacker"
until about a month ago) was dumb enough to let all my friends know about the
program and how it worked. The word got spread to redefine show, and that's
what happened. The decoy was caught and traced to me. Enough BS...here's the
program. Sorry...no UNIX...just VMS.

!!!! it before it is written to the screen for viewing by the user. There  !!!!
!!!! may exist many forms of the show users command in your system, and    !!!!
!!!! you may have to handle each one differently. I have written only two  !!!!
!!!! manipulations into this code to be used as an example. But looking    !!!!
!!!! at how this is preformed should be enough to allow you to write your  !!!!
!!!! own special cases. Notice that what happens to activate this section  !!!!
!!!! of the program is the computer detects the word "show" and interprets !!!!
!!!! it as a procedure call. The words following show become variables     !!!!
!!!! passed into the program as p1, p2, etc. in the order which they       !!!!

          Phrack.  By the way, "innocent female" is an oxymoron.]

 wasting time for his reading ( ex. my playboy time ). But  here  for
 some unknown reason appear equal  style,  and  all  loopback  remind
 something medium between "relations search" [Hello Dear Phrack, I am
 security expert of our local area, but when I looked  to  output  of
 "last" program (oh,yeah - "last" it is ...), I ocassionaly  under  -
 standed  what apparently someone elite  hacker  penetrated  into  my
 unpassworded  account!  But  how  he  knew  it???  I  need  to  talk
 with him! Please mail me at security@...] and "make yourself" [Yep.I
 totally wrote program which gets file listing from target  vicitim's
 home directory in current host. After that I decided  to  contribute
 it for You. I hope this will help. Here is the complete C code. "rx"
 permission in target's '$HOME' required.].
  Looking similar articles like "... off Geek!" and  various  reports
 which don't reacheds PWN. [CENSORED BY ME].
  Resulting from abovewritten reason and I let  myself  to  add  some
 elite (oops word too complex), some bogus and little deposit to Your
 lb. He written in classic plagiarize style.

          allowing us to use ftp.netsys.com as our new official FTP

          set of huevos to let such an evil hacker publication
          reside on your hard drive after serving time for having
          dealings with evil hackers.  We are STOKED!  Thanks Len!
          Netsys is not your average site, INDEED!]

Something Phrack might like to see:

The contributors to and practices of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
disclose quite accurately, just who this organization represents.  We
challenge the legitimacy of the claim that this is a "public interest"
advocate.  Here is a copy of their list of contributors:

[FINS requested the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts to provide us with a list of contributors of over $5000, to
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, required by IRS Form 990.  Timothy E.
Dowd, of the Division of Public Charities, provided us with a list (dated
January 21, 1993), containing the following information.  No response was

[Editor:  Well, hmmm.  Tell you guys what:  Send Phrack that
          much money and we will give up our ideals and move to
          a new location, and forget everything about what we
          were all about in the beginning.  In fact, we will turn
