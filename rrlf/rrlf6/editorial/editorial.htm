<u><b>Intro</b></u>
Happy birthday RRLF!  Yes, today, at the release  date 21.07.2005,  it's the
5. birthday of the ready rangers liberation front. And as present for us and
for you we bring  you the sixth issue of  our  electronic magazine.  We, the
members and contributers,  working hard to bring you such good content,  the
BEST EVER! Many people say that the RRLF is just a script kiddie crew, can't
even touch other things then  batch and  scripts.  Here we  are,  with  very
good content. I hope people now get another idea what RRLF is about.  And if
not, i will ask that persons: what do you do for the VX scene?! Future of v.
writing is dark,  but no question,  we keep on coding and bring you e-zines.
And we are very pleased when you, as coder, do the same  and  contribute  to
our or other groups e-zines. Now enogh with the boring intro, open your beer
and enjoy the RRLF zine issue six! <b>Salute...</b>
