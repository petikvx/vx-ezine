<pre><p>hi folks!
today, i´m introducing you into the world of cheap lower low cost mixtures,
which we need for our brains to work. ;) if you´re thinking i´m silly, do so. that bores all.  
serious part: 

conditions: you need to have a party, hope there're some mafuckas who you spit at
            so it´s funnier for you to steal some whiskey. drugs are necessary.
            further you should have a bottle of jack daniels, cola and orangejuice...


ok, mix that shit as following:

1/5 of the stolen bottle jackie
2/5 cola
2/5 from the orangejuice


enjoy your unexpensive drink...


another tip:
take 1L becks, and 2G weed. mix it. wait about five minutes. drink it with friends
