<p><b><u>Strange Article - How To Hack a Cisco Router by Conwow</u></b>
<p>In this text I aim to explain methods used to hack Cisco routers and why you
<br>may want to do this, this is not for criminals wanting to break the law
<br>rather people who are interested in securing their computer and interested
<br>in how computers and networks are hacked. This will not cover techniques
<br>used to hack other routers as they work on different basic principles and
<br>are basically just different. I also will not and cannot explain what a
<br>router is used for and why they are used, these things you have to find out
<br>for your self. The following texts should be helpful.
<br>&nbsp;Routers are used to receive packets across the internet, they are a form of
<br>modem. They are really just another gateway between the user and the
<br>internet, If you want to find out more about routers and their job I would
<br>advice you read www.homenethelp.com/web/explain/
<br>about-broadband-routers.asp, www.homenethelp.com/router-guide/index.asp or
<br>http://www.redherring.com/mag/issue102/800020080.html. These are all very
<br>good basic introductions to routers and their job.
<br>&nbsp;Routers shouldn't be thought of as another piece of hardware in the
<br>computer, rather another computer between you and the internet. They don't
<br>have keyboards or display using like a screen etc. But they still have to be
<br>configured, so how is this done, well the answer is simple telnet. You
<br>telnet to the router, login and then you are away. You can then configure it
<br>remotely using telnet. So I assume you have a IP address for your Cisco
<br>router, now we can telnet to it. We do this in Linux by typing telnet then
<br>open then a prompt will come up saying TO here we type the IP address. In
<br>Windows we need to click START > RUN then type telnet IPADDRESS. Then we
<br>will have connected to the router.
<br>&nbsp;Now if this fails you have one of two options, first is to see if it is up
<br>and running we do this using the ping command (ping PADDIES), in MS-DOS.
<br>When you do finally connect your telnet client will display something like
<br>this.
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>USER ACCESS VERIFICATION
<br>Password:
<br>-----------------------------------
<p>&nbsp;At this point we are required to enter a password, no username is needed
<br>because hey this is a router, these are simple. Now we need to learn a
<br>little about Cisco routers and their password authentication. A router has
<br>two types of passwords, the enable password or the privileged account and
<br>the exec account or non privileged user account. Now the privileged account
<br>is like the root account on Linux, it is where you can configure things, and
<br>break things. The exec password is for normal day to day use and we don't
<br>want to bother with that.
<p>Default Passwords
<p>By default the privileged account password will be "enable" so if we have a
<br>dumb/lazy/forgetful system administrator then they won't have changed this
<br>password. So lets try it type enable at the login prompt. If you get
<br>Authentication Failed then hey shit happens, but if you get a prompt looking
<br>something like this
<br>CBOS#
<br>Then you have rooted the router and you can move onto section two. If not
<br>read on, we will try some other methods of breaking into a router.
<p>Buffer Overflow
<p>A buffer is a small section of memory reserved for a variable in a program.
<br>Now the login is a very simple program. If we can fill this small amount of
<br>memory then the program will get confused and begin to play up, and
<br>hopefully crash. We want this router to crash because when it does it
<br>reverts back to the default privileged user account (enable) and we can
<br>login using this when it reboots. So lets try and fill up that buffer using
<br>a huge huge password such as
<br>)(%£&!)(&%)(£!&%)(!£&%(*£!)%)£"&%) (Ten times longer)
<br>If this doesn't work, no worries try it again a few times then if it doesn't
<br>crash move onto ICMP Flooding. If it does move onto "What to do when the
<br>router crashes".
<p>Ping Flooding.
<p>This is a common technique used by hackers lamers and anyone in-between, it
<br>uses the ICMP which is a protocol that was developed for system
<br>administrators to check whether servers where up and do a variety of other
<br>useful jobs. One of the jobs ICMP does though is ping, you can send a ping,
<br>this packet of information will travel to the host and tell the host to send
<br>a ping back. The host will do this, but if you send more pings than the host
<br>can respond to it starts to do stupid things, like crash. Which is what we
<br>want.
<br>&nbsp;If you want to ping flood the router open a MS-DOS box (START > RUN type
<br>command or cmd) and then ping -t -l 120 -w 100 IPADDRESSHERE. This will send
<br>a packet 120 bytes big every 120 miller seconds until you tell the computer
<br>to stop. If the router stops responding after a bit you have crashed it. If
<br>it doesn't play around with the values until it does. If it doesn't full
<br>stop go onto other ideas section.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>What to do when the router crashes
<p>If it crashes it will reboot, and the memory will be wiped, because it uses
<br>non-volatile memory. This means you will be able to login using the default
<br>privileged user password, which is enable. So when it crashes wait 2 minutes
<br>ping it to see if its online (ping it only 1-5 times) if it is try to login
<br>quickly using the enable password.
<p>SECTION TWO
<p>Configuring the Router
<p>If you are logged in the router you will be able to see a prompt looking
<br>something like this
<br>CBOS#
<br>The CBOS stands for Cisco Broadband Operating System the final # shows you
<br>are logged in as enable, it uses Non Volatile Memory which means you have to
<br>input everything into the memory first then tell it to write it their for
<br>ever.
<p>Seeing what is stored in the Memory
<p>This is very simple all you need to do is type
<br>SHOW NVRAM
<br>You will then get a list of everything stored in the memory, you can then
<br>fuck with this how ever you like.
<p>Changing Router Password
<p>The command to set password is
<br>SET PASSWORD "USERTYPE" "PASSWORD"
<br>The things in brackets are the variables, the USERTYPE can either be enable
<br>if you want to set the root password or exec if you want to set the standard
<br>user password. The "PASSWORD" stands for the actual password you want for
<br>example if you wanted to use rabbit you would type that their. Finally you
<br>must save all this to the memory, this is done with a simple command, the
<br>WRITE command. Then I would advise you use the SHOW NVRAM command to ensure
<br>this has been inputed into the memory.
