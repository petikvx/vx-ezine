  Projectname:   	Evolution
  Virusname:     	IRC-Xevol, W32/Xevol
  Version:   	        A
  Type:	    	        I-Worm/IRC-Worm (detected as an Trojan)
  Author:		Xevion


  Description:

  Usually I don't code in script languages, but for this virus
  I made an exception. When I saw what was already done in the
  mIRC script language, and what still can be done in it I felt
  the need to code this virus, to let the people know that there
  can be so much more done in it.

  Most of the mIRC viruses that exist today are lame, I'm sorry
  to offend the people who created them but it is true and it
  must been said.
  If you look at the mirc.hlp file for just 5 minutes you can
  create the viruses that are existing today.
  Most of them are looking a lot like this,

  '========================================
  [script]
  ON *:JOIN:#:{ /dcc -c send $nick %virus }
  ON *:TEXT:*:virus:{ /ignore $nick }
  ON *:TEXT:*:infected:{ /ignore $nick }
  '========================================

  If you code it like this way, the virus depends too much on the victim,
  like to what server he is connecting, what channel he is joining
  and the people it is talking to. Also the victim can be noticed by
  other users that he is infected.
  The virus that I created will be totally independent from the victim.

  This virus will change the view on mIRC viruses and let people see
  what really can be done in the mIRC script language.
  I don't say this virus is perfect, in the conterary. It's only
  the beginning of a new era in mIRC viruses.


  Methods used:

  - Can choose a random folder on the victim's rootdrive to install the virus.
  - The virus can "travel" through the victim's sytem. After each reboot the
    virus will delete the regiserty key from the register that was needed to
    start the virus. After that it will choose a new location, copy all files to
    the new location and create a new registery key for it.
  - Downloads an uptodate serverlist and collects all servers from it.
  - Searches .htm and .html files for IRC servers.
  - Registers mIRC if it not already is, so that that annoying pop-up window dissapears.
  - Generates random filenames for all the files. Only the mIRC executable and
    the mirc.ini file are static.
  - Searches for channels with more then 50 ppl on it, makes a list from them
    and joins randomly 10 channels from the ones that were collected.
  - Searches for channels with the word "help" or "mirc" in it, joins all of
    them and floods them.
  - Scans every user that enters and leaves a channel for the mIRC client,
    if the user uses mIRC the user will become a target.
  - Can hold a small conversation with the target, with a few topics to talk about.
  - Can send itself as a .rar archive with 30 random extensions, as a .zip archive,
    and as an .cmd file. The .cmd files are not yet blocked in mIRC, but they
    will only operate on the Windows NT/2000/XP families.
  - As a payload the virus will sound a random line from a poem everytime
    somebody says the word "help" in an channel.
