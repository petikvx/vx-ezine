<p> The one question that seems to unleash the most dangerous answer is:  "Who rules you?"
<br>Most people, when asked this question, although they may not admit it, realize their submission.
<br>Most people don't base their actions on what pleases them, but what pleases society's eye.
<br>When is the last time you saw somebody that was rich buy some clothes from GoodWill because they were more comfy?
<br>Chances are, you've never seen it.  
<br> Fashion is largely responsible for conforming millions of people into doing something they really don't want to do. 
<br>I mean, who really likes Tommy enough to pay $50 for a wifebeater or some socks and not really feel like an asshole.
<br>A truly smart person would steal the clothes. This doesn't happen because of one thing.
<br>Tommy and other bullshit is bought not for it's appearance, but for what it stands for.
<br>That, simply put, is the money it takes to purchase it.
<br>People spend all their money just to prove that they have money!  The same goes for cars, houses, jewelry, etc.
<br>Who actually loves to hear the crushing and booming noise of bass coming from someone's system?
<br>So, you must ask yourself this one question:  Who rules you?  Make your decisions for you and no one else.

<p><u>The Limited starring Ted and Ed</u>
<p>Ed: Hello Ted.
<p>Ted: Bonjour, Ed.
<p>Ed: I love my house and bed.
<p>Ted: Well, I love astronomy. My favorite planet is Mercury, third from our beloved sun.
<p>Ed: Yes, the sun provides light so others can view my wristwatch. Mercury is not third though, it is second.
<p>Ted: Second?  My friend, you are definitely full of the most rancid kind of shit!
<p>Ed: You say that about myself? I was just watching a special of the planets on television.
<p>Ted: Your program was obviously full of falsehoods. Everyone knows that Mercury is third from the sun.
<p>Ed: Fuck off with your thirdness. If Mercury was the third planet from the sun, we would make use of it's resources.
<br>It is second, 2, the same number of sexually explicit videos your mother has made with the neighbors collection
<br>of caged beings.
<p>Ted: If you disrespect my mother again, you are going to catch multiple dirty stringes forcefully entering you colon.
<br>Shut the fuck up!
<p>Ed: It is ironic that your ignorance of our solar system is the cause of your tantrum.
<p>Ted: It is third, not second!
<p>Ed: It is second and you are a fucking moron. This reminds me of the time you shit yourself in third grade
<br>because you drank too much apple juice. How could someone who can't control their own output know anything
<br>about the universe?
<p>Ted: Oh, you want to dig into a motherfucker's past?!? What about that time you showed that police officer your
<br>erection? He would have had you dropping the soap in no time if it wasn't for you grandma!
<p>Ed: You are dead. I am going to kill you!
<br>(at the sounds of "kill" and "you", Ted pulls out a gun and busts three bullets into Ed's skull) Thump!
<p>Ted: Motherfucker. Third it is! I am bigger than Gawd!  What the fuck do you have to say about that?
<br>Fuck Candace Jordan, and fuck far right board members! I'm on a verbal assault. Mercury is third from the sun.
<br>(Ted urinates on Ed's dead body)
<p> The End
<p><u>Who Controls Your Dreams? (Flight of a Slave)</u>
<p> Fuck this.  I'm going off.  I have this job, you know. It is my occupation. I fucking hate it:
<br>the job itself, my boss, all of it.  I could stay above the deep end if it was not for one thing.
<br>My job robs me already of my dignity and time with family, but there is one thing I just can't take; 
<br>The taking of my dreams goddamnit!  My dreamworld is so uninhibited. So much more opportunities
<br>and possibilities there. Why can't I have that?  Why can't they let us have our natural sleep?
<br>It is about our dreams, they fucking know. It would be to our advantage to receive our full dream.
<br>The job can get done at any time. Why not later? Mother fuck them. The dreamworld is a very important place.
<br>I'm abolishing the clock. I don't need a buzzer.
<br> -Just because it is, does not mean it is right. -Jonnie
<p>Did you know there are actually only 10 years left of mass oil production?  Some may say "Who cares?"
<br>but it's a big deal. This means after the next decade is over oil prices will rise to astronomical prices.
<br>But oil companies won't admit it. They say it's more like fifty years. The question is
<br>"Why the fuck would they lie?" It's simple. Money! By inflating oil reserve estimates,
<br>companies can often raise their stock prices. But there's an issue far more important than that.
<br> Motivation for other types of alternative energy to be developed is hindered.  That means solar, wind,
<br>and hydroelectric won't be developed as soon.  You can see how much we rely on oil.
<br>What will we do when the prices rise drastically and there's not another major source of energy?
<br>Also, what will other countries do to get ahold of this precious commodity? Most likely it will
<br>involve the military. Countries will fight each other for it and the whole world will go into an
<br>economic depression.  With the US being the major oil consumer, it will have the most military
<br>interest in the middle east.  This might prove to our advantage with the US tied up.
<br>It may just give us the opening we need.

<p><u>No Sex, Just Death</u>
<p> "Please review the student handbook on what attire is deemed inappropriate."  Summer is cumming.
<br>The heat is increasing. It is that time of year where the authorities of school's send students
<br>home for showing too much body. The human body is the most disgusting of creations, especially
<br>the parts labeled private. The body should be covered.
<br> Suppression of wet panties and hard cocks should be questioned.  Are the authorities scared of their
<br>won sexual arousal, or fear others?  Most are well aware that sex creates life. You need bodies for sex.
<br>IS it a religious agenda? God creates life, not vile animal trash. Arousal brings forth thought of creation and art.
<br>Perhaps the school authorities feel this is not what students should be doing...
<br> ...but they seem to be okay with bloody death.  Even though it is a natural phenomenon, we have been taught to
<br>fear death since birth. Odd it is that (at Mansfield Senior) we can have posters of corpses chillin' at a morgue
<br>hanging all over the fucking building, but the showing of body is strictly forbidden. Many Richland County
<br>students got to witness mock death at the fairgrounds. This is okay. Watching the loss of life is okay. 
<br>Vaginas, dicks, breasts, legs, and thighs are bad.  You are bad, evil! They fear our sexuality.
<br>They let us watch a gory spectacle at the fairgrounds to "scare us" into not mistakingly drinking and driving and...
<br>die. WE HAVE PICTURES OF CORPSES HANGING ALL OVER THE SCHOOL. No sexuality is no life.
<br>WE HAVE PICTURES OF A CORPSE HANGING ALL OVER THE SCHOOL. Of course, we can't see the private parts, just death.
<br>Life and death. Can't really have one without the other. Try to tell your principal that.
<br>Just what the fuck are they afraid of?
<p> Who Wants To Make Fun of a Millionaire?
<br>I do! They have small dicks! Ump...nevermind.
<p>Question 1: How many zeros does 1,000,000 have?
a) 1 b) 10 c) 6 d) I can't count
<p>The answer is "e"! Welp, I'd better lifeline to my dad to make sure. Hello, dad?  Can you hear me?
<br>No, I didn't fuck a chicken. Okay, the answer is "c" for chicken.
<p>Ding, Ding, Ding! You got the right answer. But, ha ha, you were supposed to guess the wrong answer.
<br>Johnny, bring the man out his prize. It's a hacksaw to cut off your right testicle.
<p>Question 2: You are a fucking idiot!
a) true b) true c) true d) true
<p>Oh my god! I don't know the answer. I'm gong to have to use the 50/50. OK, now only a and c are left, Regis.
<br>I'm going to have to go with b.
<p>Is that your final answer? If it isn't we'll give you a million ways to be told the answer, you fucking idiot!
<p>So much pressure, what should I do? I'm going to poll the audience.  OK, the results were:
<p>a) 5% b) 7% c) 3% d) 2% e) 85% says uhhhh!
<p>Well, I guess I'm going to have to go with "e".
<p>Wow, you really are a fucking idiot! But don't worry, you haven't even given us 5 mins airtime.
<br>We are here to make people at home feel smart. Fuck Jeopardy, that shit is for smart people and they don't even
<br>get that much money. We pay people more to be dumb. Ha!
<p>Since you're so fucking stupid, we'll let you think while we go to our five minutes of capitalist money-making.
<br>[During the break] Damn man, I'm glad you didn't know the answer. I can't believe that I, Regis Philbin,
<br>don't know it either. But it's okay I'm a fucking idiot, I'm making my money.
<p>Hey, you think you could give me Kathie Lee's #'s?
<br>I have some illegal immigrants in my garage that could be of use to her.
<P>Don't call her, that bitch can suck my dick!
<p>Thanks for returning to our show. We have our fucking idiot, Bill Nitwit, on his second question.
<br>Mr. Nitwit, please tell us what you do for a living.
<p>Well, my job isn't anything too serious. I sit in a building all day with 99 other people.
<br>All I have to say is "Aye" or "Nye" whenever they call my name. I've been doing it for so long,
<br>I don't even have to think to do my job. It's kind of involuntary. Then, sometimes, when something goes wrong,
<br>I tell everybody that nothing is wrong. It's an easy job.
<p>So what exactly are you?
<p>Oh, I'm a Senator.
<p>Really, that's interesting. (Regis falls asleep)
<p>Alright, I'm going to say my answer is c. That is my final answer.
<p>Oh, I'm sorry you guessed correctly. Johnny, throw him in the lions den. Thanks for playing Mr. Secretary,
<br>or whatever you are. I'd like to thank MR. Benjamin for inventing the $100 bill. Thanks everybody.
<p> (The Curtains close and the audience is incinerated.)
<br> The End
<br>- By Fellow Felon and Goliath
<p><u>The 1st Lie of the Constitution</u>
<p> The first amendment is bullshit. It states that we have the freedom of speech, religion, press,
<br>assembly, and petition. If that amendment was really in effect, it would be a free country.
<br>You may practice what religion you want, but are looked down upon. That shouldn't be. If you think about it, 
<br>Christianity is forced upon us. There are always advertisements for Christian churches, but why not any other.
<br>Maybe it's because the government doesn't want them to. By being a good Christian, it makes you obey the laws.
<br>It's just a way of conforming to the will of others.
<br> People cannot assemble peacefully without being fucked with by pigs. If it is against the interest of
<br>the government, i.e. money or control, it is broken up.  Most rallies don't become riots until cops get involved.
<br> If reporters and journalists reported what's really going on in the news, things would be different.
<br>Some stories are censored, which are usually about corporate and government flaws, while those about death aren't.
<br>How can people blame fictitious games and movies on violence when the nightly news just as bad. 
<br>While school shootings have always gone on, it's only recently they've been given attention. 
<br>Most probably don't realize the crime rate has been down for years.
<br>Yet the media makes it sound like it's been going up.
<br> The freedom of speech is the most affected. It's hard to say anything without getting in trouble for it.
<br>Take school for instance. Cuss words are restricted even though they're just words. Words can't affect your education.
<br>"If you're saying something offensive, you have to be careful who you're around." Why?
<br>Why should words bother anyone that much. I also don't understand why music is censored.
<br>That you have a choice to listen to it or not. If the artist wanted it censored, they would have done it themselves.
<br>One thing you should never be told to do is SHUTUP!
<br>If someone tries to quiet you for voicing your opinion, speak louder.
<br> -Goliath
<p> Religion is such bullshit. When I think about the lives led by "devout" christians and elite members
<br>of other religious groups, it makes me laugh.  What the fuck?  Next time I have enough free time
<br>to contemplate my relationship with "God", I think I'll wack off instead. At least that's fun.
<br> When I think back a few centuries, I can understand how people might have used Gods to explain
<br>what to them was unexplainable. Things like natural disasters, the weather, the sun, the moon,
<br>the meaning of human existence, and a million other things they couldn't explain. As much as we have
<br>not grown as a society, at least our grasp of the physical world around us has improved.
<br>We now know the Earth revolves around the sun, and the moon around the earth. Big fucking deal,
<br>but it does show one thing. If all of our (and when I say our, I mean their ) former beliefs look stupid now,
<br>imagine how dumb we will look to people a thousand years from now. They'll say things like,
<br>"I can't believe they thought God made people out of sand and water!! How dumb!"
<br>And then, a thousand years from their time, people (assuming the human race is still in existence)
<br>will look back on their beliefs with the same stupid laugh. What we learn from this is simply
<br>the backbone of a weak mind, someone who cannot think for themselves. Most intelligent people you will
<br>find do not believe in God, or at least questioned his existence
<br>(unlike those who blindly accept what they are told).
<br> Although I am not a communist, I have to quote Karl Marx.  He once said that religion is the opiate of the masses.
This is entirely true. If you look at society today, everything encompasses religious beliefs,
<br>and it keeps people sedated. God-fearing people refrain from committing crimes because they believe that
<br>they are morally wrong, and that they will be punished in the afterlife for any mistakes they make in this world.
<br>Our country's pledge of allegiance contains the words "Under God." Our legal system requires witnesses to swear
<br>with their hand upon a Bible to tell the truth. This oath is a threatening hand that promises the fires of hell
<br>to those who lie. As much as we criticize our puritan ancestors for their strict and outrageous beliefs,
<br>those beliefs form the backbone of our government today.
<br> What would happen if an Atheist or an Agnostic ran for president? He or she (if our country wasn't so sexist that 
<br>we would ever actually elect a woman as president) would certainly be defeated.
<br>Part of this reason is the contempt most Christians hold for non-Christians. They believe we do not share the same
<br>"morals" or "values" that they hold so fucking near and dear. This country would never elect someone
<br>they thought didn't have strict moral beliefs and a strong Christian background. Look what Clinton did,
<br>and he's a Christian. If Christians can do things that bad, what would non-Christians sink to in office.
<br>At least, that's what they think.
<br> When you think about it, Christians are behind the decline of society. Wars are fought because people
<br>believe that they are "serving God" and their country. Europeans who destroyed the native Americans
<br>during the colonization of the States believed that they had the God-given right to spread their
<br>pathetic lives across the globe. It was German Christians that attempted to destroy the Jews in Nazi Germany.
<br>Fascists in Italy were convinced that their violent actions were in service to God.
<br>What all these people didn't think to do was to look around, and try to find their God. Do you see him,
<br>cause I sure as fuck don't. People see the beautiful things in life as the product of God,
<br>but the horrible things are the work of the devil. That's great.
<br>Go ahead and believe it if it helps you sleep at night, or if you need a fucking scapegoat for your actions.
<br>But as for me, I'll take responsibility for what I do, good or bad.
<br>No God, no ruler, I control my own life, and no one else does unless they take it from me.
