<p><b><u>Interview with rastafarie by dr.g0nZo</u></b>
<p>The original interview is in German, and can be viewed here:
<br><a href="112.html">Interview mit rastafarie von dr.g0nZo</a>
<br>The following is a more or less good translation:
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>Hi rastafarie! How are you?
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Hi. Yes, quite well. Looking forward to the interview!
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>As we know, you want to leave the rRlf, why?
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Was a great time, but I feel myself a bit wrong-placed with my activity at the Libaration Front.
<br>I ran out of ideas over the last time, so I got to the decission, to leave.
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>Sounds really serious, have you been thinking for long about that?
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Err... yes, since I am stuck in this creative hole. About 1/2 year already.
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>Wohh, your pictures are quite well, nearly got an intoxication on longer looking at them.
<br>What have you been doing besides the pictures?
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Well, my activity was a quite interesting one, I had numerous projects running.
<br>Besides other things, getting myself a Laetitia Casta jpg-collection, and I got to a respectable,
<br>Casta collection of high quality of a size of about 1235 files.
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>Another thing using the FLAT for. Another topic-field. Are you experienced in the drug-sport (intoxication ;) ?
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Well ... You get some experience over the time...
<br>I made some of my pictures for the rRlf in an absolute intoxication...
<br>Have collected quite a lot of ideas while intoxicated, and made some real with my PC.
<br>This was already before my rR time. And about 4 years ago it started together with TeAgeCe...
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>He was also once with us...
<br>Will you accompany philet0ast3r to Amsterdam in August, to the vx meeting? As a "walk in the desert".
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Well I guess it would be some huge fun. But I will use this time in an other way, improving my bong-skills.
<br>This will be one more time in Poland, where a "little" drug-scene has established around TeAgeCe (scratch) and me.
<br>Big potato fields, big intoxication, some huge fun...
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>Any crazy intoxication-stories? How did you get to your dreads? Did friends work on your head?
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Hehe ... Well, after thinking for some longer time, surely about 23000 stories would come to my mind,
<br>but my mind doesn't allow it myself to answer spontanously ... [intoxication] :)
<br>The thing with the dreads ... 3 years ago I decided to let my hair grow long.
<br>To that time I had about 3-4 mm. Well, as I had a lionmane, I started not to wash my hair anymore,
<br>and decided to grow a biotope on my skull, and to dung it with silica.
<br>Yes, and for about a 3/4 year, I got those things on my head now.
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>Are you political active? What do you think of fuckin Schröder's hair-tinting? *ggg* (it gets really gay now)
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Well, firstly to get to our stylic chancellor...
<br>I think gay hydrogenblond would also look good on our Gerhard...
<br>The whole debate in the media, the process against the DPA, I think is ridiculous...
<br>Has nothing better to do, than practising unrestricted loyality for the color of his hair...
<br>Actually I am not really political active, but I am looking foreward to 22.-23.5. ... when maestro W. Bush is in Berlin...
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>Yes yes, the Bush Schorre ... Sadly I can't come along.
<br>What are you doing on the weekend, or on free days, where are you going to (bars, discos, ...)?
<p>rastafarie:
<br>It's not my thing, going to bars or discos...
<br>Most of the time, I go to concerts with the other rRs and friends ... Well, you know, what I'm talking about...
<br>In my spare time, I am not doing something very exciting, except intoxicating myself, playing basketball
<br>or playing a bit on my guitar ... At the moment I am making a band with a few other pendejos...
<br>[âlo Beso Negro] ... next week, we got our first little concert, on the birthday of our bass-player ... :-]
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>... Oh, the sausages are becoming coals. Well, you won't have problems with groupies yet, not yet.
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Weeell ... nearly ... Well some time ago ... 3 weeks ago from today, I had something with a cute blonde...
<br>Really noble ... => *wooow fresh* She had picked me and eeo up on the bb-place...
<br>The only thing that bothered were her two kids ... =)
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>You think of those, who always said mother to her?
<p>rastafarie:
<br>héhé ... *fuuuuuck*
<p>dr.g0nZo:
<br>0kAY. Was a nice barbecue-session, the world has not become wealthier, thinking of the level of the mind.
<br>Thanks for the thing with the Jackass-style pukeing dog, and for your time.
<br>Do you want to greet someone?
<p>rastafarie:
<br>Vrallé ... Greetings to all rR and ex-members and all phucked up borrachos from Beso Negro and everyone reading this article.
