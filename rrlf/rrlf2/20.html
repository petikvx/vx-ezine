<p><b><u>Revolution - Step 2 by El DudErin0 & rastafarie</u></b>
<p>The following is a (more or less good) translation from the true bible.
<br>The original writing is in German and can be viewed here:

<p>And the Godfather said:
<p>rrlf 17,23
<p>"And the time shall come, in that the world is ruled by big tobacco-industries.
<br>And the humans will consum tobacco, because the awful ones will mix their products
<br>with substances that addict and the cleanness of the goods will get to an soon end.
<br>But not that alone makes the totality of the nasty, that I predict you.
<br>Also the companies will fight against my plant, the plant, that I brought you,
<br>for you to smoke it and produce heavenexulting effusions of your soul.
<p>²But I say to you, don't be afraid, for there will come, the five men from the slop,
<br>and they will bring you everlasting peace. They will put theirselves in long meetings
<br>mutual in trance and reprogram their brains with psycho-therapy, so that in the name
<br>of the father no longer the desire for one of the terrible cancer-sticks tortures them.
<br>Yes, and they will call it their "rRlf-project". And after they managed to turn away from the tobacco,
<br>their souls will recognize the true peace. And they will design books or tv-shows worldwide,
<br>which help the humans putting their minds to a tobacco-denying attitude. And the time will come,
<br>in which the paradise is no more far away, and my plant adorns the road-borders and is smoked
<br>by every man and every woman and I will be able to rest again.³"
<p>And then Eris came and and slapped gods face and said: FNORD
