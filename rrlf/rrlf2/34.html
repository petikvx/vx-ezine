<p><b><u>Strange Article - No silly jokes! by Rantanplan83</u></b>
<p>One day I found this strange mail from a friend of mine in my mailbox.
<br>I liked it, and asked him, if we could take this for our zine. He said yes, so here we are.
<br>This is a more or less good translation, because the original is in German, and can be viewed here:

<p>Hello philet0ast3r! For I had nothing special to do today, and there's no good liquor in the house,
<br>I thought: Now you do some real bullshit, just for some change! And because I don't like those silly
<br>Americans (97,85% of them) I sent this little declaration to the German embassy in USA, with the
<br>request, to translate this text into Englisch [note of the translator: ;], and to order stupid Clinton
<br>to declare this great writing as valid (I just said I am the official emperor of England, very clever,
<br>isn't it? They sure believe me!!). I hope CIA won't visit me soon. Well, god save the queen!
