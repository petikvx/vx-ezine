ARCV NEWS                                                              003.
 
                 The Association of Really Cruel Viruses.


     This is one of the first English Computer Underground groups, although
we are an English organisation we can only be contacted through American or
Eastern Europe Virus boards.  Or we will contact through a Fidonet address.

                             What is The ARCV.

     ARCV is a organisation that is involved in Writing and Research of
computer viruses.  We hold a Library of IBM Computer viruses for the use of
the ARCV members.  But as a group we are involved in viruses for most the
main computer types (IBM PC, AMIGA, ST, MAC).  We have a Bi-Monthly
newsletter with the latest virus news from around the country and from
around the world, virus Dis-Assemblies and other virus Debug Scripts.  We
have links with PHALCON/SKISM in the US, we also have links with some
Eastern Europe Virus writers.  Are group is not only limited to virus
activities but other 'Underground' activities also (Hacking, Phreaking
etc.) so any new members who don't write viruses could be involved in any
of the other activities we are involved in.

     Are members come from the youths of today, at the moment we are mainly
English students that wish to beat and know more about the system.  We come
from a range of backgrounds from the Electronics side and the Computer
side, I myself Apache Warrior come mainly from the Electronics side but
branched to the Computer side fully around 2 years ago.  I Hack, Phreak and
write Viruses, I am the President of the group (after all I started the
group) and I am some what of an expert on beating the BT phone exchange and
being a BBS A HOLIC that comes in very handy.  Now ICE-9 is also a
Electronics guy who turned to the computer he writes viruses and is into
Heavy Metal.  Now the picture put out by the Anti-Virus Authors is that
Virus writers are Sad individuals who wear Anoraks and go Train Spotting
but well they are sadly mistaken, we are very intelligent, sound minded,
highly trained, and we wouldn't be seen in an Anorak or near an Anorak even
if dead.

     We aim to provide the ARCV members and some Non-Members an insight to
the computer underground world and would you believe it is huge.  The Group
is always seeking new members and we require new members to stay afloat,
soon we will be opening the world HQ in the UK this will have special
access areas for the ARCV members these will include access to the ARCV
Virus Library, all of which are legit viruses and No Trojans.
