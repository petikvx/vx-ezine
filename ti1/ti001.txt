Techno Phunk:   Way to go.  Amazing how far you come in the last year.
                You'll become a major pain in the arse to AV guys if you
                keep this rate up.
Owl[FS]:        Get back soon.  I'll look forward to seeing some quality
                products from you soon.
Blacksmith Tony: ;)  Too much anime, man.
