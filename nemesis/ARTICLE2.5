     This is a list of the most common and toughest questions and concerns
we've gotten on the street talking to people about hemp re-legalization. 
In order to get our hemp rap tighter and thus be more effective, we should
all know good answers to these questions.     -- L.K.
 

     This FAQ is an attempt to fit reams of life-saving, liberty-
protecting, mind-changing, reality-altering ideas, facts and information
into as small a space as possible, made readable for everyone in one
sitting, (who speaks english, sorry -- anyone willing to translate?)  As a
result, much of the superfluous information has been sacrificed to make
room for more ideas.  The information can be found in the sources cited at
the end, which we encourage everyone to read.  --B.S.J.

----------------------------------------------------------------

I)                   WHAT'S ALL THIS FUSS ABOUT HEMP?


1a)  What is hemp? 
 
     For our purposes, hemp is the plant called `cannabis sativa.'  There
are other plants that are called hemp, but cannabis hemp is the most useful
of these plants.  In fact, `cannabis sativa' means `useful (sativa) hemp
(cannabis)'. 

     `Hemp' is any durable plant that has been used since pre-history for
many purposes.  Fiber is the most well known product,  and the word `hemp'
can mean the rope or twine which is made from the hemp plant, as well as
just the stalk of the plant that produced it.


 b)  What is cannabis? 

     Cannabis is the most durable of the hemp plants, and it produces the
toughest cloth, called `canvass.'  (Canvass was widely used as sails in the
early shipping industry, as it was the only cloth which would not rot on
contact with sea spray)  The cannabis plant also produces three other very
important products which the other hemp plants do not (in usable form, that
is): pulp, seed, and medicine.

     The pulp is used as fuel, and to make paper.  The seed is suitable for
both human and animal foods.  The oil from the seed can be used in as a base
for paints and varnishes.  The medicine is a tincture or admixture of the 
sticky resin in the blossoms and leaves of the hemp plant, and is used for 
a variety of purposes.


 c)  Where did the word `marijuana' come from? 
 
     The word `marijuana' is a Mexican slang term which became popular in
the late 1930's in America, during a series of media and government
programs which we now refer to as the `Reefer Madness Movement.'  It refers
specifically to the medicine part of cannabis.

     Today in the U.S., hemp (meaning the roots, stalk, and stems of the
cannabis plant) is legal to possess.  No one can arrest you for wearing a
hemp shirt, or using hemp paper.  Marijuana (The flowers, buds, or leaves
of the cannabis plant) is not legal to possess, and there are stiff fines
and possible jail terms for having any marijuana in your possession.  The
seeds are legal to possess and eat, but only if they are sterilized (will
not sprout.)

     Since it is not possible to grow the hemp plant without being in
possession of marijuana, the United States does not produce any industrial
hemp products, and must import them or, more often, substitute others.


2a)   How can hemp be used as a food? 

     Hemp seed is a highly nutritious source of protein and essential fatty
oils.  Many populations have grown hemp for its seed -- most of them eat it
as `greul' which is a lot like oatmeal.  Hemp is competitive to soy in
protein production.

     Hemp seeds have a nutty taste.  Hemp leaves can be used as roughage,
but not without slight psycho-active side-effects.  Hemp seeds do not get
you high.


 b)   What are the benefits of hemp compared to other food crops?
 
     Hemp requires little fertilizer, and grows well almost everywhere.  It
also resists pests, so it uses little pesticides.  Hemp puts down deep
roots, which is good for the soil, and when the leaves drop off the hemp
plant, minerals are returned to the soil.  Hemp has been grown on the same
soil for twenty years in a row without any noticeable depletion of the
soil.

     Using less fertilizer and agricultural chemicals is good for two
reasons.  First, it costs less and requires less effort.  Second, many
agricultural chemicals are dangerous and contaminate the environment -- the
less we have to use, the better.

 c)   How about soy?  Is hemp competitive as a world source of protein?

     Hemp seed protein more closely resembles that of the human body than
soy; it is also easier to digest.  Hemp contains a richer source of essential
fatty acid oils than soy.  These oils prevent heart disease and build the
immune system.

     Hemp also resists UV-B light, which is a kind of sunlight that is
blocked by the ozone layer.  Soy beans do not take UV-B light very well. 
If the ozone layer were to deplete by 16%, which by some estimates is very
possible, soy production would fall by 25-30%.  We may have to grow hemp or
starve -- and it won't be the first time that this has happened.  (Hemp has
been used to `bail out' many populations in time of famine.)


3a)   How can hemp be used as a fuel? 
 
     The pulp (hurd) of the hemp plant can be burned as fuel or processed
into charcoal, methanol, methane, or gasoline.  The process for doing this
is called destructive distillation, or `pyrolysis.'  Fuels made out of 
plants like this are called `biomass' fuels.


 b)  Why is it better than petroleum? 

     Biomass fuels are clean and virtually free from metals and sulfur, but 
more importantly, the carbon dioxide which is released when you burn biomass
fuels did not come from under the ground, it came from the air.  This way,
the total amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere does not
change.  When petroleum products are burned, carbon is added to the air,
this may contribute to global warming through the ``Greenhouse Effect,'' (a
popular theory which says that certain gasses will act like a blanket over
the entire Earth, preventing heat from escaping into space.)

 
4a)   How can hemp be used for cloth? 
 
     The fibre (bast) of the hemp plant can be woven into almost any kind
of cloth.  It is very durable.  In fact, the first Levi's blue jeans were
made out of hemp for just this reason.


 b)   Why is it better than cotton? 

     The cloth that hemp makes may be a little less soft than cotton,
(though there also may be special kinds of hemp, or ways to grow hemp, that
can produce a soft cloth) but it is much stronger and longer lasting. (It
does not stretch out.)

     For the same reasons mentioned above, hemp is a better crop to grow
than cotton.  In the United States, the cotton crop uses half of the total
pesticides.  (Yes, you heard right, one half of the pesticides used in the
entire U.S. are used on cotton.)       

     Cotton is a soil damaging crop and needs a lot of fertilizer.

 
5a)   How can hemp be used as a medicine? 
 
     Hemp has thousands of possible uses in medicine.  Just one of the 400+
chemicals in hemp, THC, could replace up to 30% of the pharmaceutical on
the market today.

     Marijuana, actually cannabis extract, was available as a medicine
legally in this country until 1937, and was sold as a nerve tonic.

     Marijuana appears in almost every known book of medicine written by
ancient scholars and wise men.  It is usually ranked among the top
medicines, or `panaceas.'  It was used as a pain reliever and in childbirth
(oxytoxant).

     The most well known use of marijuana today is to control nausea and
vomiting -- one of the most important things when treating cancer or AIDS
with chemo-therapy or AZT.  Other well known uses are for glaucoma (an eye 
disease that makes you go blind), multiple sclerosis, and a wide range
of other diseases which involve involuntary muscle spasms.


 b)  What's wrong with all the prescription drugs we have? 

     They cost money and are hard to make.  In some cases, they do not work
as well, either.  Some prescription drugs which marijuana can replace have
very bad side effects.  Cannabis medicines are cheap, safe, and easy to make. 


6a)  How can hemp be used to make paper? 
 
     Both the fiber (bast) and pulp (hurd) of the hemp plant can be used to
make paper.  Fiber paper was the first kind of paper, and the first batch
of that was made out of hemp in ancient China.  Fibre paper is tough,
brittle, and a bit rough, and does not hold together as well as pulp paper,
especially when it is wet.  

     Pulp paper is softer than fibre paper.  It is the kind of paper we use
most today.  The pulp works like glue, holding small bits of fiber
together.  Sometimes fiber is added to pulp paper to add strength.

     An acre of cannabis hemp will replace four acres of trees in pulp
paper production.


 b)  Why can't we just keep using trees? 

     In order to make paper out of tree pulp, a substance called `lignin'
must be broken down.  In order to do this, the pulp must be soaked in
powerful acid.  These acids contaminate the environment.  Some paper
companies clean the acid out with zinc oxide, but zinc oxide is also
dangerous.  Paper made from trees is often whitened with chemicals which
are alleged to be dangerous, like dioxin.  Hemp pulp has no lignin and
whitens with much less difficulty.

     A simpler answer to the above question is:

     Because we are running out!  Way back in the 1930's, the USDA was
already worried about our `tree supply.'  That is why they went in search
of plant pulp to replace wood.  They found hemp, but could not use it until
someone made a machine to strip the pulp from the fibre -- but that is
another story -- See the next section.

     Today, only 4% of America's old-growth forest remains standing -- and
there is talk about building roads into that for logging purposes!


7)  What other uses for hemp are there?

     One of the newest uses of hemp is in construction materials.  Hemp
can be used in the manufacture of `press board' or `composite board.'  This
involves gluing hemp stalk fiber together under pressure to produce a
board which is many times more elastic and durable than hardwood.  Because
hemp produces a long, tough fibre it is the perfect source for press-board.

     Another interesting application of hemp in industry is making plastic.
Many plastics can be made from the high-cellulose hemp hurd.  Plastics made
this way are more environmentally safe than those made from fossil fuels.
`Bio-plastics' are not a new idea -- way back in the 1930's Henry Ford had
already made a whole car out of them -- but the processes for making them 
do need more research and development.  Unfortunately, companies are not
likely to do this if they have to either import the raw materials or break 
the law...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


II)                         PROHIBITION - WHY?


1)   How and why was hemp made illegal?

     As just stated, The United States Department of Agriculture first
proposed making paper from hemp pulp in the early 1930's.  Production had
to wait, though, until somebody made a machine to separate the hemp pulp
(hurd) from the fiber (bast) cheaply.

     In the meantime, a group of companies -- Dupont chemicals, Hearst
paper and timber, and several others, developed a new way to make whiter
paper out of trees.  Just when they got all their patents and business
dealings worked out in 1936, someone invented the hemp `decorticating'
machine.

     Since hemp paper is cheaper to make, this threatened to put all of the
tree-paper companies out of business.  A huge sum of capital was tied up in
making tree pulp paper and shipping it for sale.  Most of the tree-paper
people were very powerful and had a lot of government connections.  One of
them, William Randolph Hearst, even owned an entire newspaper chain.

     In 1937, they launched a country-wide campaign to put a prohibitive
tax on hemp.  This was the first `Reefer Madness Movement'  (The second
came in the 70's under Nixon.)  This is when we began to call cannabis
`marijuana.'  `Marijuana' is a Mexican slang term which was relatively
obscure until the newspapers made it a household word -- synonymous with
evil.

     The Hearst newspapers played all the angles.  Articles were written
specifically to horrify the public about the dangers of marijuana.  Stories
were concocted about `axe-murderers' and sensationalistic tactics were used
to blame heinous crimes on marijuana.  The articles often took racist
overtones, in order to capitalize on the then prevalent feelings of the
average American towards Blacks, and Mexicans.   In fact, it was this
racism which was responsible for most of the anti-*marijuana* legislation
previously passed in state legislatures -- Hearst and company just used
this momentum to include hemp, in a way it is ironic that the racism
of the American people would end up hurting them this way.

2)   Wait -- why didn't we pass a better law?  Why didn't somebody say
something about hemp and stop them?  How do you expect me to believe that
no one knew marijuana was really cannabis hemp?

     Well, did you know all the stuff about cannabis that was in the first
section?  If so, you are a rare bird, my friend.  (During Reefer Madness
II, all mention of the word `hemp' was pretty much removed from our high-
school curriculums, museums, history books, etc.  A Smithstonian curator
was quoted as saying ``Children don't need to know about hemp, it 
confuses them.'')

     By the time the 1937 Tax Act (which proposed to levy a prohibitive tax
on the sale of small quantities of marijuana) reached Congress, the country
was in an uproar over `that killer weed with roots in hell, marijuana.' 
The average American citizen was totally unaware that marijuana and
cannabis hemp were the same plant (most of them didn't know where their
clothes used to come from, anyway, because synthetic fabrics had just
become popular.)  To make matters worse, the word `hemp' was often wrongly
used to refer to other natural fabrics, specifically jute.
  
     Those that did know decided to put their faith in other, newer crops
and technology.  This was before anyone could see how ecologically
devastating these crops and technologies would become.  Senators were
inundated with mail from parents groups and organized grass roots lobbying. 
To them it was a simple issue of obeying the will of the people -- or not
getting re-elected!

     This is not to say that no one protested, just that they were a small
voice in the din of Reefer Madness.  Numerous industries sent
representatives to protest the usefulness of hemp.  One of the loudest
protesters, though, was the American Medical Association, which could not
believe that the Congress would try to ban a useful medicine like cannabis,
and was angered that they had not been told that the `two' plants,
marijuana and cannabis, were one in the same when they were asked for
endorsement.

     [You can read all of this in the Congressional records.]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next obvious question is -- why is it STILL illegal?  But we will delay
answering this until later.

Let us first take a look at some of the most common questions which we have
today about marijuana use -- mainly, is it safe?
What about all those scary statistics?  What would legalization be like?

Many of these questions come from anti-legalization arguments about why
marijuana should be kept illegal.  You will see that many of the `reasons'
such groups give are actually just left-over hysteria from the Reefer
Madness movements, with no basis in fact.

[For proof that these arguments are still used by prohibitionists, see
the 1988 U.S. Customs Dept. pamphlet ``Marijuana -- the Gateway Drug.'']
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


III)                DOESN'T IT?,  DOES IT?,  HOW WOULD?


1a)  Doesn't Marijuana cause brain damage?

     The short answer:  No.

     The long answer:  The reason why you ask this is because you probably
heard or read somewhere that marijuana damages brain cells, or makes you
stupid.  These claims are untrue.  

     The first one -- marijuana kills brain cells -- is based on research
done during the second Reefer Madness Movement.  A study attempted to show
that marijuana smoking damaged brain structures in monkeys.  However, the
study was poorly performed and it was severely criticized by a medical
review board.  Studies done afterwards failed to show any brain damage.

     But this was Reefer Madness II, and the prohibitionists were looking
for anything to keep the marijuana legalization movement in check, so this
study was widely used in anti-marijuana propaganda, until it was recanted
later.  

     (To this day, the anti-drug groups will sometimes slip up and use
it -- In fact, America's most popular drug `education' program, Drug Abuse
Resistance Education uses it.  The D.A.R.E. officer's training manual
contains a fact sheet from the National Institute on Drug Abuse which
says that marijuana ``can impair memory perception & judgement by destroying
brain cells.''  When police and teachers read this and believe it, our job
gets really tough, since it takes a long time to explain to children how
Ms. Jones and Officer Bob were wrong.)

     The truth is, no study has ever demonstrated cellular damage,
stupidity, mental impairment, or insanity brought on specifically by 
marijuana use -- even heavy marijuana use.  This is not to say that it 
cannot be abused, however.
 
 b)  If it doesn't kill brain cells, how does it get you `high'?

     Killing brain cells is not a pre-requisite for getting `high.'  
Marijuana contains a chemical which substitutes for a natural brain
chemical, with a few differences.  This chemical touches special `buttons'
on brain cells called `receptors.'  Essentially, marijuana `tickles' brain 
cells.  The legal drug alcohol also tickles brain cells, but it will
damage and kill them by producing toxins (poisons) and sometimes mini-seizures.


2)   Isn't smoking marijuana worse for you than smoking cigarettes? 

     There are many reasons why it is not.  The first is that marijuana
smokers generally don't chain smoke, and so they smoke less. (Marijuana is
not physically addictive.)

     The second is that tobacco contains nicotine, and marijuana doesn't. 
Nicotine hardens the arteries and is responsible for much of the heart
disease caused by tobacco.

     The third is that marijuana contains THC.  THC is a bronchial dilator,
which means it works like a Hall's cough drop and opens up your lungs,
which aids clearance of smoke and dirt.  Nicotine does just the opposite;
it makes your lungs bunch up and makes it harder to cough anything up.

     The fourth is that there are benefits from marijuana (besides
bronchial dilation) that you don't get from tobacco.  Mainly, marijuana
makes you relax, which improves your health and well-being.

     The fifth is that scientists do not really know what it is that causes
malignant lung cancer in tobacco.  Some think it may be a substance known
as Lead 210.  Of course, there are many other theories as to what does
cause cancer, but if this is true, it is easy to see why NO CASE OF LUNG
CANCER RESULTING FROM MARIJUANA USE ALONE HAS EVER BEEN DOCUMENTED, because
tobacco contains much more of this substance than marijuana.

     You may have heard that `one joint is equal to 10 cigarettes'  This is
based on studies which measured the tar content of cannabis and tobacco
leaves.  Marijuana smokers prefer the bud, though, which is much cleaner.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     
A NOTE:  This isn't to say that smoking marijuana is not bad for your lungs,
but consider for a moment this list of things that make marijuana less 
dangerous to use:

o  filters:  like cigarette filters

o  pipes (or bowls):  burn cleaner than a `joint'

o  water pipes:  bubble the smoke through water to `wash' it
   
o  smoking bud instead of leaf:  reduces the tar content and consumption

o  eating it instead of smoking:  entirely eliminates any lung damage

o  extracting the THC into a drink or inhaler: also eliminates lung damage 

     All of these things are made harder by marijuana laws.  Pipes,
especially water-pipes, are usually illegal by city or state law.  Filtered
cigarettes and inhalers would be wider used if they were mass produced,
which is hard to arrange `underground.'  People can't eat the marijuana
because you need more to get high that way, and it isn't cheap or easy to
get -- which is the reason why some people will stoop to smoking leaves.

     This may sound funny to you -- but the more legal marijuana gets,
the safer it is.  In addition to the above, legal marijuana would be
clean and free from adulturants (other drugs added to the marijuana.)  It
would also stand less of a chance of being sprayed with pesticides or
contaminated with dangerous fungi.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)   Doesn't marijuana stay in your fatty cells and affect you for up to a
month?

     THC breaks down quickly after entering your body, into inert molecules
known as `metabolites,' which don't get you high.  It is the metabolites
that get stored in fat cells and slowly leave -- not the THC.  Only trace
levels of THC remain after several hours, not enough to affect you at all.

     It is the metabolites that urine tests look for, so if a person tests
positive on a urine test, It does not mean he was `stoned' when he took the
test -- just that he smoked within the last 30 days.

     Many anti-drug pamphlets say that THC gets stored in your 
fat cells and then leaks out later, acting like a `time release capsule'
and keeping you high for months.  These claims are totally untrue.

4)   Is marijuana addictive? 
 
     Marijuana produces no withdrawal symptoms no matter how heavy it is
used.  It is habit forming (psychologically addictive), but not 
physically addictive.


5)   I heard that there are over 400 chemicals in marijuana... Wellllll...? 
 
     True, but so what?  There are also over 400 chemicals in many foods,
[including coffee, which contains 800 chemicals and many rat carcinogens]
and I don't see police arresting people in McDonald's, or giving Driving
while Eating citations.  Only THC is very psycho-active, a few other
cannabinoids also have small degrees of psycho-activity.  People who use
marijuana do not get sick more, or die earlier, or lose their jobs [except
to drug tests], or have mutant kids... so what's your point? 


6)   I forgot, does marijuana cause memory impairment?

     Marijuana affects short-term memory, but does not `impair' it.  It
simply makes you remember different things.  This could be considered good
or bad.  Heavy marijuana smokers have been tested and were perfectly
functional and well adjusted.  They performed well on tests and seemed
normal.  

     For first-time smokers, this effect is exaggerated.  Most experienced
marijuana smokers will tell you that once you get used to marijuana, you
can remember things more normally.  Much of the short-term memory loss
may be due to the distraction of being stoned, as you simply do not pay
attention to some things.  Some of the loss may be a result of direct chemical
action on your brain.  A tolerance to these effects will build up during
long periods of use.

 
7)   Marijuana impairs the immune system, increasing the susceptibility 
to AIDS. 

     This, too, has not been proven.  It is based off
hysterical claims made on national television by former drug czar Carlton
Turner, for which he presented no valid research.


8)   Hey, don't you know that marijuana drops testosterone levels in
teenage boys causing [various physical and developmental problems]? 
 
     Marijuana does not turn young healthy boys into lanky, girlish looking
wimps, no.  This scare tactic (call it homo-phobic if you will) was a common
device used in early anti-drug literature.  It attempts to scare boys away
from marijuana by telling them, essentially, that it will turn them into a
girl.       

     The studies which are cited, where they exist, are mostly
faulty or misinterpreted.  This is not to say that marijuana use does not
affect childhood development at all, just that the effects are not as
drastic as some people would like them to sound.  In fact they are pretty
much unknown.


9)   Doesn't heavy marijuana use lower the sperm count in males? 

     Not by much, (if at all) and this can be a good thing.  It does not make 
you impotent or sterile.  (If it did -- there would be no Rastafarae or Zion
Coptic Christians left!)  Give those testicles a rest, already!


10)  I heard marijuana use by teenage girls may impair hormone production,
menstrual cycles, and fertility.  Is this true?

     Also unproven and unfounded, but there is no data available to tell
either way, (and it won't be coming from the U.S. -- current U.S. laws
prohibit research on women, even if marijuana studies could get funding --
which they cannot, generally.)

     This is the female analog to the boy's ``It'll turn you into a sissy''
tactic.  As far as anyone knows, It is only a scare tactic.
 

11)  Don't children born to pot-smoking mothers suffer from ``Fetal
Marijuana Syndrome?''

     Studies conducted in Jamaica show that heavy marijuana use can cause
the baby to develop differently -- it weighs more, cries less, and seems
more curious and explorative, -- otherwise they show no difference.  All of
these things are good.  But those who aren't so sure about this will be
relieved to know that this only happens to children of heavy users.

     THC does cross the barrier to the fetus, but does not cause any
horrible diseases or malformations like Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.  Also,
chronic abuse of marijuana may cause problems.  Whether the studies done
in Jamaica actually mean anything to mothers in the U.S. or other developed
countries is not known.


12)  Don't people die from smoking pot?

     Never, not a one.  [Well, maybe one, if you stretch it -- there is an
account of an African Tribesman who did Dagga (smoked marijuana, as
punishment) and he hit himself on the head too hard with a wooden club.]
 
     In contrast, many legal drugs cause tens to thousands of deaths per
year, foremost among them alcohol, nicotine, valium, aspirin, and caffiene.
 
13)   Isn't marijuana a gateway drug?  Doesn't it lead to use of harder
drugs? 

     This is totally untrue.  (In fact, research may be breaking soon that
shows that marijuana aids in kicking crack habits.)  If you do not believe
so, do the math.  There are 40 million people in this country (U.S.) who
have smoked marijuana for a period of their lives -- why aren't there 40
million heroin users, then?  In Amsterdam, both marijuana use and heroin
use went *down* after marijuana was decriminalized -- even though there
was a short rise in marijuana use right after decriminalization.

     The `gateway' or `stepping stone' hypothesis of drug use is no longer
generally accepted by the medical community.  On sociological grounds, the
a gateway theory has been argued which claims that marijuana is the source
of the drug subculture and leads to other drugs through that culture.  This
is untrue -- marijuana does not create the drug subculture, the drug
subculture uses marijuana.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This brings up another example of how marijuana legalization could actually
reduce the use of illicit drugs.  Even though there is no magical `stepping
stone' effect, people who choose to buy marijuana often buy from dealers
who deal in many different illegal drugs.  This means that they have access
to illegal drugs, and might decide to try them out.  If marijuana were 
legal, the drug markets would be separated, and less people would start 
using illegal drugs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

14)   Can't marijuana cause psychoses in some people?

     Marijuana does not `cause' psychosis.  Psychotic people can smoke
marijuana and have an episode, but there is not a consensus that marijuana
actually initiates or increases these episodes.  Of course, if a psychotic
is given marijuana for the first time or without his knowledge, they might
get scared and `freak.'

 
15)   Does marijuana impairment cause more driving accidents? 

     Not really.  The marijuana using public has the same or lower rate of
automobile accidents as the general public.  Studies of marijuana smoking
while driving showed that it does affect reaction time, but not nearly as
much as alcohol.  Also, those who drive `stoned' have been shown to be less
foolish on the road (they demonstrate `increased risk aversion'.)

     As funny as it may seem, you may be safer driving `stoned', as long as
you aren't `totally blasted' and seeing things -- but few people want to
drive in this state of mind, anyway.  Still, many people have reported  
making mistakes while driving because they were stoned.


16)   Is it true that marijuana makes you lazy and unmotivated?
 
     No, it doesn't -- ask the U.S. Army.  They did a study and showed no
effect.  If this were true, why would many Eastern cultures, and Jamaicans,
use marijuana as a work motivator (to help them work)? 


17)   I don't want children (minors) to be able to smoke marijuana.  How
can I stop this?

     Legalize it.

     They can smoke it now -- it is impossible to control.  There would be
less marijuana being sold in schools, playgrounds, and street corners,
though, if it was sold legally through pharmacies -- because the dealers
would not be able to compete with the prices.  

     Consider, also, that children have a natural urge to do things that
they aren't supposed to.  It is called curiosity.  By making such a fuss
over marijuana, you make it interesting.  This is the `forbidden fruit'
factor.


18)   Won't children be able to steal marijuana plants that people are
growing?

     Well, if you are worried about them stealing the hemp plants from the
paper-pulp farm down the road, you should know that the commercial grades
of hemp do not contain much THC (the stuff that gets you high.)  If they
were to smoke it, they would probably just get a headache.  Otherwise,
it should be the responsibility of the grower to take measures to prevent
this.  Most ``home-grown'' is cultivated indoors anyway.


19)   Is urine testing for marijuana use as a terms of employment a good
idea?

     No!  Some of your most brilliant, hard working, and reliable employees
are marijuana users.  When you drug test, you put all marijuana users in
the same place as the abusers -- the unemployment line.  Drug testing is
bad for business.  (Not to mention it is an invasion of privacy.)

     If a worker has a drug problem, you can tell by testing how well he
does his job.  Firing all the drug users who work for you will hurt your
business, costs money, and will get people very mad at you.

     Drug testing allows an employer to govern the actions of an employee
in his off time -- even when these actions do not effect his job
performance.  Asking employees to urinate in a plastic cup every month is
not a good way to make them feel like part of the business, or make
friends, either.


20)   I forgot, does marijuana cause short-term memory impairment?

      Go away.

21)   But ... isn't today's marijuana much more potent than it was
in the Sixties?  (Or, more often .... Marijuana is n times more powerful      
than it was in the Sixties!)

      GOOD!  Actually, this is not true, but if it were, it would
mean that marijuana was actually safer to smoke.  People who use this
statistic just plain do not know what they are talking about.  Sometimes
they will even claim that marijuana is now twenty to thirty times stronger,
which is physically impossible.  The truth is, marijuana has not really
changed potency all that much, if at all.

      Even so, the point is moot because marijuana smokers engage in
something called `auto-titration.'  This basically means smoking until
they are satisfied and then stopping, so it does not really matter
if the marijuana is more potent because they will smoke less of it.  
Since being `too stoned' is a rather unpleasant experience, smokers
quickly learn to take their time and go slowly when they smoke. 


22)   Shouldn't we just lock them (users) all up?

     How are you going to pay for it?  Already, ten percent of the people
in this country (U.S) are in custody.  Murderers and rapists are being paroled
right now to make room for a few more `deadheads' in prison.  The United
States leads the world in imprisonment -- at any one time, 425 people out
of every 100,000 are behind bars.

     Once a person gets put in jail, he becomes angry with the world.  By 
locking up drug users, you are digging yourself a very big trench to fall in --
is it worth it?

     Besides - lots of these people don't deserve to be in jail.  Why
should they serve time just because they like to get `high?'  Especially
when someone can drink alcohol without being arrested... what kind of law 
is that?

     You have to think about what kind of a world you are making for yourself
before you act.  How are the police of the future going to treat the people?
How far are you willing to let the government go to get the drug users?  How
many of your own rights will you sacrifice by trying to jail drug users?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


IV)                       Why is it STILL illegal?:

     The official answer:  Because you shouldn't use it.  You can't use it
because it is illegal, and it is illegal so you can't use it.  You should
not use it.  It is illegal.  It is illegal so you should not use it.  :-\

     The manic-depressive answer:  It'll never happen.  People are too
unorganized/stupid/disempowered.  It's just futility.  Try, but don't
expect to get anywhere.  I won't get my hopes up.

     The paranoid-schizophrenic answer:  Don't you SEE?!?!?  The guys at
the top have it SEWN!!  They own everything.  They'll never let it happen. 
I shouldn't even be talking to you, but let me give you some advice!! 
listen...  you shouldn't mess with THEM, THEY know everything.  THEY are
practically psychic, see?  And the only way to get it to happen is to
become one of THEM.  You'd better watch it, or THEY will come and take you
away -- THEY do that, you know.  It's all a CONSPIRACY!!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANOTHER SIDE-NOTE: Our fuzzy-headed friend here may be over-reacting a bit,
but there is some basis to his fears.  Many anti-drug operations receive
a lot of support from today's producers of legal drugs.  For example, I am
sure most of you have seen television advertisements warning you not to do
drugs, produced by the Partnership for a Drug Free America.  These are some
of the companies who pay for those commercials by donating money to the
PDFA:

     From 1988 to 1991, pharmaceutical companies and their beneficiaries 
     contributed as follows: 
     J. Seward Johnson, Sr., Charitable Trusts ($1,100,000)
     Du Pont ($150,000) 
     Proctor & Gamble Fund ($120,000)
     Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation ($110,000)
     Johnson & Johnson ($110,000)
     SmithKline Beecham ($100,000)
     Merck Foundation ($75,000)
     Hoffman-La Roche ($50,000)
 
     (doesn't include donations under $90,000)

     Tobacco and Alcohol companies:

     donations from the tobacco and alcohol kings: The Partnership has
     Phillip Morris ($150,000) 
     Anheuser-Busch ($150,000)
     RJR Reynolds ($150,000)
     American Brands (Jim Beam, Lucky Strike). ($100,000)
 
     Also, doesn't it seem odd that the advertisements produced by the 
PDFA rarely, if ever, warn youngsters about the very dangerous *legal* drugs,
like sniffing glue or paint thinner, smoking tobacco, and drinking alcohol?
Perhaps there is a little more to this `War on Drugs' than meets the eye.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The neurotic answer:  Marijuana?  Eeek!  Don't you know that stuff is
dangerous?  People don't make laws for no good reason, you know!  Where did
you hear about marijuana?  Wait!  Don't tell me, I don't want to know.  If
anybody even knew you thought it should be legal -- well -- they'd never
talk to you again!  Don't you know that marijuana this... marijuana that...
...  ...   ...



     THE REAL ANSWER:  Marijuana is still illegal because enough people
have not yet stood up together and said:


     `` THIS IS STUPID!!


             I WANT CANNABIS HEMP LEGAL!!!


                   FOR PRODUCTS;


                          FOR MEDICINE;


                                 FOR FOOD;


                                        FOR FUN;


        FOR GOODNESS'S SAKE!  ISN'T THAT WHAT LIFE'S ALL ABOUT ? ''

     Without large-scale grass roots support, marijuana will never be
legal.  Every person that stands up for marijuana/hemp legalization makes
us that much stronger, and our voices that much louder.  Believe me, we
appreciate all the support we get.  Almost as importantly, it makes it that
much harder for people to say ``that's a stupid idea'' or ``nobody really
believes that.''
     If you aren't convinced yet, I encourage you to learn more about the
issues.  Try the sources listed at the end.
     If you're with us, let us know!  Let everybody know, unless it will
get you canned or arrested, but most importantly, keep an eye on what's
going on, and try to lend a hand when you can.  Also, know your stuff, so
if you have to, you can convince a friend or loved one that *you* are not
nuts -- the rest of the world is.
