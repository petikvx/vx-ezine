Where the Coyotes Roamed: The Fall of the Scene
                      by: Nemesis

        I was recently asked to write a small article about how bad the
scene was and this and that. I basically was asked to bitch. Instead I'd
prefer to look beyond just how bad things are, and are going to be, and
point towards the reasons.
        It all begins with affordability. In 1980 a PC cost $4000+
dollars and did practically nothing. Now a high end Pentium can be
purchased for $2500 and the prices fluctuate daily. Anyone can own some
sort of PC. A new 386 goes for around $800 chock full of goodies.
Originally only the wealthy or the truly interested could afford the
computers but now anyone can get one.
        Next comes ease. When DOS ruled the PC world people were
dumbfounded by it's annoying syntax and errors. It was so difficult for
most people to use they didn't. When windows hit the market everything
was rearranged. You didn't have to do anything it was just there. Want to
install a new program? Just go to filemanager and hit install. What to
delete files? Just go to file manager. So anyone with an IQ of 65 or
higher can now functionally operate the computer. The problem comes
because if you ask them what kind of hardware they have, the won't know.
Ask them if they know what a preftech cache is and they say no. Most
of them won't even know what a CPU is. This ignorance of the computer is
every graphical interface's downfall. When working with a shell like
UNIX/DOS you learn how the memory functions because you are constantly
plagued with it. You learn that you will run out of HD space and what
your HD is, how fast it is, how it compares with others. With windows
all of that is hidden from the end user.
        Next is the so called "information superhighway". This
non-existent hype from companies like AT&T helps lure people into the
telcom world. When they purchase there windows pre-installed system it
comes with prodigy, america online, and compuserve demos. They
immediately begin racking up huge phone bills to call these services
with their lowly credit cards. The little graphical world shows them
that computers are simple and beautiful. Why with a few clicks of a
button I have the newest pictures of sheep with women in 3D! Then comes
the internet. Lovely companies like NetCom provide software like
netrunner. Once on the internet, where there are no moderators to
control what happens, they are flooded with profanity, pornography,
hacking, warez chat, and more. They are often appalled but curious about
where this stuff comes from. A simple hop into IRC gives them all they
need to know...phone numbers, inet sites, www sites, and anything else
inbetween.
        Thusly, they reach our world. That which is not part of the
information superhighway but which are lone dirt roads in the desert
leading to ghost towns.
        I now conclude my little article. There was no calling people
morons or lamers. Just a bunch of ignorant people moving into the
territory always considered sacred to the few that could roam there. It's
hard to tell who's real these days and who's fake. Information usually
only available to the special and few is now in the hands of everyone and
anyone. Because of this, legislation may be passed prohibiting it's
distribution and publication; An infringement on our basic constitutional
rights.
