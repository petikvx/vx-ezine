Knockin' on Heavens Door: Poisons Available For You
                      by: Nemesis (of course)

NOTE: 99.9% of this information came from the Toxicology Handbook, a book
      released yearly by the US government. If you are looking for more
      specific details, that's the place to start. It contains detailed
      info on every known available poison in the world.

Amanta Phalloides

 Amanta Phalloides is a type of mushroom. It is completely indistinguishable
from it's edible cousin, Agaricus Campestris, except by it's tiny white
bumps. When cooked, no detoxification takes place (unlike some plant
species where heating destroys the natural poisons). Simply serve it
to an unexpected victim in a soup or salad. In approximately 12 hours
the victim with get nauseas. Death will occur within 2-3 days from circulatory
collapse unless they seek medical attention within 2 days but since all
the symptoms point toward flu. Even if medical attention is recieved after
3 days and they remove the poison liver failure will occur causing death.

Arsenic

 Arsenic is a poison well known due to the fact that murder mysteries
often use it to kill off some victim somewhere in the book. Arsenic
comes in the form of a white, tasteless, orderless powder. It will kill
a victim in large doeses (1 gram or more) in three to four days. The
victim dies from circulatory collapse. Another method is a slow death
method where small doses are given to a victim over a period of time.
This results in a very painful death. The victims hair will fall out,
nerve paralysis will set in, numbness, and complete paralysis are possible.
Unfortunately the victim may build a tolerance to arsenic if the dosages
are too low and then even large doeses may not affect them. Better still,
some people have natural immunity to arsenic.

Carbon Monoxide

 Carbon Monoxide is a tasteless, orderless, and colerless gas that prevent
our blood cells from being able to carry oxygen to body cells. Death
is caused by suffocation. Early symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning
include headaches, shortness of breath, tinitus, and a form of intoxication.
Later affects include red discoleration of the skin, a Cheyne-Stokes
pattern of breathing, massive fever, and unconsciousness.

Curare

 Curare is a drug that prevents the nerves in the victims body to transmit
signals to muscles. This results in paralysis from head to toe. Death
is from suffication when the poison reaches the respritory system and
the victim is no longer able to breath. Symptoms come in stages begining
with drooping of the eyes, inablility to swallow or speak, and then
the inability to breath. After that, well, the victim is dead.

Cyanide

 Cyanide is similar to carbon monoxide poisoning. It prevents the red
blood celss ability to carry oxygen to the cells. It has all the same
symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.

Strychnine

 Strychnine is a horrid posion that can kill in less than fifteen minutes.
The victim is racked with terrifying muscle spasms which contort the
body until the victim's bones break. This is not a pleasent way to die.

Thallium

 Thallium is a odorless, tasteless, white poison that must be ingested.
Symptoms begin to occur four or more days after consumption. Early symptoms
include constipation, diffuse pain, and psychological disturbances.
Two weeks after consumption the victim will lose all body hair, the
skin with turn scaley, heart palpitations will begin, and paralysis
will set in, followed by blindness. Death occurs due to pnewmonia and
lung congestion. It may be administered in small doses over several
months, like arsenic.

Ethylene Glycol

 Ethylene Glycol is simply antifreeze. It has a sickenly sweet taste
which can easily be hidden by sweet drinks. The fatal dose of Ethylene
Glycol is approximately 100g. Di-Ethylene Glycol is presumably less.
These both produce kidney and brain damage.  Initial symptoms include
a state of intoxication followed by vomitting, cyanosis, headache,
tachynpea, tachycardia, hypotesion, pulmonary edema, muscle tenderness,
stupor, anuria, prostration, and unconsiousness with convulsions. The
cause of death is unkown.

Phosgene Gas

 Phosgene gas is produced by heating carbon tetrachloride. It has the
oder of musty hay. The lethal dosage is 0.1ppm (parts per million).
The cause of death is cirulatory and respiratory failure. During WWII,
the German army stockpiled phosgene as a chemical weapon. Carbon
tetrachloride is commonly available and simply needs to be heated to
release phosgene.

Nicotine

 Nicotine is a highly lethal poison. A single drop. Nicotine may be
available if extraced from nicotine patches which contains from 11g
to 20g (Wow, that's Alot!) The lethal dose is 40mg. Symptoms include
diziness, naseau, and unconsciousness. Death occurs between 5 minutes
to 4 hours. Higher doses can shorten that time.

Nicotine Sulfate

 Nicotine sulfate is a lethal poison that can be absorbed through the
skin if not thouroghly cleaned within seconds of contact. It used to be
available as a rat poison but obviously a few child accidents occurred
and it was banned in the US. It is still available in some 3rd world
countries.
