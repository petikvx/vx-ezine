        Who the hell are you?

        Actually I ran an H/P board for 5 years until one day, my
        system crashed and I lost all that I had saved. From that
        point on I called out little (and still call out little).
        I didn't cry too much over the smashed platter.

        The "scene" is dying (if not dead) and I am considered one
        of the old boys (though I don't know why, I'm 19). Many
        once called me "god" but now I see that it was all just a
        silly game with no winners.

        Back in the day I would have considered myself cool (never K00l)
        but now I am a little older and a little wiser.

        The days of hacking and trashing are long gone. The real
        hackers are becoming yuppies and the new hackers..well,
        don't exist but in delusions of 12 year olds too busy
        masturbating to realize how ignorant they really are. The
        world is changing but inborn human stupidity is not.

        All of this power is in the wrong hands, and has been all
        along. It's being manipulated and twisted and although I
        stand on a platform preaching, little can be done to find
        a solution, nevermind fix the problem.

        The empires are forming around us. The great corporate moguls,
        the lowly politician, the man on the street with a card begging
        for food. All of these are empires in their own right and all
        empires must fall to another. It's just a matter of which
        direction the empires fall.

        How many lies can one man tell to another. How many lies of
        his own and his brother can one man pass on to another. It
        is a vicious cycle which has persisted throughout.

        How much pain and waste does it take to realize that we are
        nothing.
