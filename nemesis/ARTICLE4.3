        Hell, there may not be a next issue. This was done in a fit of
    rage and never may be done again. Of course I also have enough stuff
    to fill a whole 'nother lame mag like this one. And of course I'll
    always accept submissions on anything not totally lame. So it is
    yet to be seen. Maybe I'll put in some graffix code...maybe I'll
    program it in assembler next time and have one of the articles the
    src to the viewer. Who the FUCK knows? Everyone smells. So, if you
    see Nemesis' Nifty Mag #2, then I wrote another one. 8)


        I entered into the abyss, and the abyss entered into me.
