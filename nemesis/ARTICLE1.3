        A Foreward

                I don't claim to be some sort of virus god. In fact,
        I'm just a beginner with big ideas. I will never say something
        like "I'm working on a multipartite, block moving, mutating
        EXE/COM/DLL/OVR/SYS/BAT/OBJ/BIN/GOD infector" since I probably
        never will write such a thing. You may see some simple memory
        resident and runtime virii with alot of simple avoidance
        techniques but nothing so grand as what is found in the VLAD or
        40HEX magazines.

        This entire thing and everthing in it was coded or written by
        Nemesis, Nemesis, and Nemesis.

        Greets go to:        Because:

        IIRG and Affiliates  Home of the a massive collection of good info
                             from hacking to phreaking to everything else.

        Skism/Phalcon        The virus guides/40Hex rules. Anyone that
                             complains that virus writing is too hard is
                             a loser. Since you released all the basics to
                             the public ANYONE can write at least a basic
                             com infector.

        Patricia Hoffman     Who's VSUM Index, although often containing
                             inacurate material, is still the best source
                             of generic virus info.

        All of you in the    Your meaningless "cyberbable" is amusing.

        Greets do not go to:

        McAffe               What the fuck? A 200 byte appending COM
                             infector gets by your scanner. Get a clue
                             and steal somebody elses source.

        The loser that decided we didn't need lots of registers and that
        blocks of 64k were a good idea. 20 bit addresses are stupid.
