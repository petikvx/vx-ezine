
        This was originally going to be a group release of some kind
        but since I have no group, and all groups are lame, I decided
        to release it under Nemesis' Nifty Mag. It could have been
        released under NWVA or FUK but both are less than up to par
        with what I would consider acceptable.

        All material in this mag was created by me (unless otherwise
        noted) and all credit goes to me. (reader, loader, and all).

        The reader is optional since all the files are standard texts.
        I did this so people on other platforms could read and enjoy
        my work. They are labeld article#.# with article0.0 being a
        text index of article#.#.

        Some of the articles contain UUECODED compiled copies of their
        respective source's program. This is for people without the
        proper compilers.

        If you find any of this information useful, than I did something
        right.
