<u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is Ghauri2</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ghauri2 is the name of Pakistan’s Nuclear War Head Carrier. I
selected this name because it scared the hell out of many at least here in
Pakistan.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Spread of Ghauri2</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">I don’t know what should I say…. I like to spread the virus………..
<font FACE="Wingdings">J</font> I think spreading a virus is also a nice
exercise and experience. After all one can also call it as part of VX Scene. OK!
So enough of it.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">How did I spread Ghauri2. Let me see.</p>
<ol TYPE="a">
  <ol TYPE="a">
    <li>I got hold of some email addresses from web pages like penpalnow.com and
      other. People from different part of worlds. Sending them the files and
      trying to convince them to open the files which they did in most of the
      cases. For those seeking for love I send them a nice poem titled
      &quot;Valentine poem of the Millenium&quot; (After all it was the end of
      millenium then). Anyway the poem is there at the end of this file.</li>
    <li>In my engineering univ there was 1 separate computer connected to laser
      printer. Everyone who wanted to have a printout had to insert the floppy
      in that computer as it wasn’t connected to the LAN. Guess what I
      infected that myself and the rest spread the virus did it self. Nice… I
      loved it…. Specially when the computer of the Head of Department R&amp;D
      got struck with it. Anyway the virus is still alive in my univ.</li>
    <li>On mIRC -&gt; my NicePic …. (he he he ….)</li>

<u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Beating Heuristics</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Norton AntiVirus Heuristic Analyzer (BloodHound) had given me
serious problems while I was writing my 1<sup>st</sup> ever virus a .COM
infector GHAURI. Anyway who cares about DOS nowadays.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Macros things were changed. I tried different things like
writing encryption key to a Basic’s binary file and reading it in another
variable, using log and other engineering formulas but one way or another it did
get hold of it. I started commenting all the lines one by one to see which is
the most sensitive line which I can cover. It came out to be the names of files
that I used to export and import my code to. So what I did I set the filenames
like: -</p>
<font SIZE="1">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fname$ = Chr$(58) + Chr$(92) + Chr$(119) + Chr$(105) + Chr$(110)
+ Chr$(105) + Chr$(111) + &quot;2.&quot; + Chr$(118) + Chr$(120)</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">File$ = Chr$(Asc(Chr$(Asc(Chr$(Asc(Chr$(A + 2))))))) + Fname$ +
Chr$(100)</p>
</font>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Guess what ? It worked. Just a small action and there goes all
the artificial intelligence of Mr. Norton. ;-)))))</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">At that time (somewhere in Sep 1999) I tested it with NAV 2000
to make sure it is not detected. McAfee failed badly as I think it doesn’t
have any heuristic scanning ability at all. I send the virus copy to different
people. It passed away all the channels except that of IEEE (Institute of
Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering). As their Anti-Virus got hold of it
and cleaned it on spot. I am still not sure which AV they used. Most probably
AVP because it’s not available here in Pakistan (at least 1 drawback of
Pirated software that you won’t find all the nice stuff). Otherwise maybe I
would have stepped over AVP as well.</p>

<u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">9<sup>th</sup> Bit</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nearly all of my friends know about my…… should I say hobby.
There was a software competition being held in my university. As there are
different software competitions being held in Pakistan time and again, so in
order to have a different thing they asked me to write something different. It
was 9<sup>th</sup> Bit. Thanks to &quot;Lord Julus&quot; (one of the most
versatile programmers I think !!) who helped/ guided through it.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">I made the front end in VB6 which created a complete Win32 ASM
file, compiled it and linked it in the form of a Virus infected file. Asking the
user multiple options like Payloads, user code insertion, Encryption,
Polymorphic and Metamorphic Effects (it’s effects by inserting garbage or do
nothing effect code). Giving it slight a touch of floating skulls and things
like that.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">3 judges were to come and grade each of the software. The 1<sup>st</sup>
judge gave me 88/100 (the highest the 1<sup>st</sup> day) and left saying that I
m too complicated for him. As I got the highest score, there was a lot of hue
and cry from the other programmers side as they didn’t know anything about it
themselves.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The next 2 days there were bunches of students and teachers from
different universities of the other participant approached and sort of went into
arguments. Quite often at times the Organizing committee was to be called to
control the situation.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then something went drastically wrong. The other 2 judges didn’t
know anything about ASM and didn’t understand even a single bit of what I
said. They behaved as if they were understanding everything what I was trying to
explain, but I can bet they didn’t understand even a single bit of it. Anyway
to my surprise one of them gave me 24/100 and other gave me 6/100. God Damn it!
I don’t believe it.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Anyway for those 3 days it really shudder the universities
environment and the exhibition went on fairly well…… ;-)</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unlucky for me after that I joined the Mil Academy.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">1 nice thing about 9<sup>th</sup> bit or any WIN32 ASM virus
that I noted is that u write the simplest virus and u would be the unluckiest
person in the world if ur virus get caught by AVs heuristics. They surely fail
badly in Win32 Environment.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last Macro Release in the Future</p>
</u>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nowadays I m in the Mil Academy. Most often applying mud and wet
grass on my face for camouflage and concealment. <font FACE="Wingdings">J</font>
. What to talk of using the computers. Anyway I have been learning different
things. Reading different Ezines and other stuff.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">The experience of Gahuri2 was great.</p>
<p ALIGN="LEFT">I was writing an encrypted, polymorphic virus powered by some
metamorphism when the computer crashed and all my effort went to waste. Maybe
when I’ll pass out from the academy I will rewrite it once as that I think
will be a true virus.</p>

</font></u></i>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">I was full of erroneous statements</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">On the DOS and on NT</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">My life was full of bad commands</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Not even A single access given.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">But now that you are with me</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">My heart's data type is known</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">You turn my integer pointer</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Into a character pointer.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">You download things from my memory</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Onto my new folder</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">My life was once an assembly code</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Now it's in C++</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">I love the way you program things</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">My NT server that you can fix</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">With the arrays and pointers.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">You have built a software of my life</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">I cannot survive without you</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">You are just like my mouse.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">You have programmed my life.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Increased the size and made it recursive</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">And now I'll end my poem</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Don't press Control, Alt, and Delete</p>
