     __________________________________________________________________

   Q: Tell us a bit about yourself, hobbies, music, etc.
   Music wise my likes are pretty broad, most of my CD collectoin is made
   up of Industrial music (Front242, Front Line Assembly, Skinny Puppy,
   etc), but right now I'm heavily listening to Loreena McKennitt
   who does celtic styled music, and I also love JPOP (japanese pop
   music).
   Outside of music, my hobbies are Wing Chun Kuen kungfu which I have
   been doing for 5-6 odd years now, which is my main 'hobby'.
   I'm also an avid anime/manga junkie. I have cupboards full of original
   untranslated japanese manga.
   
   Q: How did you get your handle? Is there a specific meaning behind it?
   Back in the early 80's I remember some show (an anime) which name i
   dont remember the name of, a fuedal japan setting. A Ninja used a "dark
   fiber" to strangle his enemy. It has nothing at all to do with fiber
   optic cable
   or anything like that.
   
   Q: How and when did you start out with computers?
   phew. a looong time ago. were talking back in the days when people had
   vic20's and trs-80's. i dont really remember the how but iirc, it was a
   christmas present.
   
   Q: Which programming languages do you know and which ones do you prefer
   using?
   As of right now, C, C++, VB(+VBA), SQL. I've forgotten several I used
   to know like Cobol, Lisp, etc.
   I like C for is flexibility, and SQL, its amazing what SQL can do for a
   3GL.
   
   Q: How and why did you start out with virii?
   A lot of my disks became infected with "stoned" and i became intrigued.
   My mate Australian Parasite and i were big into cracking and training
   back then (circa late 80's, 87?88?). the only viruses around were
   stoned and cascade and there was no such thing as "original" sources
   only really bad dissasemblies.
   
   Q: What (virus-)groups are you/have been a member of?
   Um thinking back, AIH, [NuKE]. Not counting partial group membership
   things and the like.
   
   Q: Are you active in other scenes, or have you been?
   Demo coding and 'utils' type scene and the OS Dev stuff.
   
   Q: Are there irl people that know of your vx 'career'?
   Yeah a few i think had some inkling.
   Which virii have you written and which ones do you like most?
   Looking back, I dont really like any of them now.
   
   Q: Have you ever released any of them in the wild? If so, how?
   Yes, on the back of McAffee's SCAN/CLEAN once or twice.
   
   Q: Were they destructive?
   Some had destructive payloads. Only 1 or 2 I think. Most were harmless.
   Are any of your virii in the wild?
   Some were wild in Australia. It wasnt something I really tracked.
   
   Q: What is your view about destructive payloads?
   I'm against it. A virus as a mechanism of destruction doesnt really
   work, since it needs to survive. If you want a destruction mechanism
   you have trojan horses and stuff for taking out someone specifics hard
   drive etc.
   
   Q: How do you name your virii?
   Very hard to pin down. I read widely, thats where i draw some stuff
   from, mostly its spur of the moment things like a word from a song or
   phrase. split second was named after the movie and jitr bugs was named
   after a new amiga virus was discovered in australia called jitrs. most
   of the time they didnt have names. there are a lot of injokes of
   course.
   
   Q: What are your favourite e-zines?
   IR had more interesting things to read (article wise). VLAD + 40Hex
   were all about source code and less about articles.
   
   Q: What are your favourite viruses and why?
   I dont really remember anymore.
   
   Q: Which persons in the scene do you respect most?
   I have not followed the scene in many years, so my answer is 'I don't'.
   
   Q: Which ones do you disrespect most?
   Aristotle+Falcon
   
   Q: What VX technique are you most interested in?
   I was most interested in polymorphic engines way back when.
   
   Q: What do you think about macro/script virii?
   They are all skillless garbage.
   
   Q: Do you have any goals VX-wise?
   no, I quit a long time ago.
   Is there any way you can be reached?
   yeah. my email address is easy to find if anyone looks.
   
   Q: Any plans in the future as a coder and in general?
   OS-Development stuff and interactive fiction.
   
   Q: Any last words/greets?
   Slash Wu (who i still see on IRC sometimes) - Keep your head above
   water!
   (he's doing service in taiwans navy...)
