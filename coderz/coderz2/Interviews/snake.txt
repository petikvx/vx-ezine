                          Interview with SnakeByte

                          Interviewer: Necronomikon
     __________________________________________________________________

   Well, tell us something about you (Age,Realname,Music,etc...)?
   I am 20, and currently studying informatics in Darmstadt ;) My
   preffered music is heavy metal, like Maiden, ACDC, Alice Copper and
   Manowar..
   How did u choose your nickname?
   After an Alice Cooper Song.
   When you entered in the computer's world?
   When I was in the second or third grade my dad brought a computer, and
   all I did was typing some letters and whatch them appear on the screen
   ;) Then he bought a new PC, i think it was a 286, and I started in
   playing games ( Pacman, Digger.. *g* ) and coding some QBasic. Hell my
   coding style was really crappy in these days.. I didn't even used loops
   or jumps ;)
   When you entered in the VX world?
   1998 i started to get interested in viruses and began to learn some dos
   assembler and coded my first viruses in batch language...
   In what languages can u code?
   VB, Dos ASM, Win32 ASM, some Qbasic, Pascal, IRC-scripting, and now I
   am learning java and perl.
   What programming language do you like using the most?
   ASM, for small apps and VB for everything else ;)
   Have you written viruses? If so which would you like to take credit
   for?
   I think Win32.Doser and Win32.RousSarcoma are the only ones worth
   talking about, the rest are just crappy DOS viruses and IRC-worms.
   How much viruses have u coded? Give us their names.
   The two above, 2 IRC-Worms ( Lucky and Click-It ), DOS-Crap ( Snake.787
   ) and some other nameless viruses for Tutorials ( Shell Script, Perl,
   Batch, Win32.. and so on )
   Are/were you a member of a VX group?
   No, I am not. Currently the only group I am in, is KryptoCrew, a german
   group dedicated to make knownledge and tutorials accessable for
   newbies. ( Oh, I was part of Kefrens, but let's talk about this another
   time *g* )
   Which viruses/coders/groups/zines do u like most?
   Hm.. hard question =)
   Virus : At the moment I like Win32.AOC from Bumblebee.
   Coders: There are lot's of talented ones : Lord Julus, Bumblebee, Benny
   and Gryjo ;)
   Groups: Same here : Codebreakers, 29a, and I think the Matrix guys do
   some good stuff
   Zines : 29a #5, because it is the newest one i got ;)
   Which individual or what group do you like/respect outside the VX
   world?
   I respect Prometheus and Anthraxx for their Linux knownledge and C
   coding skills.
   In addition to this i respect everyone with a lot of knownledge no
   matter on which
   kind of topic. It is always a honorable thing !
   What is your view on destructive payloads in viruses?
   This is another question which can't be answered in a few lines... On
   the one hand do I dislike direct destructive things, like deleting all
   files, crashing disk and so on. But on the other hand, I think
   backdoors, and spying payloads in a virus are tricky, even if they can
   cause much more damage. I mean I also coded a virus which does a DDoS
   attack, but due to the fact I don't spread viruses ( except as source )
   I don't think this will ever
   harm someone.
   Do you think there is such a thing as a 'good' virus? (Describe the
   perfect virus.)
   No, not really good. I think a virus is good for learning interesting
   techniques, facts, learning some asm and having fun while coding it,
   but that's all. It will never be a really good thingie ( but isn't that
   also a fact why
   we like coding them ? *g* ) Ehrm, the perfect virus... Hope such a
   thing will never exist. I mean, in a way it is
   like a challenge between the VX'ers, everyone tries to write a better
   virus. If one would write the "perfect" virus, I think a whole lot of
   VX'ers would stop coding, because it would be impossible to write a
   better one.
   What is your view on the continuous 'war' between VX and AV.
   I think it is more a game. I've met an AV'er from here, and if we
   didn't talk about the moral/ethical aspect, we had some fun. I mean we
   and the AV'ers share one thing : the interest in viruses ;) I think the
   most are ok, and wouldn't virus writing be boring, if there are no
   "opponents" and every computer is nevertheless infected... ;)
   If there is one good side ( we *g* ) there also must be a bad side (
   the commercialists ) one can't exist without the other ... ( Heh, I
   wrote a freeware trojan scanner, wouldn't it be strange if i would talk
   bad about them *g* )
   Have you ever confirmed one of your viruses 'in-the-wild'?
   Don't think so. Someone told me one of my IRC Worms to be in the wild,
   but I don't believe it. In a way I also hope this never happens, would
   just make trouble.
   Besides writing viruses, do u have another hobby?
   Coding =) , music, movies, hanging 'round and make party with friends,
   read some stuff from H.P. Lovecraft or E.A. Poe, collecting E-Zines,
   read them..
   Do people outside the VX scene know what you do (parents, girlfriend
   etc.)?
   Some friends know, I think my parents too, even if I never told them
   directly, my girlfriend .. nope I never told her.
   Should viruses be illegal? Is there a difference between creation and
   spreading?
   I think as it is here it is ok, you are allowed to write what you want
   to and if you spread them you get busted. For me there is a big
   difference. It is like creating a knife and using it for mass murder.
   If i am a talented iron-worker and create a really sharp knife that
   looks like a wonderful bird. Heh that's cool, I know it could be used
   for bad things and thats ok, because I would never use it. But if one
   get this knife and kill's some people, it is not my fault.
   What is your view on Windows (3.1/95/98)
   Hmm... 3.1 was stupid, because there was always the dos shell after
   booting, so I decided most of the times to work in DOS and not with
   windows. Win95 is my favourite, Win98 looks like a bunch of patches for
   Win95. NT stinks, I just hate this Dr. Watson.. ;) ME has a nice
   Backgammon Game inside thats cool, but I don't really realize any other
   ( good ) changes. 2k also seems a fake, just think about the SFP, first
   a feature now a piece of useless code...
   Tell me what do u think about the following topics
   MACROVIRUS:
   Don't really like them ( sorry Necronomikon ), because they're too easy
   and fast too code, this doesn't fit into the mystic idea of a virus i
   once had ;
   VIRUS GENERATORS:
   Nice too see some code and a nice experience to code one. But I
   everyone who uses this and thinks he wrote a virus, will never escape
   from Lamerland :P
   POLY ENGINES:
   a Headache, but useful
   DEBUG AND SOURCER:
   I prefer debug..
   TASM AND A86:
   Both are ok, as long as it is not Masm ..
   SOFTICE:
   Seems to be cool, but I still can't work with it.. ( anyone who want's
   to give me
   a course ? )
   Stealth:
   .Should be implemented in Win32 as soon as possible.. ( heh hook some
   API's and re-implement the disinfection on the fly thingie in Ring-0...
   this would shock's some AV's )
   IRC:
   .I am happy I don't have internet access ( or a phone ) in my own flat,
   because this way I have many more time for coding, I would normally
   waste on IRC.. :P ( But in a normal dosis IRC is cool )
   AV's and their software:
   At the moment they all suck. But there is light at the end of the
   tunnel.
   As far as I know they prepare an open source AV..
   I hate......
   Little kids, which drink too much and start singing stupid songs
   instead of doing some destruction.. *fg*
   I love......
   my girlfriend.
   What is your advice for people just starting out?
   Learn Assembler, read sources, read tutorials.. and then ask
   questions,.. not before ;)
   Where can you be reached if at all?
   During the week in darmstadt, on weekends in wiesbaden.. but you might
   want to drop me a mail to SnakeByte@kryptocrew.de before you visit me
   :)
