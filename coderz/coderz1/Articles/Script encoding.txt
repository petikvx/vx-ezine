   Script encoding

   09/09/2000
   Hi all.
   First, when reading this, consider that English is not my native
   language, so expect some mistakes in the text. :)
   I was going to submit my last worm for the zine, but well, instead of
   that I decided to write some things about encoded scripts
   (JScript/VBScript) and only use that worm as an example. With this I
   mean Microsoft's encoding, not other manual ways of encoding or making
   your code harder to read.
   So this is my first article for a zine, most of my viruses/worms where
   included in many, but just that, not real articles or tutorials.

   Script encoding in HTML files

   Script encoding started with Internet Explorer 5, in that time it was
   possible to use the "<script>" tag of HTML files to write scripts in
   JavaScript, JScript or VBScript, but this version added new values for
   the "language" property of that tag, those values were "JScript.Encode"
   and "VBScript.Encode".
   Examples:
   <script language="JScript.Encode">
   <script language="VBScript.Encode">
   I said that Internet Explorer 5 started this because it included
   version 5 of both JScript and VBScript, which are the ones that
   included this new feature.
   For encoding your script you need Script Encoder which is available
   from [1]http://msdn.microsoft.com/scripting. This Win32 command line
   program will read your HTML file with a script tag having "VBScript" as
   it's "language" value and it will write a new HTML file with your code
   encoded and with the "language" attribute changed to "VBScript.Encode".
   Similar thing happens when using JScript.
   For example, something like this:
   <script language="VBScript">
     MsgBox "Example"
   </script>
   Will be changed to:
   <script
   language="VBScript.Encode">#@~^GgAAAA==@#@&P~t/TAWXPr36m:2VJ@#@&7gUAAA=
   =^#~@</script>
   Have in mind that this encoding is really designed for casual readers
   of your code, the truth is that it's trivial and will not protect your
   code from people that is decided to view it.
   Of course that this things are only supported in Internet Explorer, not
   in other browsers. Script languages are not part of the HTML language,
   not even the "language" attribute is part of HTML 4, the correct
   attribute would be "type", but well, that is another matter that is not
   virus related.
   At the time of writing this I know only one virus using this feature in
   HTML files, it is HTML.Lanus which I wrote time ago. Anyway, I
   explained script encoding in HTML files to show how it was possible,
   but as we know, HTML files are not a real target for viruses since
   scripting in them needs authorization from the user when using most
   needed objects unless we are using some kind of bug to skip the warning
   message.

   Script encoding in Windows Script Host

   Windows Scripting Host 1 (also known as WSH in this text) was included
   for the first time in Windows 98. It supported JS (JScript) and VBS
   (VBScript) files to do scripting, and with this, a new type of viruses
   was started by Lord Natas. No encoding was possible.
   Time later Windows Scripting Host changed it's name to Windows Script
   Host and version 2 was out. One of the things that this new version
   added was the possibility of encoding our scripts like it was possible
   with HTML files by using two new extensions, JSE and VBE.
   JSE are JS files after using the encoder, the same happens with VBE and
   VBS.
   For using the encoder with JS and VBS files is the same as with HTML
   files, it reads a VBS file with our script and it creates a VBE file
   which has our encoded script.

   NETWORK/OUTLOOK.FakeHoax

   NETWORK/OUTLOOK.FakeHoax is an example of script encoding in Windows
   Script Host. It is the first virus/worm using the JSE and VBE extension
   (at least not as auxiliary files), so it has two versions, one in
   JScript and other in VBScript.
   It uses OUTLOOK and the network shares for spreading. The main code is
   a COM object written in XML and VBScript using Windows Script
   Component, so the code in the JSE and VBE file is trivial. Both
   versions create a WSC file (the COM object defined in XML) and then
   both call methods and change properties of that object, no real
   spreading code is in those files.
   The worm was written in this way to make it easier to port it to any
   other language, this way I was able of creating a JSE and a VBE file
   without really porting the main code. Also, it's possible to create new
   versions using Delphi, Visual C++, or any other by using "REGSVR32.EXE"
   to register the WSC file as a COM object before calling it's methods or
   changing it's properties.
   This worm was written to show how JSE and VBE files could be used in
   viruses/worms, since before this they where only used as auxiliary
   files (some versions of HTML.rahC by 1nternal and OUTLOOK.Monopoly by
   me for example). Besides, since it needs Windows Script Host 2 or
   later, it won't be good spreading itself at the time of writing this.
   Also, this was a good opportunity for using Windows Script Component
   for the first time because it made possible to write a JScript and a
   VBScript version without needing to port the whole code, so this is
   also the first virus/worm using it's own COM object.
   NETWORK/OUTLOOK.FakeHoax text file including source code:
   [2]network_outlook.fakehoax.txt.
   NETWORK/OUTLOOK.FakeHoax ZIP file (text file and working copies of the
   worm): [3]network_outlook.fakehoax.zip.

   Script encoding support

   When writing viruses you must know in which systems your code will
   work. Even that script encoding is not new, it was not a valid feature
   for viruses since not many systems supported it. But this is changing
   in this days and encoding is now possible for a worm with good
   spreading capabilities.
   Script encoding in HTML files: supported in any system with
   JScript/VBScript 5+ (included in Internet Explorer 5+).
   JSE and VBE files: supported in any system with Windows Script Host 2+
   (included in Windows 98 SE, Windows 2000 and Windows Me).
   Also, JScript/VBScript 5+ and Windows Script Host 2+ can be installed
   as separate packages. For example, an encoded script in a HTML file
   could be run in Internet Explorer 4 if JScript/VBScript 5+ separate
   package is installed.

   Trick to run JSE and VBE files in systems with WSH version 1

   By using a trick I found, JSE and VBE files can be run in systems with
   WSH version 1 instead of version 2 if JScript/VBScript 5+ is installed.
   Let's see an example, a system has Windows 98 (not Windows 98 SE) and
   Internet Explorer 5 installed. WSH 2+ separate package was not
   installed.
   So this system has WSH 1 and JScript/VBScript 5, since WSH 1 was
   included with that Windows version (unless it was not selected in a
   custom installation) and JScript/VBScript 5 was included with Internet
   Explorer 5.
   This system is able to understand encoded scripts, it just doesn't has
   the JSE and VBE extension support. So to run a JSE or VBE file we can
   create a WSH file that calls the encoded script.
   This means that instead of running a VBE file directly (not possible in
   the example), we can run a WSH file (which is supported in WSH 1) that
   runs a VBE file.
   This method was used in OUTLOOK.Monopoly, the worm was a VBS file that
   created a WSH and a VBE file and then runs the WSH file, so the main
   code was encoded and it worked in the first edition of Windows 98 with
   Internet Explorer 5 installed. WSH 2+ was not needed in this worm.
   I won't explain how WSH files work, to know more about them, create a
   JS file and then view it's properties, changing some of them will
   create a WSH file in that same directory. Then view it and play with
   those values. :)

   Other file types in which script encoding may be used

   Script encoding can be used in any file format that accepts the
   "<script>" tag. Anyway some file formats like WSC and WSF are not
   supported by the actual version of Script Encoder, but you can include
   encoding in those file types by creating the "<script>" tag in a HTML
   file and then copying the encoded code to the WSC or WSF file.
   Script Encoder recognized extensions are ASA, ASP, CDX, HTM, HTML, JS,
   SCT and VBS.

   Script encoding and viruses

   You can use this feature in HTML viruses/worms even that they are not
   something very interesting, or you may use it in worms in JSE or VBE
   format, which will be better methods.
   Normal viruses in JSE and VBE format are not interesting since it would
   be like JS and VBS viruses, there are not many files to infect since
   they are not used much by people, well, maybe you can find lot's of
   them in my computer since I'm so crazy about scripting and I use it for
   lot's of simple tasks, but most users don't use WSH. :)
   Also, encoding won't make a file simple to infect, since it would be
   necessary to decode it, infect it and then encode it again.
   This days there are a lot of worms in VBS files (not happening the same
   with JScript ones), well, all this worms could be easily encoded.
   Encoding VBS files will have two advantages:
   1) The code will be encoded, so it will be harder to read and most
   users won't do that.
   2) VBS files are a known target for worms, but VBE files are not. So
   VBE extension is far better for them.
   But there are also two disadvantages:
   1) Some old systems may not be able of running VBE files.
   2) The script will be a few bytes bigger. But they are only a few so
   this is not really a big disadvantage.

   Well, that's all, let me know in case of any error you find about
   technical things or for any question you have.
   Bye all.
