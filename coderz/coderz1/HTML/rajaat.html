First question.. Do all VXers here walk around stoned all day and bang with their heads against 
맓amp posts? &lt;G&gt;<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Well, in order to feel at home during an Amsterdam VX meeting you will have to walk the left-hand 
맗ath of stonedness. I think I'll manage to become Dutch quite well ;-)</font><br><br>
 
How old were you when you had your first experience with computers?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>My first computer was an Aquarius, an ugly little fellow with blue rubber keys. I got it for my 
막irthday when I was 7 years old.</font><br><br>
 
How old were you when you joined the VX scene?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I was just about your age when I conducted my first virus
만xperiments, just before I got 18 years old.</font><br><br>
 
How many viruses have you written by now.. any chance your totally drugged brain can still 
remember?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I cannot recall an actual number, but I think it must be around 200 or so, including minor 
맜ariants.</font><br><br>

Do you consider yourself an 'evil' or rather 'nice' VXer?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I consider myself to be a 'nice' VXer, if you can speak of such a thing. Since we are evil in the 
만yes of the end users, I frankly don't care if I appear to be friendly or not.</font><br><br>
 
Which language do you like most for writing viruses?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Hah, that's a good question. I would likr a language in which you have complete control over the 
맊ode it generates, so highly configurable languages like C-- or
Terse are good, but lack the things
맕eeded in a ring0 win32 environment. I yet have to look for a free language that comes with source
마nd generates tight code. Perl is interesting, though extremely bloated.</font><br><br>
 
Did you ever write anything destructive? If so, how do you feel about that now?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I have written one virus that did intentional damage, but after having goofed up with debug I 
맋ecided for my own good to try to make them as harmless as possible.</font><br><br>
 
What is, in your opinion, the most idiotic comment about any of your viruses you've seen, from 
ㅁVers?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I laughed a lot when I saw the description of Fick.7326 on the AVP site. I had expected that 
Kaspersky would be smart enough to recognize that major part of it is written in Borland C++, 
말nstead of Pascal.</font><br><br>
 
Do your family and friends know you write viruses?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Yes, they don't care as long as I leave their machines alone.</font><br><br>
 
What am I doing here between these weirdos? (being the only normal person around)<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I have no idea, perhaps masochism? ;-)</font><br><br>
 
Do you have enemies in the scene?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Not that I am aware of. There are people I like and there are people I don't like. These people 
I do not communicate with may want to consider themselves my enemy but that makes no difference 
맚o me.</font><br><br>
 
What do you think about infected users?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I pity them. After so many media hypes (Michelangelo, Melissa, I love you..) people should have 
맓earned the necessity of installing a good scanner from a trusted source.</font><br><br>
 
If a family member would catch one of your viruses and he/she had no AV installed at all, no 
막ackups and he/she had caught it by running an e-mail attachment, despite all the warnings on the 
Internet and elsewhere, would you help him/her out?<br><br>

<font color=808080>Yes, and immediately install a cracked version of AVP. I'd tell them they are stupid if they don't 
맒eep it updated. My hobby is writing them, not giving users a hard time. Unfortunately, a virus 
말s made to be spread, thus I give them to people who are interested.</font><br><br>
 
What's your favourite VX website?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080><a href="http://www.coderz.net">www.coderz.net</a>, it is like a portal form, just like slashdot.</font><br><br>
 
ㅁre you IRC addicted?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>No, I don't think so.</font><br><br>
 
How long are you planning to stay in the scene? (Out, out!! ;)<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I have no set plans whatsoever, but I feel like I have not tried
마ll the things I wish to accomplish.
There is so much I yet would like to try out, but this mainly has to do with compilers and 
말nterpreter issues.</font><br><br>
 
How big do you think my chances are to survive smoking a joint? (in %)<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Hmm, about 50% at first, after 20 years of smoking weed I guess that gets trimmed down to 5% :-D 
But you'll get a try..</font><br><br>
 
Can I take a picture of the cat?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>If he agrees you can try, but I had troubles myself keeping him in a pose for longer than 2 seconds.</font><br><br>

<center><img src="cat.jpg" border=0 width=294 height=221><br><br></center>
 
Which AVers do you hate most?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I don't hate them, though it is a pity they earn money on the digital havoc we wreak.</font><br><br>
 
Which of your viruses are you most proud of?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I think I'm proud of most of them. Each time I coded something I tried out new stuff, so each one 
말s a milestone in my writing (or lack thereof) skills.</font><br><br>
 
Which other viruses do you like?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I for example like Babylonia for the ideas, win32.crypto for its
맚ricks with encryption. All
말nventive virus writers have my respect.</font><br><br>
 
How important is virus writing for you and does it have any influence on your life?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>It has not such a great importance as it used to be for me, since my job consumes most time.</font><br><br>
 
ㅁre you in any other underground scene, except for VX? (hacking, phreaking..)<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>No, those things don't have my interest.</font><br><br>
 
Do you have a real life?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Not very much, it is consumed by my work most of the time, though I might buy one if I got enough 
맊ash.</font><br><br>
 
Which kind of movies and music do you like?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I like some movies like Braveheart, The Mummy, The Matrix, horror and comics. My music preference 
말s hard rock.</font><br><br>
 
Do you have any other hobbies?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>I don't have many hobbies though I like reading books and sometimes I even enjoy cooking, since I 
맕ow have to (can't live on microwave food alone).</font><br><br>
 
ㅁre you married or do you have a girlfriend?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>No.</font><br><br>
 
Do you believe in God?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Yes, for I am my own God :-)</font><br><br>
 
What's your favourite country/city?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>The place I would like to be my next holiday is Curacao.</font><br><br>
 
ㅁre you getting bored yet?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>No, hungry, where is the food in this pillage of papers?</font><br><br>
 
What's your favourite food?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Aargh! Now questions about food while I'm starving? I like pastas and chips of course.</font><br><br>
 
Do you like junk food?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>By occasion, when I don't feel like cooking.</font><br><br>
 
Which channel do you prefer, #vir or #virus, and why?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>#virus, by lack of knowledge what the other channel is for.</font><br><br>
 
What do you like most about the scene and writing viruses?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>The broad scale of different people involved.</font><br><br>
 
Is there anything else you want to mention?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Not right now, I'll mail you when I come to think of something.</font><br><br>
 
ㅁny greetings or hate messages?<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>Hate to McDonalds, for not grilling their burgers :-)</font><br><br>
 
Thanks for the interview :)<br><br>
 
<font color=808080>You're welcome, lets have dinner , Gigabyte :-)</font><br><br>
