What follows is the result of a run in I had with a seriously stupid
IRCop of Undernet. If you the reader doesn't know or understand shared
drives and net.exe, This entire file will be one boring read for you.
For the rest of us, It's funny as hell... Definatly a keeper if I do say
so myself :]

I don't have the logfile handy of my original conversation with
chaplain, nor the Logfile earlier that day this shit went down, because
I don't log from work. I turned on buffer save after CiCi made her
threat, otherwise I wouldn't have proof of that either. However, I do
have some wonderful emails; and the entire log of CiCi and myself
chatting the next day. Now then, on with the show...

<Latte> but what people tell us, they 
  say life must go on, they said that 
  to me when my wife passed away
<TremorX> The problem with that would 
  be trying to get your Mass Air 
  Sensor to register properly. I 
  suppose it COULD be done, but you'll 
  need to add at least a small section 
  of pipe where you can mount it, and 
  then you run a chance of the airflow 
  being wrong. Of course, you could 
  always acquire another stock airbox, 
  do some cutting, get some hosing and 
  try it. No harm in trying, so long 
  as your car still works if you mess 
  up!

<JnetyBabe> can anyone tell me where 
  to look in the bible......
<JnetyBabe> where it talks about 
  sucide and how it makes you go to 
  hell ?
<Raid> I think if you commit suicide 
  you'll goto hell for it, yes.
<Raid> But don't quote me on it, I 
  don't know for sure.
<patience_> it doesnt talk about 
  suicide specifically

<Raid> patience_: the bible seems to 
  have a real problem with specifics...
<patience_> not all the time
<patience_> only a few things
<Raid> a few things?
<Raid> according to the bible patience,
   how old is this planet?
<Raid> a few thousand years?
<patience_> in my opinion
<patience_> wel *i* think about 10000 
  years or so
<patience_> i'm not exactly sure
<Raid> 10,000 years eh?
<patience_> but theres no verse in the 
  bible that says " the earth is so 
  many years old"
<Raid> Geological Science says she's a 
  hell of a lot older then that.
<patience_> Raid maybe a couple 1000 
  less
<patience_> ya well 
<Raid> by a few million years or so.
* patience_ needs food
<patience_> well i dont believe that
<Raid> We know alot more now then we 
  did in the 1800s :)
<Raid> Do you believe dinosaurs roamed 
  the earth at one point?
<patience_> they could very well have
<patience_> cos they couldda gotten 
  destroyed in the flood
<Raid> could?
<Raid> ehm.. No
<Raid> they did.
<ZoOrOpA> Raid:my mother in law does
* patience_ cant debate because i dont 
  have enough knowledge
<ZoOrOpA> j/k
<ZoOrOpA> j/k
<Raid> DIdn't god claim we were the 
  first?
<patience_> you calling your motheri n 
  law a dinosaur? lol
<Raid> Well, how can we be the first 
  on this planet, if the dinosaurs 
  were here and long gone?
<ZoOrOpA> patience_"im not married...i 
  was trying to be funny
<ZoOrOpA> ;]
<Raid> adam and eve, then they furry 
  little animals...
<Raid> No mention of dinos..
<Raid> Yet, we have real evidence that 
  they existed.
<pSyk_> lol
<patience_> heh
<Raid> like there huge skeleton 
  remains, and the fuel I paid almost 
  2.00 a gallon that runs my truck.

<patience_> umm
<patience_> God created animals maybe 
  first
<pSyk_> yes he did.
<`Pegasus> hi patience :)
<pSyk_> no no
<pSyk_> read the genesis
<patience_> but we were around too i 
  reckon
<patience_> anyway
<`Pegasus> Psyk: You still here?
<pSyk_> god said he created man frist 
  than woman than animals
<Raid> patience_: What about cave men?
<patience_> we all have our own 
  opinions
<Raid> patience_: You can't claim this 
  is my opinion, Dinosaurs roamed this 
  planet.
<pSyk_> they found human remains that 
  date 40,000 years ago...

<Raid> patience_: Not moving on, I 
  like this topic.
<pSyk_> patience_ why not? have you 
  researched carbon dating techniques?
<Raid> and there isn't anything wrong 
  with this topic...
<Raid> it's legit.
<patience_> well i've heard that they 
  can be wrong
<pSyk_> patience_ do you think you are

The next Day, I begin to talk to her.. Here's that log. :)
I dub this, "The undernet funny"

<CiCi> why?
<Raid> I don't think you quiet understand what you erm, reported me for. heh
<Raid> Mr chaplain had open shared drives. I didn't do anything to him, I told him it was there; I even directed him to a website for zone alarm. (firewall; fixes that problem)
<Raid> I told him if I was a jerk as he said, I would have formatted him.
<Raid> I didn't do so. hehe
<Raid> I didn't "hack" him or anything.
<Raid> His computer isn't setup properly.
<Raid> His entire c: drive is wide open to anybody; even you.
<CiCi> ok, let me go read these logs again with that in mind, brb
<Raid> So when I'm contacted by the authorities, (they already know about this serious security problem.. ) they'll probably get a chuckle out of it. As I told chaplain he had this problem, if I was a jerk; I wouldn't have said a word.. just done mean things to him.
<Raid> thanks.
<CiCi> [13:29] (Raid): LC: So consider that a threat, lamer.[13:29] (Raid): LC: So consider that a threat, lamer.
<Raid> Are you going to use the entire log, or out of context?
<Raid> I have no need to threaten CiCi. I could have kept my mouth shut.
<Raid> then anybody (even you) could access his entire system.
<Raid> and use it like you were sitting at the keyboard.
<Raid> I thought he might like to know about it.
<Raid> Next time I find somebody has this problem... shrug, I'll just keep quiet. I had no idea you didn't know about this serious problem with windows machines.
<Raid> NT suffers from it as well.
<Raid> in fact, everytime you reboot; unless you manually set it otherwise, drive c: is shared as open, with admin rights, no password.
<Raid> listen, if you really don't believe me, You can ask anybody you trust with computer knowledge to checkout this log of our chat.
<Raid> I'm not bsing you.
<Raid> I was trying to save you some shame is all.
<Raid> (My boss thought it was funny as hell.)
<CiCi> you were trying to save me from shame?
<CiCi> heh
<Raid> erm, embarrasment rather
<Raid> it's not normal for an admin to not understand shared drives. ;p
<Raid> and you are an administrator. hehe
<CiCi> if your boss had a copy of your logs I don't think he'd think your actions were funny
<Raid> Admins are supposed to know these things, and if they don't check it out first.
<Raid> Actually, he was standing beside me the entire convo; including the one with chaplain.
<CiCi> if you were trying to help, that's one thing, but you were threatening and that's not right
<Raid> He didn't believe me when I told him YOU were an ircop of undernet.
<CiCi> if you recall, you tried that same mess on me when you first met me
<Raid> I had to /whois and show him your "is an ircop" thingie.
<Raid> Listen, I had access to his computer, why threaten? Nothing he could do at that point. he was mine for the kill if I wanted it.
<Raid> Instead, I told him he had a problem.
<Raid> and explained (which you did take out of context) that if I was a jerk, I could easily format /u his hard disk, or even quicker, nuke his fat or registry.
<CiCi> why were you looking anyway?
<Raid> oh and btw, I'm not a teenager; or a script kiddy, I don't have any reason to bs you. I'm perfectly capable of backing up what I say.
<Raid> I wasn't.
<Raid> My script autoscans people on joins, much like undernet does for open proxies.
<Raid> You might want to recommend undernet do this scan hehe
<Raid> it's even more serious to a users data then an open proxy.
<CiCi> uhm no
<CiCi> undernet isn't a nanny service
<Raid> Shrug, as I said... if you don't know about something, Check it out before accusing me of doing something bad. I've been clean for almost 8 months. Haven't hacked a single thing.
<CiCi> the only things we look for are things that damage this network on a large scale
<CiCi> the admins would NEVER agree to such scans as yours done to all guests
<Raid> if they all knew about the bug in windows, I bet you they would.
<CiCi> now, I"m tired of you insulting me
<Raid> I'm sure some of you ircops login with windows boxes.
<Raid> I'm not trying to insult you.
<Raid> Actually I find you one of the cooler ircops i've talked too.
<Raid> I realize I may sound like a smartass; But it's seriously not intentional.
<Raid> I simply want to resolve this issue with you.
<Raid> I'm not worried about the authorities.
<Raid> I just don't like people thinking I've done something i didn't is all.
<CiCi> you scanned someone's machine and then said
<CiCi> [13:29] (Raid): LC: So consider that a threat, lamer.
<Raid> My script scanned him when he joined.
<CiCi> I haven't changed my opinion of your immature behavior
<Raid> hmmm
<CiCi> if you honestly wanted to help people by doing this, you wouldn't call them lamers
<Raid> Did you get the entire log, or just what I said to him?
<CiCi> do you have any clue what percentage of our undernet guests I could call lamers?
<Raid> IE: the first thing he said to me?
<CiCi> alot of them, but I don't
<Raid> I was minding my own business, he smarted off. I decided to tell him in open channel (I was writing /msg to him) that he had a problem.
<CiCi> perhaps a lack of communication skills is the problem, I don't now, but I do know that what you did was not good
<Raid> If I was immature as you seem to think, I'd have chewed his hard disk up right before his eyes, and said nothing.
<CiCi> *shrug*
<CiCi> ahhh so he "smarted off" so you thought you'd put him in his place?  that's typically something a kid does
<Raid> a kid?
<Raid> No mam, A kid would have formatted him the second they were told an open share was found.
<Raid> or stolen data or something.
<Raid> I told him about it, and since he was being a wiseass; I told everybody in the process.
<CiCi> pftt
<CiCi> that was very nice of you...... not
<CiCi> and that's my point
<Raid> would it have been nicer not to tell him?
<Raid> so somebody WITH the intention of harm could take advantage?
<CiCi> would have been more civil if you hadn't tried to act l33t with him
<Raid> I didn't try to act l33t. 
<CiCi> and because you decided to show off and make a fool of someone, you made a mess
<Raid> I made no such mess, A misunderstanding of what exactly I did made a mess.
<Raid> Chaplain I bet didn't mention we go way back did he?
<Raid> I didn't show off, I already had the blasted privmsg typed... He decided to be a wise one... So I cancelled it, and wrote a new one.
<CiCi> alot of people can hack, most of us don't, and most of us are mature enough not to have a temper fit and announce a problem
<CiCi> enough
<Raid> Alright, fine. You don't believe me.. That's perfectly ok. All you need to do is check ANY search engine (or even micrsoft) for the fix for this problem.
<Raid> they'll even tell you it's not a hack.
<Raid> it's a bug.
<CiCi> most invasions are bugs
<Raid> erm, I didn't invade him. Script checked for open shares, didn't establish connection or map anything.
<Raid> it's no more intrusive then proxy scans. Users don't even notice it, and it doesn't show up as an attack on any firewalls either; because it isnt.
<CiCi> *sigh* I'm finished with this now, you're wrong to threaten people, end of story
<Raid> ugh... Well, checkout what I said if you get a chance.
<Raid> and goodnight n stuff.

Hi there. I thought you might like to know you have
one stupid ircop on undernet. Not only is she stupid,
but it's impossible to explain anything to her.

Her name is CiCi, and I just got klined for "hacking".
Full log follows. If you could deal with this for me,
I'd appreciate it.

Banned *@kpt-c-205-245-107-244.chartertn.net[1] until
Sat Sep 09 05:57:09PM 2000 GMT [968522229]: this is
not a playground for you to port scan and invade
other's machines .

Heres my kline (I went out to get some food, she
klined me when I left) Heres the log of all channel
activity up to my kline.
[12:25] *** Now talking in #CHristian
[12:25] -logos3- http://www.forchrist.net - channel
website, for rules and other info.
[12:25] <Raid> mornin

[12:26] <CiCi> ok everyone, when Raid's in the
channel, all your machines are going to be scanned so
be prepared
[12:27] * CiCi waits for Raid to meet her router that
doesn't appreciate script kiddie probes
[12:27] <Raid> CiCi: Actually, I've turned the script
off.
[12:28] <Raid> CiCi: I didn't want to risk having to
explain what netbios open shares are again. ;p

And heres the wonderful log last night of us chatting.
This is a long read, but it seriously shows little
intelligence on her part. Where did you get this lady?


Session Start: Fri Sep 08 23:01:35 2000
Session Ident: CiCi (~ci@fearnot.iadfw.net)
>/whois cici
CiCi is ~ci@fearnot.iadfw.net * God Can!
CiCi on #christian 
CiCi using dallas.tx.us.undernet.org www.airmail.net
CiCi is an IRC Operator
cici End of /WHOIS list.

<CiCi> why?
<Raid> I don't think you quiet understand what you
erm, reported me for. heh
<Raid> Mr chaplain had open shared drives. I didn't do
anything to him, I told him it was there; I even
directed him to a website for zone alarm. (firewall;
fixes that problem)
<Raid> I told him if I was a jerk as he said, I would
have formatted him.
<Raid> I didn't do so. hehe
<Raid> I didn't "hack" him or anything.
<Raid> His computer isn't setup properly.
<Raid> His entire c: drive is wide open to anybody;
even you.
<CiCi> ok, let me go read these logs again with that
in mind, brb
<Raid> So when I'm contacted by the authorities, (they
already know about this serious security problem.. )
they'll probably get a chuckle out of it. As I told
chaplain he had this problem, if I was a jerk; I
wouldn't have said a word.. just done mean things to
him.
<Raid> thanks.
<CiCi> [13:29] (Raid): LC: So consider that a threat,
lamer.[13:29] (Raid): LC: So consider that a threat,
lamer.
<Raid> Are you going to use the entire log, or out of
context?
<Raid> I have no need to threaten CiCi. I could have
kept my mouth shut.
<Raid> then anybody (even you) could access his entire
system.
<Raid> and use it like you were sitting at the
keyboard.
<Raid> I thought he might like to know about it.
<Raid> Next time I find somebody has this problem...
shrug, I'll just keep quiet. I had no idea you didn't
know about this serious problem with windows machines.
<Raid> NT suffers from it as well.
<Raid> in fact, everytime you reboot; unless you
manually set it otherwise, drive c: is shared as open,
with admin rights, no password.
<Raid> listen, if you really don't believe me, You can
ask anybody you trust with computer knowledge to
checkout this log of our chat.
<Raid> I'm not bsing you.
<Raid> I was trying to save you some shame is all.
<Raid> (My boss thought it was funny as hell.)
<CiCi> you were trying to save me from shame?
<CiCi> heh
<Raid> erm, embarrasment rather
<Raid> it's not normal for an admin to not understand
shared drives. ;p
<Raid> and you are an administrator. hehe
<CiCi> if your boss had a copy of your logs I don't
think he'd think your actions were funny
<Raid> Admins are supposed to know these things, and
if they don't check it out first.
<Raid> Actually, he was standing beside me the entire
convo; including the one with chaplain.
<CiCi> if you were trying to help, that's one thing,
but you were threatening and that's not right
<Raid> He didn't believe me when I told him YOU were
an ircop of undernet.
<CiCi> if you recall, you tried that same mess on me
when you first met me
<Raid> I had to /whois and show him your "is an ircop"
thingie.
<Raid> Listen, I had access to his computer, why
threaten? Nothing he could do at that point. he was
mine for the kill if I wanted it.
<Raid> Instead, I told him he had a problem.
<Raid> and explained (which you did take out of
context) that if I was a jerk, I could easily format
/u his hard disk, or even quicker, nuke his fat or
registry.
<CiCi> why were you looking anyway?
<Raid> oh and btw, I'm not a teenager; or a script
kiddy, I don't have any reason to bs you. I'm
perfectly capable of backing up what I say.
<Raid> I wasn't.
<Raid> My script autoscans people on joins, much like
undernet does for open proxies.
<Raid> You might want to recommend undernet do this
scan hehe
<Raid> it's even more serious to a users data then an
open proxy.
<CiCi> uhm no
<CiCi> undernet isn't a nanny service
<Raid> Shrug, as I said... if you don't know about
something, Check it out before accusing me of doing
something bad. I've been clean for almost 8 months.
Haven't hacked a single thing.
<CiCi> the only things we look for are things that
damage this network on a large scale
<CiCi> the admins would NEVER agree to such scans as
yours done to all guests
<Raid> if they all knew about the bug in windows, I
bet you they would.
<CiCi> now, I"m tired of you insulting me
<Raid> I'm sure some of you ircops login with windows
boxes.
<Raid> I'm not trying to insult you.
<Raid> Actually I find you one of the cooler ircops
i've talked too.
<Raid> I realize I may sound like a smartass; But it's
seriously not intentional.
<Raid> I simply want to resolve this issue with you.
<Raid> I'm not worried about the authorities.
<Raid> I just don't like people thinking I've done
something i didn't is all.
<CiCi> you scanned someone's machine and then said
<CiCi> [13:29] (Raid): LC: So consider that a threat,
lamer.
<Raid> My script scanned him when he joined.
<CiCi> I haven't changed my opinion of your immature
behavior
<Raid> hmmm
<CiCi> if you honestly wanted to help people by doing
this, you wouldn't call them lamers
<Raid> Did you get the entire log, or just what I said
to him?
<CiCi> do you have any clue what percentage of our
undernet guests I could call lamers?
<Raid> IE: the first thing he said to me?
<CiCi> alot of them, but I don't
<Raid> I was minding my own business, he smarted off.
I decided to tell him in open channel (I was writing
/msg to him) that he had a problem.
<CiCi> perhaps a lack of communication skills is the
problem, I don't now, but I do know that what you did
was not good
<Raid> If I was immature as you seem to think, I'd
have chewed his hard disk up right before his eyes,
and said nothing.
<CiCi> *shrug*
<CiCi> ahhh so he "smarted off" so you thought you'd
put him in his place?  that's typically something a
kid does
<Raid> a kid?
<Raid> No mam, A kid would have formatted him the
second they were told an open share was found.
<Raid> or stolen data or something.
<Raid> I told him about it, and since he was being a
wiseass; I told everybody in the process.
<CiCi> pftt
<CiCi> that was very nice of you...... not
<CiCi> and that's my point
<Raid> would it have been nicer not to tell him?
<Raid> so somebody WITH the intention of harm could
take advantage?
<CiCi> would have been more civil if you hadn't tried
to act l33t with him
<Raid> I didn't try to act l33t. 
<CiCi> and because you decided to show off and make a
fool of someone, you made a mess
<Raid> I made no such mess, A misunderstanding of what
exactly I did made a mess.
<Raid> Chaplain I bet didn't mention we go way back
did he?
<Raid> I didn't show off, I already had the blasted
privmsg typed... He decided to be a wise one... So I
cancelled it, and wrote a new one.

Please deal with her, I don't like being klined for
Bullshit. Thank YOu kindly.

You were removed because you were actively scanning others machines as 
they
joined the channel, invading those machines when possible, and pasting
their private chat logs back to them.  You have been asked to stop 
doing
this for over 24 hours and the requests were met with an attitude from 
you
that you were very much entitled to invade and compromise machines when
someone irritated you on Undernet. Don't think for one minute that this 
is
either legal or appreciated using Undernet bandwidth. If this is 
repeated
by you when your  gline expires, expect another one.

I told the user he had a problem, and suggested he get
Zone alarm firewall; I've got those logs too if you
should need them. I did NOT at any time access his
machine, nor map any drives to mine. I was informed he
was vulnerable; I told him.

I tried to explain this to CiCi, but she clearly
couldn't understand such a simple concept of telling
somebody they have a real serious problem.

I did NOT attack mr chaplains computer at any time,
and she didn't gline me last night. She glined me
today; She had plenty of time to gline last night.
Regardless, her gline wasn't valid. I did not use the
information that my script told me about for anything
bad, And I'd appreciate it if yuo could explain this
to her, so I don't have to deal with this BS.

Incorrect. and I have logs not only from me to prove
this, but from others present during the convo. Your
defiantly in the wrong. I did not invade ANY machines,
and i'd love to see your proof stating otherwise. I'm
sure my boss would as well. Being as he was present
during the initial conversation with Chaplain. Even he
knew about the shared drives problem on windows
machines. He did not believe me when I told him you
were an Oper on undernet; I actually had to /whois you
to show him it! My script didn't do anything harmful
to anyones machine. And I didn't do anything harmful
with the information it told me either, I informed
users they had a problem if it found one, and I
suggested they obtain Zone Alarm firewall.

Oh really? That's not exactly true, now is it. The
second I logged in today (as the log of today shows, I
've attached it to this message) you made a public
comment about me scanning people (not exactly true,
nor correct) I responded and plainly told you I had
turned the script off, because I was tired of
explaining shared drives to people. Actually, your the
first who didn't know about the problem. Since My
little run in(which I sent to abuse@undernet) with yuo
last night.  I then set away.. I was gone maybe 16
minutes.. I went to get some food at Burger king...
When I came back, YOU GLINED me. I flat out told you
the script was no longer active; YOU THEN GLINED ME
AFTER I left. Nah, I didn't do anything against
undernet policy CiCi, and you damn well know it.

> with an attitude from you that you were very much  >

Not true. You said in channel that I was hacking (I
have that log too) chaplain. You also informed me I
had been reported to the authorities; and should be
expecting a call from his lawyer soon. I'm still
waiting for that call btw.


> Don't think for one minute that this is  either

Real network aware one you are... I wasn't using
undernet bandwidth running my script...And what my
script was doing is damn sure not illegal. Unless your
going to tell me undernets proxy scans of me everytime
I connect is also illegal? I didn't do anything
different. I didn't map any of his drives to my
system. (I only knew that he had that available). I
was nice enough to tell him he had a problem.

> If this is repeated by you when your  gline expires,
> expect another one.

LOL! Fine. Expect an email with logs to
abuse@undernet.org everytime you do so. I'm not one
usually for getting glines. Nice try, CiCi.

It's obvious you have a personal problem with me,
That's fine. Still not a reason for you to abuse your
own networks policy and gline me for it Glining me
from your server would be different, but... Personal
problems can easily be resolved via ignore. Not to
mention the fellow you glined last night for swearing
in a channel you don't even op in. I've got that log
too ;p

I've also heard from others (and I'm sure they have
logs) that you've been abusing your Oline for some
time now. glining people for channel matters; Of which
you have no status in. Just because you "hangout" in a
channel doesn't give you the right to gline people
from the entire undernet; Thats what the channel has
ops for.

I carbon copied this email to Gator, I simply don't
trust you enough to send him copies of this entire
email. You quoted me out of context once already.

The log file is kinda large; scroll down for the

Then explain how you were pasting back private chat logs that Chaplain 
had
with others :/  When I first chatted with you about this, you told me 
you
wouldn't have done anything to him but because he was a smart alec, or
something of that nature, you thought you were within your right to do
this. Just because you CAN hit a child doesn't mean it's the proper 
thing
to do and most of our undernet guests are virtual children. We don't 
take
advantage of that fact.

>

I'm not Chaplain.  Get your people straight. There is more than one 
person
here who has been effected by your actions and AFAIK Chaplain isn't 
reading
this email.


>You also informed me I

I told you nothing of the sort. Once again, get your people straight. 
It is
my understanding that Chaplain has contacted his church's attorney and 
that
since you both live in the same state, there is merit for suit.  That's 
all
I know about that and that's all I want to know about it.

OK, if you weren't using undernet bandwidth, explain how you knew the
IP/host information of the people you were scanning. You were scanning
everyone that entered a channel on Undernet without their consent.  The
"consent" part is the difference between your scans and the proxy scans
Undernet does. If you read the motd of most servers, you'll see that it 
is
discussed there. If users don't want to be scanned for the most 
commonly
abused ports being open, they are free to disconnect to Undernet.  You 
made
none of this information available to people who entered the channel 
and
you had no permission from them to scan their machines.

Calling someone a lamer doesn't sound like my idea of nice and telling 
them
to "consider this a threat" doesn't sound very kind either.

I don't have a personal problem with you so the rest of the above 
paragraph
is of no concern. My problem with you was that you were sitting on 
Undernet
scanning the machines of each person joining a channel.

I was told yesterday that I had been accepted as an Op in #christian. I
have now declined that offer until this matter is settled. Once again,
scanning for open ports and then intimidating the machine owner when 
they
say something you dislike borders on extortion and it's certainly not
something I can sit by and idly watch. If you weren't on undernet, you
wouldn't know who joined the channels here.


>I carbon copied this email to Gator, I simply don't

I've carbon copied him on this as well.  Gator is a very good person 
and
does many things for Undernet that he never gets praise he deserves.  
What
you may not be aware of is that both Gator and I got copies of 
Chaplians
log files sent to abuse the day before. We both have access to the chat
long in full context. We both read email sent to abuse@undernet.org

>
>The log file is kinda large; scroll down for the
>relevant info.

Many of us who work on the net do not open attachments for obvious 
reasons.
I'm sure there is nothing malicious in your logs, but it's just a rule 
of
thumb we use to avoid problems. 

The reason I got involved in this was because you were not only 
scanning
people without permission as they entered that channel, but also 
because
you were using the information from those scans to threaten people when
they did not behave in the manner you desired.  If you have indeed 
stopped
scanning people as they enter a channel, you have solved the problem 
that
was my issue.

You care to back this up with some Evidence CiCi? Any
logs created by my machine are available for my use;
You don't have any say with that I do with material I
log. You don't own not one single file present on my
machine, and that includes logs of us chatting. I log
for a reason, and this my dear is one of them.

You can't tell me "don't be a smartass" to someone,
Sorry. It's not illegal nor against undernet policy to
treat somebody with less then perfect respect. Go
nanny somebody else.

I didn't hit anybody. And I'm getting pretty sick and
tired of your bullshit excuses CiCi. Admit it, You
don't like me, so You gline me.

respect I have for you.
 
> I told you nothing of the sort. Once again, get your

OH YES, Yes you did. I have that Log at work; I shall
retrieve it. You made it perfectly clear in your own
words that I had been reported (laugh laugh) to the
authorities for my "hacking" chaplain. 

> It is my understanding that Chaplain has contacted >

Cici, I've been as patient and forgiving as I'm going
to be. The rest of this email may be rude; I'm not
trying any longer to make it not be. Had you looked at
all on the laws governing this state; Chaplain hasn't
got a pot to piss in. However, I can and will win a
counter suit; Although I know churches don't have alot
of money, I'll counter sue for the point of it.
> OK, if you weren't using undernet bandwidth, explain

*yawn* Remember when I said I had lost my patience?
Well, get ready for a computer lesson; Seems damn time
somebody told you. It doesn't use undernet bandwidth
to /whois someone, nor does it really do anything when
you /dns somebody. My script didn't use any of your
precious bandwidth, because (oh dense one) it
establishes direct connection via a socket call. Shall
I get any more technical, or can you understand this?

Indeed I have, and guess what. If somebody really
wanted to "sue" undernet for scanning them, your motd
wouldn't do shit for you. Know why? Because it's like
a shrinkwrap software license; It won't actually hold
up in court. But it sounds good.

Technically, I didn't scan anybody. Second, I don't
actually need their permission to scan them. It's not
illegal to port scan any machine you desire. It
becomes illegal if you attempt to gain unauthorized
entry into the machine once you have scanned It.
scanning is like knocking on the door or calling
somebodys house to see if there home. For an ircop,
You really don't know much about the internet, nor the
laws gonverning it.

Still quoting me out of context? :) Why don't you
email us a copy of the entire log cici, so we can put
it in the proper context. I was nice enough to tell
him he had a problem to begin with; You seem to have a
very hard time with this very very simple concept. I
really don't know what to think of you anymore. I
already know your computer knowledge leaves much to be
desired, and in my opinion; You aren't qualified to be
an ircop.

But lucky for you, It's not in my power to make those
decisions.

> I don't have a personal problem with you so the rest
> of the above paragraph is of no concern.

I'm not letting you wiggle out of this CiCi. Glining
me went a little too far. According to the wonderful
christian log, You glined me after I had already told
you (after your attempt to start shit with me when I
joined) that the script was no longer scanning
anybody. I set away to get some food, then you glined
me. You can't get out of it. That's how it went down,
and you know it.


> My problem with you was that you were sitting on >

I'm an op in several security related channels, It is
our channels policy to scan all visitors; or they are
not welcome. My script does not currently distinquish
between only those channels and all channels I might
be visiting in. However, it is to be said; You and
Chaplain are the ONLY people I've scanned and informed
they had a problem that weren't happy to know. They
say I suppose that ignorance is bliss, but in the
computer age; this will kill you.

Your problem with me is a personal one, Otherwise you
would not have glined me yesterday; As you knew well
infact that I was no longer scanning anybody (As I had
told you). How do you defend that gline anyway CiCi?
What undernet rule at the time was I in violation of?
Please, enlighten me :)

I don't know. I was speaking with the channel
administrator; He assured me I'd have no further
problems from you. :) Whether your op status is
affected isn't my concern, I just don't want any more
hassle from you. I know you've overstepped your
authority, and you know it.

The matter can easily be settled, Don't gline me for
bullshit, and apologize for the bullshit gline you did
set on me, and I'll drop the entire issue. 

> Once again, scanning for open ports and then >

I didn't scan for open ports. Computer lesson number 2
(seems you can't learn any other way, I am forced to

attempts to connect to port 139; For Netbios
information, NOT OOB nuking. I already know this is
above you, But I'm going to explain exactly what I did
anyway; Just because it's beyond you doesn't mean
somebody else reading this email won't understand what
I'm talking about.

And again, I must ask you to provide proof that I was
intimidating anybody. Sigh, I lose more and more
respect for you with each email me thinks. I don't
extort anybody.

I've been a regular on undernet for several years.
I've never had a problem like this before. And it's
not really a problem... You had no valid reason to
gline me, and you did; And I'm going to press this
issue until it's resolved. If that means I have to
make you look like a total idiot with regard to
computers, I'll do so (mind you, it wouldn't take any
effort; These emails and the logs I have show it
without a doubt). A wrong must be righted.

CiCi, You know your gline was not legit. You know it.
I know it. Why don't you apologize for doing it? It
seems like a christian thing to do.

I've known gator for sometime, he knows some

crew...

Then why are you still quoting it out of context? I
didn't do anything illegal to Chaplain; I may have
saved him some serious downtime. I do admit tho, If I
had known I'd be in this BS for doing it, I'd have not
said not one word. In the future, I'll keep my mouth
shut. Ignorance is bliss, right? :)

A LOG file is a text file, opening it in notepad will
not infect you. Please don't force me to give you a
lesson in virus terminology. I have very good
withstanding creditials in that field. How many
"scriptkiddys" (thats what you called me once right?
;p) do you know in Rolling Stone magazine? :-)

(a) I don't need their permission. and (b) I don't
even have to tell them either beforehand or after that
I scanned them. And I don't scan people. 

> but also because you were using the information from

behave in the manner you desired.

Nice try! I didn't threaten anybody; I helped his
sorry ass out. I didn't use any of the information in
any illegal nor immoral manner. I did a christian
thing a told the bastard he had a problem. I should
have let him suffer with it. Stupidty seems to be
uncurable. 

> If you have indeed stopped
> scanning people as they enter a channel, you have
> solved the problem that was my issue.

Your "issue" isn't of any concern to me anymore. Your
gline and abuse of oline is. You glined me after I
already told you I stopped, thats just plain outright
wrong. I wasn't doing anything against undernet policy
to begin with, but to gline me after I already said I
wasn't doing it anymore is bullshit. Espicially since
you didn't gline me on entry, you said a wiseass
comment about me in open channel. When I responded I
was glined shortly there after. And I bet without a
doubt; it had nothing whatsoever to do with chaplain.
I strongly suspect you didn't like my response to your
wiseass comment. 

If theres a lesson to be learned here, it's to allow
the stupid and ignorant to remain that way; It's for
the best.

Regards,
Raid

PS: I didn't have time to enter gators email; I'm
trusting you to send him this intact... See if you can
do that. Ok?

Here's a copy of this kid's latest crap.  I've had enough of this.  
Sitting
in a channel and port scanning everyone who joins is not a good thing.
Continuing his arguement with me about it is totally stupid.

This Kid isn't a kid. As I've told you once already.
Your quiet correct; This entire arguement is stupid,
You don't know the difference between port scanning
and netbios; and you don't know a damn thing about
netbios. Your clearly not qualified for your position.

You can have enough of it all you like, I didn't port
scan anyone and I'd strongly suggest you learn what
port scanning is.

Hi Lisa,

How many times do I have to tell you I'm not a kid? :)
When will you learn this?

That log where you said I would be contacted by the
authorities has been attached. I've also forwarded an
email from you to the administration of Christian;
They were as shocked to find you had been accepted as
an Op as I was. Next time you try Bsing your way out
of something, make sure you have all your bases
covered.

You also asked in a previous email to me How I was
showing private logs between chaplain and somebody
else? I didn't read that section of the email
beforehand; I've gone back and read them. How DARE you
even accuse me of something like that? I did NOT at
any time get any logs that my computer didn't create.
And I am requesting, Nay.. Demanding you show some
proof for these outrageous claims you've made against
me.

You realize CiCi, it's a good thing from a legal/money
aspect this is IRC; Because if you were pulling this
shit in real life, I'd sue the living shit out of you.

Since I don't normally log from work, what is attached
is a buffer save. (I saved it just after you left the
channel, I figured it would come in handy).

I'm looking forward to your next installment of lies. 

Regards,
Raid

PS: I've carbon copied this email to myself For
archive purposes.

Session Start: Sat Sep 09 00:00:00 2000
[00:00] <Jubei> I don't like the appointed senate
[00:00] <gen|c0de> then it was passed to the public, where it became affectionatly known as the internet and the public made it boom
[00:00] <Jubei> Nor do I like the heavy beauracracy... but for all that it's okay
[00:00] <damrekcah> gen|c0de: it was called ARPAnet
[00:00] *** fayth (~gggr@202.77.100.113) has joined #christian
[00:00] <Vote4Bush> lan.. im just tired of the jr thing.  he's not a jr, whereas mr al gore IS
[00:00] <gen|c0de> arpa
[00:00] <gen|c0de> yea
[00:00] <gen|c0de> sorry
[00:00] <damrekcah> or DARPA.. i can't remember... darpanet i think
[00:00] *** `Paradox (Paradox@bal12.carrinter.net) has left #christian
[00:00] <gen|c0de> it was ARPAnet
[00:00] <CiCi> it was just arpa
[00:01] <gen|c0de> regardless
[00:01] <CiCi> and it didn't have a .net
[00:01] <Lanfear`> vote: how bout we just call him Bubba? ;)
[00:01] <Jubei> Though my government could certainly use reform... but then there has never been a perfect government either
[00:01] <Vote4Bush> dubya is fine with me
[00:01] <Vote4Bush> clinton is bubba
[00:01] <Lanfear`> no.. I said BUBBA ;)
[00:01] <Dovi-dude> Jubei, no, trying to say that Neo in the matrix was more like what the Jewish messiah was percieved to be, rather than what jesus was like

[00:01] <Jubei> Ah, I never saw the Matrix
[00:01] <damrekcah> one of my professors is getting millions of dollars in research funding for creating new faster networks for the military
[00:01] <Vote4Bush> i know whatcha said
[00:01] <Dovi-dude> a warleader, destined to free his people
[00:01] <damrekcah> darpa is funding him
[00:01] <gen|c0de> the military doesnt need speed
[00:01] <CiCi> ok gen I"m sure you know more than I do, I was only trained by the folks involed in arpa :)
[00:02] <Lanfear`> jubei: I don't see anything in it from you recently
[00:02] <gen|c0de> CiCi: is that why you didnt even know about netbios shares?
[00:02] <damrekcah> gen|c0de: what it is about is creating high speed wireless networks in battlezones....
[00:02] *** `Ash` (joyfull@zoom12-031.telepath.com) has left #christian
[00:02] <Jubei> Dovi> I don't think that's what the jews beleived at all.  The young hot-headed jews who want to fight maybe, but not the jewish religious authorities or scholars
[00:02] <damrekcah> that's what he's doing
[00:02] <Dovi-dude> ah, Jubei you should see it. Excellent film, raised the standards for movie sf :) 
[00:02] <gen|c0de> damrekcah: doesnt matter they cant secure it worth a shit

[00:03] <gen|c0de> but hes a good guy
[00:04] <Raid> shrug
[00:04] <damrekcah> gen|c0de: do you honestly believe that we can't secure our networks?  we have tons of phds working on this project... all of which probably know maybe *a little* bit more about computer networks than you do
[00:04] <CiCi> gen I've had enough of your crap both in private message and in this channel, I'm leaving and I hope you learn manners soon

[00:05] <damrekcah> rts: but its not connected to the outside world!!!!!!!  we aren't talking about the internet here
[00:05] <Raid> Lanfear`: careful now, she might gline you. ;p
[00:05] <gen|c0de> damrekcah: I think that the recent attacks against like the pentagon and the whitehouse where people used techniques that are wicked outdated to get access to the server proves we dont
[00:05] <Vote4Bush> is anyone doing something fun this weekend?
[00:06] <rts> Raid: indeed
[00:06] <gen|c0de> cici: ive been very respectful towards you, to the point where its almost making me sick, and Im the one who needs to learn manners?
[00:06] <rts> damrekcah: your network is in no way connected to the outside?
[00:06] <Raid> The only secure (as can be) computer is one that has NO outside connection.
[00:06] <Raid> not even a dialup one.

[00:07] <damrekcah> it can be secured

[00:07] <gen|c0de> damrekcah: do you remember when whitehouse.gov got defaced?
[00:07] <Re[D]eemd> since wireless is broadcast by radio wave......you will open yourself to all kinds of security holes
[00:08] <damrekcah> no, but whitehouse.gov isn't part of the pentagon and dod which has a lot of sensitive info
[00:08] *** logos3 sets mode: -b HARDPENIS!*@*
[00:08] <gen|c0de> that attack was VERY old ( phf exploit ) you can hardly find any computer still running it
[00:08] <gen|c0de> ok dam
[00:08] <gen|c0de> a while back DISA I believe it was got hacked
[00:08] <gen|c0de> wanna know how?
[00:08] <Dovi-dude> eventually the safest thing to do, if you need high security, would probably be to store records offline :)
[00:08] * Maverick checks out the Matrix as Messiah movie site.
[00:08] * Maverick takes the Red Pill.
[00:08] <Vote4Bush> red pill eh?
[00:08] <gen|c0de> the attacked an employee's home computer and then let him log in
[00:08] <gen|c0de> the pentagon's be hacked thousands of times
[00:09] <gen|c0de> only a few have gone public
[00:09] <damrekcah> gen|c0de the pentagon and DOD have security holes on different levels on purpose so they can catch the people

[01:49] <Bond-007> no. So he shouldn't say "Christians are losers." Its his opinion too. Personally I think we are winners because through Christ we have been saved and will live eternally for ever with the Lord and Saviour.
