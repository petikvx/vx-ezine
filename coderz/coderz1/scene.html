<p><b><i>  - Ethnographic introduction</i></b>
 
<p>
 
<p>Virus writers and all people classified globally under 
the "Vx" label are an interesting population to observe. 
Especially if you can have a look from the inside, and, at 
the same time, if you're not involved enough, in order to be 
able to see the "scene" from an independant and exterior 
point of view. I think i qualify here. I'm around since a few 
years, met some coders in real life, wrote some viruses, 
but at the same time i was never member of any group, 
i'm old enough to be able, i hope, to think with some 
distance, and these last monthes i basically had better 
things to do than to write code. 
 
<p>
 
<p><b><i>  - Don't ask "How much time you spend on 
IRC?", but ask "Show me your code!"</i></b>
 
<p>
 
<p>The main problem of the "scene" can be spelled in 
three letters: IRC. I'm impressed to see how people spend 
so much time chatting about everything except virus 
coding techniques. They think that to be a real virus 
writer, you need to be accepted in some virus channel, 
and then spend twelve hours a day there. High dosis of 
IRC induces a sort of twist in reality perception, because 
people behave there very differently from real life. How 
many people we saw, and we will see, very proud of their 
brand new op, kicking, banning, laughing about infected 
users, acting as some powerful agressive elite. Even if 
they never produced one single line of code. Even if they 
never did anything useful for the Vx community. Even if 
their only production is a twenty line macro-virus. Even if 
they have to go to school the day after, where they will not 
be "DarkLordz" or "KillerGod" anymore, but normal 
average teens who have to do their homework. If you think 
you're a mature person, and i guess most of us are, 
behave as a mature person even on IRC.
 
<p>
 
<p>You may think i exagerate when i talk about this twist 
of reality. Unfortunately, i can cite lots of examples. Let's 
take one that everybody heard about. This coder, no need 
to tell his nickname, according to his own words, sent 
logs to some anti-virus people showing that another coder 
was actively spreading viruses, to "protect one or two 
channels from being deleted by Undernet". Basically, that 
means that the existence of IRC channels is more 
important that a real person's life. Because, unfortunately, 
nowadays, spreading viruses can lead directly to some 
years in jail, depending on the laws in your country. 
Which means a destroyed life. Just to "save a channel". 
You see the twist. I'm pretty sure now the guy in question 
recognizes the big error he made, and i hope he learnt 
from that, but anyway, it's too late.  
 
<p>
 
<p>This example was of course a bit unique in his 
importance. But it's typical of a state of mind very 
widespread in the Vx community. People think an op is 
the most important thing in life. They thing their rank level 
in the channel's bot is the only important thing, 
proportional to their eliteness. Twist again. Importantly, 
this changes the communication and the behaviour 
between people. Who is going to criticize the owners of 
their favourite channels? Or more generally, people with a 
higher level? This leads to hypocrisy, which is very 
widespread in the community.
 
<p>
 
<p>I saw too much examples of guys and girls spending 
so much time on IRC that everything that happened there, 
even the most anecdotical fights, was taking a huge 
importance. Let me tell you: if you need a computer and 
to be connected to feel human emotions like pain, 
angryness, friendship or love, there is something wrong. 
Really. 
 
<p>
 
<p>IRC has another problem. It's dangerous. It seems 
that Vx people never learnt the lessons from the Melissa 
case. They don't care about encryption, they don't care 
about remailers, they don't care what they say on-line can 
be used to profile or trace themselves or, even more 
importantly, some of their friends. They keep megabytes of
sensitive IRC logs and old mails. They just don't care 
until the worst happens. Virus writing and spreading is no 
more a funny game. It's a dangerous criminal activity, and 
you have to take this fact in account, especially if you 
spread your viruses, or have friends who do that. This 
is the main revolution in Vx Land these recent years. Now 
they are seriously after us. And nobody cares.
 
<p>
 
<p><b><i>  - Vxers as crickets</i></b>
 
<p>
 
Let's talk about another interesting behaviour in the Vx 
scene: the flocking in groups. That's funny how people 
who repeat so often that they are independant, or think 
different, do all their possible to integrate or create some 
clan with similar people, and then be proudly tagged as a 
member of a larger entity known as a Vx group, with its 
own set of new rules and laws they have to conform to. 
Like sheeps. The analogy is not here just as a cheap 
provocation. It's a very old animal behaviour. Individuals 
are weak; if they flock, they are stronger against all 
possible ennemies. Or at least they feel stronger. Crickets 
are a good example. Whenever they form a very large group, their behaviour 
changes completely and they become much more agressive. 
They are no more afraid of predators. It's very funny 
to see the same kind of basical animal regression in 
Vx crowds.
 
<p>
 
<p>Or maybe it's just to get some form of 
reconnaissance. People with no skill, or people afraid to 
learn (because we were all lamers at day zero, we should 
not forget that) know that they will never be accepted in 
the community for their own merits. So they need a sort of 
official tag to prove to others and maybe even more to 
themselves that they are part of Vx scene. This mark is 
provided by the membership in some group, which provide 
easily and quickly an official entrance ticket into the 
scene. No need to produce anything useful, now. You are 
already inside the community, even by a totally artificial 
way.
 
<p>
 
<p>Here again, examples are numerous. Was it one year 
ago that a new mainly english-based group appeared, 
totally over-hyped, with every newcomer wanting to 
integrate? They did nothing, most of their members were 
just plain unknown, but you couldn't miss their presence 
on IRC. Everybody laughed at them, but nobody told them 
directly that they were totally ridiculous, for example with 
their "public relation department" (more on that later), 
and other really laughable things. Yet, again, IRC was the 
main "scene" participation. Where is the code? I think now 
this group returned to the dust it appeared from, but who 
really cares? I remember too these ridiculous but finally 
rewarded ass-licking efforts by a coder (who is a cool and 
very intelligent guy, but anyway) to integrate a high-profile 
group. Once he was at last able to glue this well-known 
tag to his nickname, he reached his goal, and just 
disappeared. He never coded anything else.
 
<p>
 
<p>People sometimes tell me: "being member of a group 
is a good way to motivate". If you need to be motivated or 
gently forced to be a vxer, it should be a better idea to 
spend your time fishing, or doing something you don't 
need to be motivated for. Forget for a moment the question 
"how to be a vxer" (and basically, if you still don't know 
the answer, it's time to return to your stamp collection), 
but ask yourself the more important question: why do you 
want to be a Vxer? For the hype? Because it's cool? Because 
people will fear you? Because you want to satisfy your
ego? Because your want to impress your girlfriend or your 
mom? Because you're looking for on-line friends? Or just 
because you are curious, you want to code and learn some 
new knowledge?
 
<p>
 
<p><b><i>  - I'm soooo afraid to talk with normal 
people!</i></b>
 
<p>
 
<p>Another strong critic and clear sign of immaturity that 
comes to mind. Most of the Vxer are not able to argument 
with people from the two other sides of the virus triangle: 
anti-virus people and infected users. There is a good place 
for that: alt.comp.virus on Usenet. A mainly anti-virus group 
nowadays, unfortunately, with some non-interesting parrots, 
but anyway, the only place where you can directly and publically 
discuss with members of the anti-virus industry. They have their 
share of big hypocrisy, ego, closed mind, of course, but i'm 
not talking about them right now. These guys, and some of 
them are very smart, have a lot of tough arguments to 
oppose to us. The easy way, used by most of Vx people, 
is not to participate in this group, and avoid any kind 
of discussion. Or just to pop up here once, insult 
everybody, and jump back to their hole. What does it 
mean? Easy: virus writers are not enough open-minded to 
quietly discuss with people opposing them, listen and
contradict some opposite argumentation. Or maybe they are not 
smart and mature enough to engage in an adult discussion. 
It is kind of funny because Vx often ask for people to 
be open-minded about virus writing activities. Instead of 
bashing the largely beloved Nick Fitzgerald on IRC, where 
he is not, what about trying to argue against him publically
in the newsgroup? Of course, it may be a bit tougher, due 
to his rhetorical skills.

<p>
 
Some vx people told me that they don't participate in this
forum because it's a mainly AV group. Think a bit more 
about this argumentation. It's kind of recursive, a bit like
an infinite loop, to use coding terms. It looks like an 
auto-realizing prophecy. In other words, it's plain stupid.
<p>
 
<p><b><i>  - Ego scene</i></b>
 
<p>
 
<p>I could talk more about the grossly over-inflated ego of 
most of us (me included), but my hour of reflexion is over. 
Anyway, just as an example, i always find funny the 
dramatic and emphatic farewells from people leaving the 
"scene", although they generally never produced anything 
noticeable, texts apparently always written with some 
emotion. If you want to leave, just disappear silently and 
return to where you came from, nobody will notice 
anyway, keep contacts if you want, and don't bother 
people with your ridiculous tears in the eyes and other 
"official" retirement. The day you decided to become a vxer, 
you didn't issue a public statement "People, listen to me, 
today i officially join the vx scene!". So, do the same when 
you leave. Every other way to stop is just a desesperate and 
childish call for attention, from people who didn't receive 
enough of it for their production during their career, an 
ultimate try to turn people eyes in their direction for one 
or two minutes. This impression is even worsened when the
guy gives, as a reason, "there is too much shit in the scene
these days", or something like that. That clearly means that
they were not here to code and to learn. They probably needed 
to be accepted in whatever community to find some other people 
to talk with. What about the Barbie doll collector scene? Now 
i think about it, the utimate case of lameness is the guy who 
declares everywhere that he quits, and is actually still 
around. Not even able to follow his own words.
 
<p>
 
<p>Another example, linked with the group problem. It 
seems that some people create a group for the only 
excitement to become a boss, to be able to recruit 
people, command them, and fire them if needed. People 
always need to find other people even more lame than 
them to enhance themselves, it's an eternal law of the 
human beings. Same mechanism of false and artificial 
feeling of power than in IRC. It's "my" group, "my" board, 
"my" zine, "my" channel, and there i am the king. More 
generally, a rigid hierarchy in a group is a clear signal 
of lameness. Newcomers, please notice how the best groups 
around have no hierarchy at all. Maybe one guy who 
centralizes the material for the zine, and that's all. 
Every attempt to mimick the real world (a company for 
example, with different departments) is condamned to be 
considered as extremely lame and poorly productive; and 
i don't even talk about the irony to see newcomers in the 
underground trying very quickly to imitate the mechanisms 
of the normal world. Didn't you come in the vx world in part
because it looked different?
 
<p>
 
That's why everybody laugh when a group creates this peak of 
extreme ridiculousness, a "Public Relation" department. It's 
clearly a way to admit "we have nothing to say, but anyway, 
there is a guy in charge of that". It's a way to show to 
everybody your nombrilist and egocentric view of the scene, 
because you think every journalist around is going to be 
interested by your new group, you will be submerged by interview 
requests, users will ask you about your viruses, you will do the 
first page of the New York Times. In your dreams. 

<p>
 
<p><b><i>  - Delicate conclusion</i></b>
 
<p>
 
<p>I sometimes think that the Vx scene is mainly 
composed by boring IRC teens, who don't really know 
what life (i mean the real life) is all about, who are not 
interested in learning, but in posing as some elite lordz of 
Darkness. It may be partially true, or partially wrong, 
depends on how you look at it. Anyway, i don't really 
care. A minority of people are interesting enough, as 
human beings, or coders, or both, and that's the only 
important thing, at least for me. I don't care about 
all the microscopic IRC wars, the anecdotic group fights, 
the childish agressivity. Maybe that's because i'm a bit 
old, but i think i've learned how to filter important 
things from the background noise. And not just in Vx world.
Try to do the same, you will see, life is easier.
 
<p>
 
<p><b><i>  - Epilogue</i></b>
 
<p>
 
<p>People involved in the virus community - i don't like 
the word "scene", this is not a theater, and there is 
nobody looking at us, another nombrilist deformation of 
reality, even in the terms used - always say that it's 
worsening with the years passing. More and more script 
kiddies and less and less die-hard asm coders who can 
spend six hours on a routine just to optimize it by saving 
two bytes. I don't think it's true. The problem being that 
people cannot separate their personal history from the 
global picture (that's not limited to the Vx world, of 
course). If you try to look at it with some distance, you 
will see that the vx community looks the same than five or 
ten years ago. Not in term of techniques used, of course, 
but in term of personalities. New people pops in, old 
people quit, as an eternal cycle. In these two extreme 
populations, and in the large group of active vxers which 
sits in the middle, the proportion between posers who are 
just driven by an ego trip (ph33r M3!), and the really 
interesting guys who want to discover new techniques or 
possibilities, even through a long learning process, yes, 
this proportion stays always the same through the years. 
You have stupid old schoolers and stupid newbies who 
think they are Elvis, and you have interesting old 
schoolers and interesting newbies who want to learn, 
always. If you're reading this and you think you are 
part of the "scene", just think about in which category 
you fit best. But be aware that the image you have of 
yourself may not be the image that your Vxers colleagues 
have of you. If you're not satisfied with it, think about 
what you can do to change it and maybe to gain some respect. 
I'm not talking just about just improving your technical 
skills. Some people try to be creative with their limited 
knowledge (me, for example), other run websites, publish 
useful databases, are active collectors, help newcomers 
by writing tutorials, code other things than pure viruses, 
whatever. You can, at last, ameliorate your behaviour when 
interacting with other people. In other words: try to be 
mature.
 
<p>
 
<p>I will terminate here and return in my cave. Hope this 
helps.
