   First week of August, quite sunny, boring IRC channels.. the ideal
   moment for the yearly VX meeting. While AVers were probably thinking
   all VXers were sitting in their rooms, with a computer, avoiding the
   sun and giving dumb users a hard time by writing new viruses, some of
   us were in fact having a great time in Brno, Czech Republic, getting
   drunk, stoned, even getting some suntan and sticking 'GriYosoft' papers
   all over the city. If we still remember anything? I sure do! Lets see
   what the guys have to say..
   Did you enjoy the meeting?
   GriYo: Oh, if... I always enjoy in all the meetings that we organize in
   summer.
   I always find there great dudes ( and dudettes :-P ) and also new
   places, so i can get my hands out of the keyboard for some days.
   Benny: ABSOLUTELY YES!!! I can say it was one of the best timez in this
   year... you dont think so?
   mort: sure, i met ppl who i've seen only on chat
   Ratter: of course. it was my first VX meeting in my life and i met
   great ppl there which i knew only on Internet. It was a great time for
   me. One of the best in my life...
   Did there happen anything funny that you remember?
   GriYo: I had fun one day we went to a big park in Brno... I had brought
   a little bit of hashish from Spain, and we were smoking... We don't
   take in beginning to say foolishness and to laugh without stopping, it
   was really funny.
   Benny: Yeah, sure. GriYosoft action. all city was full of posters :)
   and i will never forget how you, GigaByte, got absolutely stoned and
   drunk, hehe.
   mort: yea,... giga and beer :)
   Ratter: yeah of course :) talking with you Gig XD
   Anything you missed there?
   GriYo: Mmmmm... no.
   Benny: Yeah, I expected there will come more ppl from foreign
   countries. nevertheless, it was really very kewl meeting, I had really
   fun.
   mort: more ppl
   Ratter: yeah i missed darkman there. and other ppl that do VXing
   How often did you have a hangover?
   GriYo: Well, we had a hangover every morning... I thought that i was
   accustomed to drink a lot of beer, but I was wrong, eh Benny? ;-))))
   Benny: almost every morning...:P but three or four beerz in the morning
   helped me a lot to forget :)
   mort: hehe,... no comment
   Ratter: I don't have hangover after weed :) and i didn't drink a lot
