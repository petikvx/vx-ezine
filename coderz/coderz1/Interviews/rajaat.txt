                       Real Time Interview with Rajaat

                            Interviewer: Gigabyte
     __________________________________________________________________

   First question.. Do all VXers here walk around stoned all day and bang
   with their heads against lamp posts?
   
   A: Well, in order to feel at home during an Amsterdam VX meeting you will
   have to walk the left-hand path of stonedness. I think I'll manage to
   become Dutch quite well ;-)
   
   Q: How old were you when you had your first experience with computers?
   My first computer was an Aquarius, an ugly little fellow with blue
   rubber keys. I got it for my birthday when I was 7 years old.
   
   Q: How old were you when you joined the VX scene?
   I was just about your age when I conducted my first virus experiments,
   just before I got 18 years old.
   
   Q: How many viruses have you written by now.. any chance your totally
   drugged brain can still remember?
   I cannot recall an actual number, but I think it must be around 200 or
   so, including minor variants.
   
   Q: Do you consider yourself an 'evil' or rather 'nice' VXer?
   I consider myself to be a 'nice' VXer, if you can speak of such a
   thing. Since we are evil in the eyes of the end users, I frankly don't
   care if I appear to be friendly or not.
   
   Q: Which language do you like most for writing viruses?
   Hah, that's a good question. I would likr a language in which you have
   complete control over the code it generates, so highly configurable
   languages like C-- or Terse are good, but lack the things needed in a
   ring0 win32 environment. I yet have to look for a free language that
   comes with source and generates tight code. Perl is interesting,
   though extremely bloated.
   
   
   Q: Did you ever write anything destructive? If so, how do you feel about
   that now?
   I have written one virus that did intentional damage, but after having
   goofed up with debug I decided for my own good to try to make them as
   harmless as possible.
   
   Q: What is, in your opinion, the most idiotic comment about any of your
   viruses you've seen, from AVers?
   I laughed a lot when I saw the description of Fick.7326 on the AVP
   site. I had expected that Kaspersky would be smart enough to recognize
   that major part of it is written in Borland C++, instead of Pascal.
   
   Q: Do your family and friends know you write viruses?
   Yes, they don't care as long as I leave their machines alone.
   
   Q: What am I doing here between these weirdos? (being the only normal
   person around)
   I have no idea, perhaps masochism? ;-)
   
   Q: Do you have enemies in the scene?
   Not that I am aware of. There are people I like and there are people I
   don't like. These people I do not communicate with may want to
   consider themselves my enemy but that makes no difference to me.
   
   Q: What do you think about infected users?
   I pity them. After so many media hypes (Michelangelo, Melissa, I love
   you..) people should have learned the necessity of installing a good
   scanner from a trusted source.
   
   Q: If a family member would catch one of your viruses and he/she had no
   AV installed at all, no backups and he/she had caught it by running an
   e-mail attachment, despite all the warnings on the Internet and
   elsewhere, would you help him/her out?
   Yes, and immediately install a cracked version of AVP. I'd tell them
   they are stupid if they don't keep it updated. My hobby is writing
   them, not giving users a hard time. Unfortunately, a virus is made to
   be spread, thus I give them to people who are interested.
   
   Q: What's your favourite VX website?
   [1]www.coderz.net, it is like a portal form, just like slashdot.
   
   Q: Are you IRC addicted?
   No, I don't think so.
   
   Q: How long are you planning to stay in the scene? (Out, out!! ;)
   I have no set plans whatsoever, but I feel like I have not tried all
   the things I wish to accomplish. There is so much I yet would like to
   try out, but this mainly has to do with compilers and interpreter
   issues.
   
   Q: How big do you think my chances are to survive smoking a joint? (in %)
   Hmm, about 50% at first, after 20 years of smoking weed I guess that
   gets trimmed down to 5% :-D But you'll get a try..
   
   Q: Can I take a picture of the cat?
   If he agrees you can try, but I had troubles myself keeping him in a
   pose for longer than 2 seconds.

   Q: Which AVers do you hate most?
   I don't hate them, though it is a pity they earn money on the digital
   havoc we wreak.
   
   Q: Which of your viruses are you most proud of?
   I think I'm proud of most of them. Each time I coded something I tried
   out new stuff, so each one is a milestone in my writing (or lack
   thereof) skills.
   
   Q: Which other viruses do you like?
   I for example like Babylonia for the ideas, win32.crypto for its
   tricks with encryption. All inventive virus writers have my respect.
   
   Q: How important is virus writing for you and does it have any influence
   on your life?
   It has not such a great importance as it used to be for me, since my
   job consumes most time.
   
   Q: Are you in any other underground scene, except for VX? (hacking,
   phreaking..)
   No, those things don't have my interest.
   
   Q: Do you have a real life?
   Not very much, it is consumed by my work most of the time, though I
   might buy one if I got enough cash.
   
   Q: Which kind of movies and music do you like?
   I like some movies like Braveheart, The Mummy, The Matrix, horror and
   comics. My music preference is hard rock.
   
   Q: Do you have any other hobbies?
   I don't have many hobbies though I like reading books and sometimes I
   even enjoy cooking, since I now have to (can't live on microwave food
   alone).
   
   Q: Are you married or do you have a girlfriend?
   No.
   
   Q: Do you believe in God?
   Yes, for I am my own God :-)
   
   Q: What's your favourite country/city?
   The place I would like to be my next holiday is Curacao.
   
   Q: Are you getting bored yet?
   No, hungry, where is the food in this pillage of papers?
   
   Q: What's your favourite food?
   Aargh! Now questions about food while I'm starving? I like pastas and
   chips of course.
   
   Q: Do you like junk food?
   By occasion, when I don't feel like cooking.
   
   Q: Which channel do you prefer, #vir or #virus, and why?
   #virus, by lack of knowledge what the other channel is for.
   
   Q: What do you like most about the scene and writing viruses?
   The broad scale of different people involved.
   
   Q: Is there anything else you want to mention?
   Not right now, I'll mail you when I come to think of something.
   
   Q: Any greetings or hate messages?
   Hate to McDonalds, for not grilling their burgers :-)
   
   Q: Thanks for the interview :)
   You're welcome, lets have dinner , Gigabyte :-)
