	Lord, help me keep my big mouth shut until I know what I am
	 talking about.

	Knowledge is Power.

	The Soul Is In The Software.

	If we are here to help others, I often wonder what others are 
         here for.

	Wisdom is knowing how ignorant we are and keeping the knowledge
	 to ourselves.

	People don't plan to fail, they just fail to plan.

	Most of us will get what we deserve, but only the succesfull will
	 admit it.

	You can run into debt, but you can only crawl out of it.

	Don't plant more garden than your wife can weed.

	Keep your mouth shut but your ears open.

	Practise makes perfect.

	Do as I say, not as I do.

	Give a fool (or John) enough rope and he will hang himself.

	To Die or not to Live; That's the Question.

	Don't Repeat a mistake: there are so many new ones to make.

	Today is the tomorrow wich you expected so much yesterday.

	Fools build houses and wise men live in them.

	No news is good news: Kill the messenger.

	One man's meat is another man's poison.

	What's worth doing at all is worth doing well.

	We won't kill but worry will.

	Of all things you wear, your expression is the most important.
