 [Cyborg Interrupts]
 Oh,no, he is searching for a [HACKING HELL: GET LOST CYBORG, WHAT'S WRONG
                                             ABOUT A FEMALE IN OUR GROUP?!?]

 [HACKING HELL BACK AGAIN]

Cyborg, please stop discriminating the female race! Cyborg, don't touch this
 keyboard! It's mine! Mine! Mine! Let me go!!!! BANG! That was my shotgun...
 Shit, missed! Cyborg, next time you touch me, I will destroy you, I
 programmed you, I can also eliminate you!

 [Cyborg Interrupts again.]

  Well, One: I did not discriminate anyone, and TWO, you cannot fight a Cyborg,
   You may have programmed me, but you do not control me and you never will.
   DataBank Reports:" To Control: to have the power to destroy."
   Now, for you know that, you might proceed, if you know the magic word:
   Ah, ah, ah, you didn't say the magic word, ah, ah, ah,......NO CARRIER

 [HACKING HELL BACK AGAIN]
WATCH ME! I will destroy you in a jiffy! And now for real: No Carrier...
