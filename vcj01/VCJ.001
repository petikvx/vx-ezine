  Welcome to the first issue of ûirogen's Code Journal!
  This zine is intended merely to distribute new code and
  ideas in an efficient manner around the computer virus
  scene. Personally, I wasn't satisfied with existing zines
  in that they were too concerned with popularity and strayed
  from their original intent. All that I have read lose their
  enthusiasm after a couple of issue and become boring and
  redundant.

  Ofcourse, there was also the influence of my irregularity
  in coding. I wanted to publish some code in nice and neat
  zine but there's no way in hell I can meet any deadline or
  wait to release any code which I complete. So, now I
  have control to handle my own laziness and irresponsibility,
  of which there is an abundance.

  This zine isn't only for my shit (no doubt that'd get quite
  boring after a while), but for any liviing thing on this
  planet which wishes to contribute code and/or ariticles. I'll
  put anything I get in here. Yes, anything; no social
  inequalities here.

  Alright, time to get to the first issue. In this issue I fuck
  invircible v6.02 some, release the source code to ûiCE v0.5,
  and much more code. This particular issue, I haven't done
  much ranting and raving, although you can be sure to see such
  in the future.

  Hopefully you'll find this issue of interest, and hopefully
  everything contained will be nice and accurate. However,
  should you find this zine objectionable, then fuck off.


                                        Sincerly,
                                        ûirogen
