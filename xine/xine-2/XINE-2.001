A short word from b0z0
----------------------
 After a long time from the first issue we are bringing finally the
second issue of the zine. Many things changed in this period, expecially
in the last month and in the last days before this release, so we have
been forced to finish the zine in a great hurry and put it out into
your hands.
 Due to this unpredictable last month facts we had to include also some
articles that may have needed another revision from the author (sorry
Beol for not waiting for the real final version) and we didn't included
the zine reader as it was initially planned (sorry a ton Dandler, but
some things are sometime bigger as someone may suppose... i hope you will
understand). I would like to say a huge "THANX" to all the guys that in
some way helped us so we are now able to bring the second issue of the
zine (again special thanx to Dandler for writing the zine reader that
hasn't been included for time probs :( ).
 And now some words 'bout the contents of the zine... In this issue we are
bringing some new techs, tricks, progs and viriis. This issue is more virus
oriented, since there are a lot of things to say about Windoze and such
like in this period :) The user level residency (no more VXD hipes) for
all kinds of Windows (tested and approved under Win 3.11 and Win95)
will without any doubt give a new look to the Windows virii concepts
in the future. A new generation of viruses that will be able to spread
over networks is likely to come soon. As you may read further we are
also bringing the world first Win virus with the capability to send
itself over TCP/IP network. Infact Homer will send itself in the incoming
directory via ftp of all the sites that the user will try to resolve
the name. Well both concepts are currently applied in the Homer virus,
which is written in C, and must be of course optimized and implemented
better. Homer actually runs perfectly on Win3.11 and Win95, but the virus
can actually infect only NExes. Again due to time problems and such like,
PE infection hasn't been included. But hey, this is just the start,
now YOU must go on and code other Win/Net virii ! :)
 There is also a lot of other great material in the zine. Of course Win95
virusing is the focus of Xine#2. We have also many material about Win95
infection (as for example the Header infector) and Win95 programming.
Of course since DOS is still one of the most used operating systems we
are bringing also new tricks and great viruses exclusive for the DOS platform.
Another great news for Xine#2 is the joining of Beol, an Amiga expert,
that will teach us a lot about Amigas! The hacking part in this issue isn't
so big... Well, that will be for antoher issue ;)
 Well you will see yourself what's up in the zine :) Since the zine was
assembled in about 5 hours (including this editorial, all the fast
corrections and so on...) please don't care too much if you see horrendous
english errors or something. As i said some of us are currently in a not
very cool situation and we can't currently work on Xine#2 anymore. Since
many of the things that are included in the zine would became old if we
had released it later we decided to release it now also if some things
may be done better.
 As for the future... it is very difficoult to say what we will do in the
future... we will see what will succeed... very probably we will came back
continuing with iKx and Xine or we may be forced to change a little the
group and so on... i really don't know, we will see... but i'm sure that
in a way or in another we will continue our project to teach all the ppl
the real power and real threaths of virusing, hacking and so on...
 so keep you eye on us ... :)
