Short addendum to Injector docs and description
-----------------------------------------------
 In Xine #1 we presented to the reader the program Injector, which is
a program for "injecting" (this is sending) packets on an ethernet and
monitoring the ethernet traffic (it has a lot of customizable options
and so on, give a look to issue #1 if you don't remember of it).
 Unfortunately there aren't a lot of guys that actually have a local
network attached to internet so Injector may not be fully used by a lot
of persons. This was one of the complains we received about Injector.
 Anyway if you even don't have a DOS PC connected into an ethernet you can
use Injector to inject packets using your PPP account at the provider. Of
course logically you won't be able at all to see the packet in his network,
but at least you'll be able to "inject" packets.
 To be able to do this you will need a PPP Packet Driver. I think that there
are many of those around, just give a good search throught the network. I
personally tried and tested (with success) the PPP Packet Driver from the
Merit Network Inc. which is free for non profit use. I saw it on many sites
(simtel also) named something like etherppp.zip. Well search it yourself :)
 Once you got it you must just configure a few things (such as the login
script for the provider and so on...) and once the connection has been
succesfull (as for the PPP i tried it will just go resident and leave you
to do whatever you want) you can now just run Injector and enjoy! Of course
as i already said you won't be able to use it as a sniffer (if you don't
understand why just leave Injector ;) ) but you'll now be able to send any
kind of packet you want (of course you must pay attention to the provider's
restrictions, I mean there could be a firewall or simply a router dropping
some types of packets).
 As for bugs: there is a very stupid bug in the version that was shipped
with the Xine #1 :( A "==" is used instead of a "!=", so raw logging doesn't
work at all :(( Very sorry, but too many work places may bring to this kind
of errors.
 Hope this hint will make you enjoy injecting packets ;)
