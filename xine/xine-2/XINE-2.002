 A big part of material that is contained in this zine may result
dangerous and may cause harm if incorrectly used. So, PLEASE, consider
this before using this material in any way. If you don't know what may
this material cause to your or to others data please just IGNORE it.
 We don't condone spreading of viruses or denial of service attacks or
something like. We write this kind of articles and this type of programs
just for fun, to enjoy in learning and to provide to other guys with the
same our interests new info. No lame (or 3l1t3 as someone may say :) )
destruction payloads are present in our viruses.
 So, again, if your intentions are to cause harm or something like please
leave our zine.

Virus Executables Disclaimer
----------------------------
 There are also some already compiled viruses in this package. To
avoid the possibility of somebody getting infected by accident we
packed all the viruses in a password protected ZIP. The password is
"thatsok" (of course without the quotes). If you don't know how to handle
these viruses or you don't know what they may do to your and your friend's
computer please DON'T EVEN TRY to open the ZIP file. Even if NO intentional
damage is done by the viruses included in the ZIP, if you aren't skilled
with virus techs you may find yourself in a very bad situation if you
get infected with the viruses, since many of them are quite infectious and
many are totally (or partially) unscannable by current antivirus software.
With the poly ones you won't even be able to set a customized scan string.
 --> SO PLEASE PAY ATTENTION! <--

Language Disclaimer
-------------------
 We are not all from a country where the first language is English, so
please try to be a little comprensive when you find huge grammatical
errors in our zine (at least i hope that the FILE_ID.DIZ in this issue
will be correct ;)) ). Of course we will try to write in a good English
but we hope that we wouldn't come out with 3l33+ +}{r453 l1|<3 +}{15 ;)))
Since this zine has been finished in a great hurry please associate all
the errors to this fact ;))))
