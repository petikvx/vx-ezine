News and events
---------------
 There has been many cool news and events from the release of the first
issue of Xine. Since i don't have time to put up a list of the cool thigs
that succeded or have to be done in a short time i would like just to
focus your attention to two GREAT events that will be this summer in
the first days of august. The events are HIP'97 (in The Netherlands) and
Beyond HOPE (in New York City). This two are two big convention, the first
organized by Hack-Tic guys, the second by the guys of 2600.
Well i will just include in this article the two mainpages (quite recent,
but i saw the HIP'97 page already changed a little) about these
two events, so maybe someone may found it interesting and partecipate.
If you would like to know more give a look to:

http://www.hip97.nl             for HIP'97
http://www.2600.com             and follow the links for Beyond HOPE

well, that's all for now :)

                                  HIP '97
                                      
   HIP is a place for hackers, artists, activists and many, many others
   to network themselves, both in the social and electronic sense of the
   word. HIP is a do-it-yourself event. We, the organizers, will provide
   the infrastructure, such as large tents, showers, toilets and large
   amounts of reliable electrical power and network connectivity. We'll
   also arrange for a basic set of workshops and lectures, mainly dealing
   with the social and political aspects of information technology,
   security, Internet, access to technology, new developments,
   cryptography and other 'hacker-related' topics that come to mind. We
   are open to suggestions for other fields of interest.
   
   At this moment we are working on discussions and workshops about
   smartcard security, Tempest attacks, the SPAM threat, Windows 95
   security, "practical" PGP attacks, "legal" hacking, virtual
   communities, cryptography and the law (Trusted Third Parties and Key
   Recovery), a tele-presence experiment, activism on the Net, and much
   more.
   
   HIP will take place on the Friday 8th, Saturday 9th and Sunday 10th of
   August 1997 at campsite Kotterbos, Aakweg, Almere in The Netherlands.
   The campsite is about a 30 minutes drive from Amsterdam.
   
   Remember 'Hacking at the End of the Universe' (HEU) in 1993? The
   people that published Hack-Tic, a computer underground magazine in The
   Netherlands, organized it. Hundreds of hackers, phone phreaks,
   programmers, computer haters, data travellers, electro-wizards,
   networkers, hardwarefreaks, techno-anarchists, communications junkies,
   cyber- and cypherpunks, system managers, stupid users, paranoid
   androids, Unix gurus, whizz kids and warez dudes spent three days
   building their own network between their tents in the middle of
   nowhere, located in the Flevopolder in The Netherlands.
   
   HIP will be the sequel to HEU. A campsite full of PCs, laptops, and
   Unix machines, all connected via an intertent Ethernet that is
   connected to the Internet. People from all over The Netherlands and
   other countries will come together to learn and discuss the benefits,
   as well as the risks of new technologies. They'll listen to lectures,
   join workshops, enjoy special presentations and, last but not least,
   party, all of this in a friendly open-air environment of a very wired
   campsite far away from the civilized world.
   
   HIP will happen on the same days as Beyond HOPE, a hacker convention
   in New York, organized by the people of 2600 Magazine. There will be
   audio and video links between both events, and we're working on cool
   gadgets to further enhance your sense of 'grassroots telepresence'.
   This will be a twin-event in the true sense of the word.
   
   A do-it-yourself event?
   
   We will absolutely need your help setting up everything once we're
   there. HIPcamp will open on August 5th, three days before HIP starts.
   If you decide to join in that early expect some pretty primitive
   circumstances. If you don't care about that, or think that's the best
   part, you can help build HIPnet and all other facilities.
   
   We also urgently need you to think now about what it is you would like
   to see and do at HIP. Just like Hacking at the End of the Universe in
   1993, we need lots of people that have ideas for organizing their own
   small part of HIP and the organizational talent to do this without too
   much help from us.
   
   One of the proven recipes for fun:
   
     * GET a group of friends together in an early stage; arrange how
       you're going to get there if you're far away.
     * THINK: Is there something you and your friends would like to show
       others, discuss or do there?
     * If so: TELL us about it, so we can coordinate, help or announce
       things.
     * BRING lots of computers and other electronics, maybe your own army
       surplus tent.
     * HOOK it all up once you get there.
     * Check out what others have been doing and MEET nice people, hang
       out, have fun!
       
   Of course you can also come alone and have lots of fun, and there will
   be a huge exhibition tent to set up computers in. In another big tent
   there will be near to a thousand chairs where you can listen to and
   participate with panel discussions.
   
   This event will be big, and as said, in this stage we're looking for
   people to organize their own chaotic little part of it. So don't mail
   us saying "put me on the list, I want to be a volunteer" when you
   could say "I'm xxx and I'd like to do yyy." Tell us what you need us
   to do. We could put your workshop or whatever it is you'd like to do
   in one of our announcements and on the website, so people can
   communicate with you beforehand. We could make sure there is enough
   room if your project requires a lot of space. You name it.
   
   We dream of an event with thousands of creators and no audience.
   
   You can use the newsgroup alt.hacking.in.progress to find people to
   work with at HIP. Or you can use the notice board at the website to
   search for someone to travel with to HIP. Use it to ask for help or
   offer some.
   
   This isn't going to be passive entertainment, we all work together to
   make it work. Also: HIP is not the event to buy a computer or get
   advice on buying one, and there're not going to be any beginner
   courses on using the Internet. If you're not into networking of some
   sort, you'll think it's boring.
   But if you're very technically inclined, part of some remote community
   on the edge of the net, or if the politics surrounding information
   technology are just your thing, HIP is definitely made for you (and by
   you, we hope).
   
   Who is organizing HIP?
   
   Once there was a little magazine in The Netherlands called 'Hack-Tic',
   and it published wild ways to play tricks on the information
   infrastructure of the world. The magazine doesn't exist anymore, but
   most of the people that wrote articles for the magazine or helped
   organize Hacking at the End of the Universe (1993) and even some of
   the people that helped put up the Galactic Hacker Party (1989) are
   still in touch with each other. The every-four-year-itch has gotten to
   us again...
   
   HIPcamp and HIPnet
   
   There'll be no hotel rooms or anything like that so you'll have to
   bring at least a tent and a sleeping bag to HIP, even if this means
   you can't bring the paper-tape unit that came with your VAX 11/780.
   We'll supply a campground, toilets, showers, good food and electrical
   power (as close to 220V/50Hz as possible) and we'll do our best to
   supply everyone who wants it with an Ethernet connection. You will
   probably be able to trade wiring, extra outlets, Ethernet cards, and
   the use of modular crimping tools for almost anything.
   
   HIPcamp will open on August 5th, three days before HIP starts. If you
   decide to join in that early expect pretty primitive circumstances. If
   you don't care about that, or think that's the best part, you can help
   build HIPnet and all other facilities.
   
   No audience?
   
   We'll try to offer different ways for the Internet population to truly
   interact with the events at HIP. Please get in touch if you'll have
   some friends at your house and you want to have CU-SeeMe or other
   connections to us. We'll also be broadcasting live and buffered feeds
   of audio and video on the net. Mass-media coverage will be provided
   for the interactively challenged.
   
   Press
   
   All press is welcome to visit HIP, but there will be a few strict
   rules. All members of the press will pay the entrance fee, no
   discussion about this. There will be a part of the campsite that is
   off-limits to all press. No filming, photographing or recording is to
   take place there. Some people like to have a press-free moment, some
   have employment-related reason for shunning media attention.
   
   What else?
   
   Many more things could be said but it is still a bit early. The main
   networking tent and the bar will be open 24 hours a day and we'll have
   a depository to stash your laptops, backpacks and other valuables. We
   haven't figures out the exact entrance fee, but, just like HEU, HIP is
   going to be a non-profit event. And if you haven't guessed it yet: all
   workshops and plenary events will take place in English.
   
   I want to be HIP too!
   
   Don't worry: you can be! Subscribe to the announcement mailing list.
   It's spam-free and will only carry HIP announcements written by us.
   You can also participate in the ongoing, yet slightly messy debate in
   the newsgroup alt.hacking.in.progress. If you can't find the newsgroup
   don't contact us. Refresh the grouplist in your newsreader or ask your
   access provider to check their newsfeed.

                                Beyond HOPE
                                      
                       The "Follow On" Conference to
                       Hackers On Planet Earth (HOPE)
                                      
                               New York City
                           1997 August 8, 9, & 10
                                      
   * About Beyond HOPE
          Beyond HOPE is a conference of hackers, phreaks, and netizens.
          Anyone is welcome, but we ask that you be prepared to listen at
          least half as much as you talk.
          
   * Where is Beyond HOPE being held?
          The Puck Building is in New York City on Houston Street between
          Lafayette and Mulberry. It is just south of Greenwich Village,
          and on the border of the Soho district. There is a floor plan
          available.
          
   * Where to stay
          Details on which hotels will be linked to the conference will
          be announced soon in this space. In the meantime, here are some
          nifty hotel links in New York City to give you an idea of what
          to expect.
          
   * Directions
          Subway: Take the Number 1 Local to Houston St and walk east.
          Take the Number 6 Local to Bleecker St and walk a block south.
          Take the A, C, or E train to Spring St and walk two blocks
          north. You're looking for the large building that says "The
          Puck Building" on it in large, friendly letters. Scholars of
          Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" will recognize the
          statue of Puck.
          
          Taxi: Tell the cabbie to go to Houston St and Lafayette.
          
          Note: There will be a special 2600 meeting on Friday, August
          8th from 5 pm to 8 pm at the Citicorp Center on 53rd and
          Lexington. To get to the conference from there, just hop on a
          downtown Number 6 train and get off at Bleecker Street.
          
   * How to get involved
          Get involved by e-mailing us. Be sure to include what you wish

            "in-work".
            
   * About the Puck building
          As everyone who really knows New York City agrees, the Puck
          Building is one of our most exceptional landmarks.
          
          Listed on the National Historic Register, this grand Romanesque
          Revival structure was designed by Albert Wagner and built in
          1885 for the J. Ottman Lithographic Company. Originally, the
          land on which the building stands was farmland owned by
          Nicholas Bayard. During the mid 1800's, the property held a
          house occupied by the Sisters of Charity, which was purchased
          and demolished in 1885 when construction of the current
          building began.
          
          The building's style reflects the Chicago School of
          architecture which was known for steel frame construction,
          horizontal bands of windows, and the skillful use of brick. In
          the case of the Puck, an unusual type of thin-line English
          brick was chosen for the facade. The building's exterior
          projects a feeling of strength balanced by lightness and
          graceful simplicity.
          
          more on the Puck Building....
          
   * About NYC
          What more needs be said? It's New York City, after all. The
          Bronx is up, and The Battery's down. Here's the Official New
          York City Web Site to help you. You'll also want to get tourist
          maps , brochures (if you have a high speed Internet link) from
          the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau Home Page.
          
   * BeyondHope FAQ
          E-mail questions, and they will be answered, and might show up
          here.
          
   * How to Pre-register
          Haven't gotten that far yet, but as you can see, we're thinking
          about it.
          
   * The Network
          We will have at the very least a T1 connection to the outside
          world. This promises to be one of the best network connections
          ever at a hacker conference. Again, to get involved, e-mail us.
