Virus Executables Disclaimer
----------------------------
 There are also some already compilated viruses in this package. To
avoid the possibility of somebody getting infected by accident we
deliberately changed the first byte of every virus that can be easily
runned from the shell (this mean that boot viruses aren't included) to a
RET, so, as they are now, can't do any harm (definitely they don't do
anything :) ). The virus can be easily reactivated by just calculating the
right opcode of the changed byte. BUT remember that if you change that
opcode then we suppose that YOU are conscious of what you are doing so
YOU are the only responsable if that copy of the virus will do any kind of
harm to your or to other computers. We told you, so don't complain in the
future :)

Language Disclaimer
-------------------
 We are not all from a country where the first language is English, so
please try to be a little comprensive when you find huge grammatical
errors in our zine. Of course we will try to write in a good English but
we hope that we wouldn't come out with 3l33+ +}{r453 l1|<3 +}{15 ;)))
