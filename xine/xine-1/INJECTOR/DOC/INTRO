Injector version 0.666 BETA
by KernelPanik (kp@ikx.org) and b0z0 the Clown (b0z0@ikx.org)

Injector is a tool with the following aims:

1) To be a good dos sniffer.

2) To be a mean to inject TCP/IP packets in a network.

3) To be an enviroment for writting C programs that deal with network.

It uses a packet driver to comunicate with the network adapter. It MUST be
loaded at interrupt vector 96 (0x60). You should have got one of these 
drivers with the network adapter, othrwise look at some good DOS 
Internet archive (i.e. SimTel). It currently supports only Blue Book 
Ethernet packet frames, so NO Token-Ring or IEEE 802.3 LLC. 

Injector is written in Borland C++ 3.0. There may be some problems 
with other compilers :-). Use the large memory model.

Whene the program starts you see the packets flowing in the upper part
of the screen. In the lower you can type commands.

Refer to files cmds, bltin, newcmds for further information.

Drop me a line if you do any enhachments, find any bug or 
if you have a question!

Note that this is only beta version and so there are many more things
to be done ... so don't blame us to much :-)

Happy Hacking!
