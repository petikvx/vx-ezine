doippkt is a utility that helps to build a datagram which can be send over
a TCP/IP network. It calculates checksum and packet lengths. The syntax
is:

doippkt [infile] [outfile]

Every line is interpreted upon the first char in it. The allowd charter
are:
 
char      	meanning		Example
#	   	a comment		# this is an example
c	   	1 byte decimal		c34
u		2 byte decimal		d8231
b		1 byte hex		b7A
w		2 byte word		wAAD0
s		a string		sFoo Bar
d		udp separator
i		icmp separator
t 		tcp separator
e		ethernet separator

e is mandatory and divides ethernet header and TCP/IP info. d,i or t
divide IP header and respective header. As i said the fields involving
checksums and length are automatically calculated and should be left
blank.
