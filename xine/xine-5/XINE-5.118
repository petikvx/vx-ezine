 ÄÄÄÄÄÄ´ Introduction ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 In given  articles I shall describe the theory about viruses for a  platform 
 Palm, all my researches about a beginning of  June 2000. As I shall describe 
 all problems of viruses for Palm,  as them to make more distributed, as well 
 as that is  necessary to make to not  involve(attract) attention of the user 
 to a virus.

 It simply theory which should force  virmaker which wants t o write a  virus 
 for PalmOS to write it very cautiously and to make it more hardy.

 
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄ´ Is a Palm OS virus possible? ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Yes the viruses under Palm are possible(probable). Whether exist viruses for 
 Palm? Yes  certainly  exist - 1 virus, 1  trojan  which  in  my  opinion the 
 company mcafee (I has written  antivirus  there is no time did  not  respect 
 this company). 
 As it is the  company only it is known by the  stupid scanner and  certainly 
 they do not have sales they  and have made AV under Palm and in 2 days there 
 was a first virus. All this is very strange...  

 To me set questions  why virmaker  do not write  viruses  under Palm?  In my 
 opinion the viruses should be written on assembler, as this  language is not 
 similar on PC assembler the time that to it to get used is necessary.

 The viruses under Palm soon  will are very  popular only it  is necessary to 
 find the best approach to a spelling them.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄ´ RAM memory ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 The  first  obstacle  is  the way Palm  Pilots store  data  and  binaries.  
 Currently, Palm Pilots store all of their data and binaries in  RAM. As most 
 of  you  know, RAM  will  lose  its  contents once it  becomes  deprived  of 
 electricity. This is one of the primary reasons why  it  is an absolute must
 to backup your data to your PC/MAC.  How does this fact pose as an obstacle? 
 First off, the fact that batteries  do eventually  run out  will  limit  the 
 amount of time a virus would have to spread. The virus would  have to infect 
 as many executables as possible. It seems that to me almost probably when at 
 user has  from 5 up to 8 megabytes of RAM. Though  there are a  heap of  the 
 users at which only programs, necessary to them, and any documents.
 The virus for Palm means  should be as small as possible  and test memory we 
 shall suffice it RAM memory for distribution.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄ´ Problem of distribution ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Many users download of the program from  internet in PC/MAC (leave backups a 
 copy of the program) and then only loading  in Palm. It means if to exchange 
 the program that only with PC/MAC of the computer instead of with Pilot.. In 
 it a problem.  Well there are other users which do not store(keep) on PC/MAC 
 backups of a copy to us it is necessary to be adjusted on such users.

 ş Space - Pilots tend to  have memory  constraints. Pilot memory size ranges 
 from 1 megabyte  to 8  megabytes. Developers  will prefer  to have  alot  of 
 storage space, so the  logical  choice is using a PC/MAC.  Hard  drives  for 
 PC's/MAC's now have storage space that falls in the gigabyte spectrum.

 ş Speed is a very crucial factor. As a matter of fact,even more crucial than 
 on a PC/Macintosh. On a PC/MAC, the user usually won't mind waiting a minute 
 or two  for a  program to  load. But on a Palm Pilot, if  a virus causes the 
 program to take any longer than about 10-20 seconds, the user isn't going to 
 be happy. Our user will simply need to wipe out all executables and reinstal 
 fresh copies.

 ş In many Pilot not so there are a lot  of programs  and at some users these 
 programs can be counted on fingers and occurrence of the new program (if you 
 want the user will write worm) to look her and if that that will find in her 
 faster all it is the program will be removed.

 All these problems are necessary are to taken  into account  and to  made by
 (with) a virus more hardy, so that it had many  ways of distribution.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄ´ ROM File problem or new infection? ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Although RAM memory will  eventually lose  its contents,  flash  ROM  won't. 
 Flash ROM is basically  ROM memory that retains data after the power is gone 
 and can be read from and written to. The  Palm OS itself  is  present in the 
 Flash ROM chips. The possibility that a  virus could  infect the  flash  ROM 
 definately exists.

 If we can pathing ROM  a file that we almost resident... We shall  have many 
 opportunities... 

  ù Flash ROM will retain its data after the batteries run out 
  ù We receive many opportunities of work with files
  ù The virus cannot be removed. The standard user can not it make.

 But at this way is much and lacks:

 ş If the virus doesn't infect the flash ROM properly, the ROM may no 
   longer work and even if it does, the user will experience  serious 
   problems and will get a  program that will replace  the flash ROM.

 ş Even if  the virus does infect the  flash ROM correctly, the virus 
   will be incompatible with  future Palm OS  upgrades. For  example, 
   suppose this virus manipulates the section of the ROM that handles 
   files. The virus  manipulates  it in such  a way  that whenever an 
   executable is run, it will run first, infect  the  host  and  then 
   transfer  control  of  the  processor to  the  original code. In a 
   future  Palm OS  upgrade,  who  knows  what  this  virus  will  be 
   manipulating!! It could wind up  manipulating  the code that draws 
   graphics. And  since  it  was  designed  to  manipulate  the  file 
   handling code, it will mess up  the graphics  drawing  code, if it 
   does not  check for this. The  check  is implemented  so that  the 
   virus will not  manipulate if the  file handling code is no longer 
   there. 
 
 ş There is very  much plenty ROM of files  they almost all different 
   for the different  versions PalmPilot... It is  almost  impossible 
   patching all ROM files...

 ş As the user can install new Rom a file or updating it.

 
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄ´ PalmPilot W0rm ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 Since a worm  is basically  another self  contained Pilot application, there 
 areproblems  with  visibility.  For  example,  suppose the worm  intercepted 
 Hotsync operations so that  whenever a Hotsync occured, the worm would  also 
 be transferred. The  user is going to  notice something  strange when he/she 
 sees a program being transfered that they never even knew about. Furthermore, 
 once our user peeks into his backup  directory, he'll see a  PRC  file  that 
 isn't supposed to be there. In this case, the PRC file is the worm.

 The worm would need some way of hiding itself from that list of applications. 
 The first thing that comes to mind is the application type.Within any PalmOS 
 application,normally the application type will have the four character name: 
 Appl. If this name is something else,  the program will  not  show up in the 
 applications list. Furthermore,  the program will not be  runable by  normal
 means. It would have to be started by another program.

 I am not sure if this is possible.  Theoretically, one c ould make a program 
 that will  change the  application  type  of  another  program. If  this  is 
 possible, this  would  be  one great  way for a worm to hide itself. In this 
 case, the following will h appen once the worm gets run: (All theoretically) 

 ù 1. Changes the application type of another program 
 ù 2. Renames itself to the name of the victim program 
 ù 3. Steals the other program's icon 

 From the user's point of view, the  original  program  appears  to be on the 
 list. When the user taps on the worm's icon, the worm will first do whatever 
 it  wants  and  then will pass  control to  the  original  victim. The  user 
 wouldn't notice a thing.

 A worm can be setup to check the launch code to see if a Hotsync is starting 
 up. If so, our worm can make sure that when the Pilot is transfering data to 
 the PC/MAC, the worm will be transfered too.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄ´ API patching ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 It is a little the small theories.... Now I will explain trap patching. Palm 
 OS applications typically will call API routines. An API routine is simply a 
 chunk  of  code, usually  within  the Palm OS itself, that  will  perform  a 
 specific task, such as: drawing a line,  displaying text, sound  generation, 
 etc. 

 What  does this  have to do  with trap patching? A PalmOS  application  must 
 generate a trap #15 exception. This  basically halts  the processor  in  its 
 tracks, and then control  of the processor will be transfered to the part of 
 the PalmOS  which  will check  what API  is being called. Next  PalmOS  will 
 transfer  control of the  processor over to the appropriate API routine. How 
 does the system find the location in the flash  ROM to transfer  control to? 
 It will check a table of  addresses for each API routine and from there does 
 the rest. 

 Trap patching is  the process of  going to the table  of addresses, changing 
 the address to a particular API routine, and changing that  address to point 
 to where the worm is located  in memory. What part of the worm shall have to 
 control  transfered  to  it ?  It`s  "trap handler".  The  trap  handler  is 
 responsible  for doing whatever action is necessary  and then giving control 
 of the processor to the original API routine.

 It not my idea she very simply has liked  to me I has decided her to publish 
 in thiz articles.

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄ´ Last Word ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 I still back to a theme of distribution of a  virus for Palm, most likely in 
 e-zine MATRiX#3. A thank large that you read this clause I shall wait anyone 
 the comment and requests new of ideas.
