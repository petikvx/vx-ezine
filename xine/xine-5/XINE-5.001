  Back !
  ÄÄÄÄÄÄ

 We are back, after a long period. Many people may think we are dead,
 that's not new. Many people also think that Ikx is old school and old
 school members left the business. That's wrong again ! Here we are,
 trying to improve, trying to put some new ideas, even if majority of
 members are quite busy all the time. So, what's up ? Seems that ikx
 definitively turned vxers, untill we found new hacking phreaking
 members, but well, a clever coder stay a clever code, some of us may
 a day code network or put their genius brain working on some "dark"
 tech. So for the rest, I would like to thank members that believed and
 trusted the ikx, keeping group life, continuing investigation, keep
 working all that for not a penny. I would like also thank much every
 people that contributed in any forms, who broke their ass, who did
 something, who got ideas, wich contribute to bring to you the zine
 you are currently watching. So I hope it will please you, let you
 accroched during hours, helping your insomnias to be less boring !

 We are happy to see that few zine are still released with good materials
 and some clever coders are still around. From matrix-2 to 29a-5, we
 are also happy to see that the scene is not dead. Well, the scene
 philosophy is not yet as in my utopist view, getting insulted in such
 channels is not difficult, and even if what you have done don't please
 to everybody, kewl will you say, but well, vxers are not there to
 make war not juging others works, viruses should be like sexuality,
 some pratice a few, other a lot, some try bizarre things, some prefer
 quality to quantity, everybody his ass, and the word peace and love
 seems hard to understand to many people. Virus writers are often affamed
 by fame, people and groups want to be the best on the scene, to have
 done the best viruses and to be respecte and admired by all, wich
 usually make some people doing easy work and showing it as l33t code.
 Well, I don't put jugement, and from the few year I'm in, I can
 say that's not new. But I think we should forget it, fame is may be the
 real motor of the scene, the little thing wich make things advancing,
 wich make technology advancing, wich give the movement, but fame is
 materially nothing, it's not coz you coded a 500 lines super virus
 you are better than other and no, it wont make your cock longer, sorry
 guys, I knew it was a sad news...

 From our little kitchen, I would like to say a big welcome in this
 issue to three new members wich joined us lately, first of all, this
 jewish gay ass called asmodeus, wich finally joined the ikx by
 performing a rocket jump with ak-47 at counter strike. Author of a
 very few virus, he seems a clever guy, allways learning, and getting
 better skill, I think you will hear of him in the future. After I would
 like to say an hello to lifewire, a cool funky niggah wich have still
 hard to use his new computer he received for christmas. A coder as I
 like them, doing this in the rules of the art, wich joined by performing
 two salto feet attached and who fortunately and have fucking good
 designer skill. Also, and thirdly, I would like to say welcome to
 VitalX very good and clever coder with damnit good ideas, wich seems
 to have time to time dead modem and don't yet understood to what serve
 an operating system. His nice little rocking babies will rules, I'm
 sure! So, the ikx team growed a bit, remembering the few hard times
 of the past. -ikx 4 ever, inch allah !- (Also, if u are interrested to
 join, don't think we ask you to make extraordinary things as in this
 text, was just kidding =)

 Also, I would like to make a special hello to s0ftproject guys, nice
 team and special bau to haph, wich kept the ikx channel less dead and
 put a bit of life there, helped us to make trouble along the scene :)
 long life to ya sadomasochist free-bsd develloper

 We are sorry, couldn't attend the 2000 vx meeting, but well, will try
 to attend the next one, and also, remember hip 2001 odyssey, c ya there !
 
 And remember first rule, we don't ask question about project mayhem
