 Here goes the interview i made in September'2k to Benny, member of the group
 29A. There is only one mistake: when he says 29A is the best group. Ofc0z
 i don't agree, iKx is the best one X-P

 There was an interview previous to this one made by me to him, but one
 year ago. As it was outdated, i rewritten the questions and he answered
 politely.

 iKX> Billy Belcebu/iKX
 B>   Benny/29A

Interview with Benny/29A [Take 2]
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ 

iKX> Hello Benny, it's time to introduce yourself to our readers ;) 

B>   Well, hello readerz, my handle is Benny, I'm member of 29A group and I 
     like to code cool viruses... 


iKX> All the interviews always have the same question. This is a requeriment, 
     as we always want to know it about all our mates from the scene. Well, 
     as you are intelligent, you are expecting this... Why did you choose 
     your nick? Have you ever used another nicks? What do you like and what 
     you dislike of your nick? 

B>   When I started to explore the Internet, I used many nicknamez. But when
     I entered the scene, I already used nickname "Benny" for about one year. 
     Benny is the name of singer of group I liked that time. I wanted to
     change my nickname to some "underground" name, but the first time I
     connected to IRC I accidently typed "Benny" (again!) and everybody
     remembered me as "Benny". Then I could not change that back :) 

     I think "Benny" is very neutral nickname, nothing like "H4x0rKiNg"
     lame-style and I like to use it. I don't think I'll ever change my
     nickname. 


iKX> Well, when we are talking with someone in IRC we make an image in our 
     mind about how would be his face... So, please clear the ideas of our 
     readers... describe yourself phisically, please :) 

B>   Ok dokey... I was born in 1982 in spring, so you can calculate how old I
     am now. I have brown hairs, blue-green eyes, I'm something between 180
     and 190 centimeterz tall... I'm normal sexy czech guy :P 


iKX> You've already told how ugly you are. Just kidding :P Now it's time to
     describe your "inner" person, ie, describe yourself morally, politically, 
     socially, philosophically... Also we want to know what you do in your 
     real life... study, work, etc :) 

B>   Oh, this will be really long answer :) Ok, so, morally, I'm very liberal
     perfectionistic guy... becoz of many drugs I like to think about shit,
     about nonsence thingz, sometimez with melancholic, sometimez with happy
     mood :)
     My problem is that I think more than is healthy, sometimez I would like 
     just to STOP thinking. My thinking often bringz me some problems. Weird, 
     heh? :) 

     Politically? Hmmm, my opinion is that people MUST change themself (their 
     thinking) if they don't want to die... this world is going to die. 
     Communism, capitalism, everything is just mirror of ppl's soul, another 
     political system simply can't save the world. If there could exist the 
     worst political system, even it would work very well if ppl wouldn't be 
     bitchez. Communism can't work, simply can't, becoz ppl are simply bitchez.
     Perhaps there must come some apocalypse or such thing that could change 
     humen, then we can survive - when ppl won't be able to breath becoz of 
     poluted air, then ppl will start to think about the nature. When ppl will
     be dieing becoz of war, then they will start to think about humanity. 
     There could come only some miracle to change this destiny :( 

     This time (autumn 2000) I study the last year of high-school specialised
     to Information Technologies (ITs)... I hate this school becoz there are
     very stupid teacherz - they know absolutely NOTHING about computerz -
     and I hate when idiot is "above" me... I'm looking forward to finish
     this school, go to Amsterdam (to get better mood and experiment with
     drugs AGAIN :) and then find some job here, in Czech Republic...:P 


iKX> When did you have your first experience with viruses? What motivated to 
     do them? Describe the feeling of creating life to our readers :) 

B>   My father's computer was infected by many viruses and I had some
     antivirus on a diskette (I knew NOTHING about computerz that time). That
     AV deleted every infected file (= every system file :) and the computer
     couldn't work. My father was very angry - that was the first experience
     with viruses.

     Some yearz after that, I learned computerz at school and I heard about 
     viruses. I wanted to know to code them, becoz it sounded very interesting 
     to me - also, I liked to read about viruses in virus encyclopedias. After
     many months of researching, coding, reading, learning assembler,
     processor, operating system... one lamer became the most famous virus
     coder in Czech Republic... you decide how gewd am I in virus coding now.

     I really like to code viruses... it's very good feeling to finish the
     virus and see how ppl like that. Really very good feeling... 


iKX> Ok, we know now your reasons. Please tell us what viruses have you done, 
     and add your description about all them :) Don't cut'n'paste them from 
     AVPVE! X-D Btw, tell me the reason of each one of their names, your 
     mental state when doing them, all that involved its developement, etc... 

B>   Oh, fuck, I've coded 10 viruses (autumn 2000) and you want the
     description of all of them? X-D I'll describe only the bests of the
     bests viruses I have done, Ok? So... 

     Win98.BeGemot: the name come from Bible and means some terrible animal,
     the ground variant of Leviathan (the variant of devil living in the 
     sea). I included there maaaany techniques I really liked... but 
     the best is, I think, that it can communicate with user by 
     external communication console. You can monitor it, "talk" with 
     it and set some parameters to it. I like this idea - you can 
     talk with your baby. 

     Win98.Yobe: This is the first cluster virus (Dir-II virus mechanism) for
     Windows. It includes many anti-* techniques (e.g. Ring0 threads) 
     and as AVP says, its very interesting from the technical point 
     of view and I believe them :) I spent many hours coding that 
     and I hope you like it... it's my Amsterdam VX meeting's virus, 
     I had very good mood... I met so many nice ppl, I fell in love 
     in Amsterdam, I was st0ned all the time... oh, fuck, this virus 
     presents all good things that happened to me in 1999 year... 

     The name comes again from Bible :) 

     Win32.Vulcano: Very kewl virus imho. Its the first virus with
     InterProcess Communication abilities (multi-process virus). All
     instances of virus can communicate between each other... if the virus
     wants to infect the file, it says another virus to do that. Its very 
     strong anti-* technique, becoz the virus does nothing... nothing 
     in current process, but everything in another process :) This 
     virus is perhaps still very difficult to analyse, becoz AVerz 
     still haven't released the description...:P 

     I chose the name when I was watching some document about Vulcans in
     Hawaii, dunno why :)

     Win2k.Installer:The first Windows 2000 MSI cavity infector, coded
     together with Darkman on our vx meeting in his house in Denmark. I'm
     sure you already heard about it, the virus is famous same as Win95.Boza. 
     In Darkman's house there was one big chocolate of hash and I smoked it
     all - in this "mood" I coded all my parts of virus :)) That time I broke
     up with girl, however, I like to remember that atmosphere. 

     The name is "Installer" becoz it can (as a first virus) infect  MSIs -
     Microsoft Installer filez.

     Win2k.Stream: The most famous virus in Czech Republic, coded together
     with Ratter in his flat. It presents the "stream companion" technique
     based on NTFS file system. Very primitive, but very innovative virus :) 

     The name is becoz it uses "streamz" - new feature in NTFS. 

     Win32.HIV: Right now, the virus is still not finished, I'm waiting for
     Darkman - he promised me to code some stuff for that. It bringz
     "brand-new", "never seen before" advanced Win32 techniques. Just look at
     that.

     Why "HIV"? Becoz its the most famous virus... I downloaded some
     animations and pictures about HIV and I really like this one. In fact,
     its very interesting virus.


iKX> Why did you decided to join 29A? When did you do that? 

B>   29A is known as the best VX group ever. I wanted to be in the best
     group; do you remember how I told you that I'm perfectionist - whatever
     I do, I want to be perfect and the best. 

     I joined 29A in the spring of 1999, after I finished some interesting 
     viruses. 


iKX> What group of the VX scene you like more (apart from 29A ;) ? And what 
     coder? 

B>   Yeah, I really l0ve 29A :) Apart of it, I like iKX. These groupz are imo 
     the best in the scene. What coder I like most? I really like GriYo's
     work, his ideas are really fantastic. 


iKX> And outside the scene... what group/individual you like more? 

B>   The human I really like the most is "Timothy Leary" - the propagator of 
     drugs (mainly of mushrooms and LSD) in the hippies age. IMHO he was a 
     genius, his death is really big lost for this world. 


iKX> What is your favourite virus? Why? What kind of virus do you like more, 
     megainfectors or very small viruses? 

B>   The virus must be original. It can be very small (hello Super :) or 
     it can be very big (hello Prizzy :), but it must show some new
     techniques or ideas... then I like it. If the virus is average, I don't
     like it.

     I don't have any favourite virus... I like some viruses and some viruses
     I don't like... I can't remember any name of "the best" virus... 


iKX> Now the question you are all waiting for... Really, here is it. What's 
     your viewpoint about the everytime discussed "perfect virus" theme? 

B>   Perfect virus? Heh, the virus that can become undetectable, that can
     spread very fast on every machine (without user activity), virus that
     can communicate between other variants of viruses, update itself and
     virus that you can control, monitor... yeah, this is a dream. 

     However, my project I'm working on right now is the similar kind of worm 
     that will be able to do "almost" everything described above. But it won't 
     be ever perfect virus, becoz everytime you can code something "better". 
     And if something can be done better, its not perfect. 


iKX> Where do you think the VX scene is heading to? What will be next 
     revolutionary step in the field of virus creation? 

B>   When someone will invent any way how to code virus/worm with artifical 
     inteligence... but it will take some time... 


iKX> What do you think about those scandals that hit the scene some months 
     ago? (Melissa, U.S. closed SOK and CB's site, VBS.LoveLetter shit, etc). 
     Do u think this is the next step of the USA for control the information 
     in internet? Do you see it as an attack to the freedom of speech? 

B>   USA is piece of shit! USA tries to control the world, but there is a
     small problem - 90% of american ppl are idiots. Napster scandal, RIAA
     shit is the proof. USA is like old USSR, not with red hammer, but with
     white starz, thats the only difference. I HATE USA. WHY? I HATE IDIOTIC
     PPL. THATS WHY I HATE USA. 

     Heh, do you know that in manuals for microwave owens there MUST be
     attention that animals should not be dried in owen...? becoz many idiots
     did it, they won the court and the companies had to pay them. Ain't that
     stupid?

     My aunt lives in L.A. She told me, that there are so many idiots, that
     its almost impossible to be truth. She told me, that if there is any
     smart guy, theres no problem be be called as a genius... between blind
     ppl, one-eyed is the king... Is it truth? You decide! FUCK OFF USA! I
     don't like when the idiot says what is smart and what is not... USA
     tries to do that :/ 


iKX> Should viruses be illegal? Should coders be jailed? (Mwahahah!) :) Is it 
     illegal in your country? 

B>   Illegal is to spread the viruses, not to code them. And becoz I don't 
     spread viruses, I don't have problems with justice. Problems will come 
     when I will be really famous in .cz, then the police will try to jail 
     me - "exemplary case" - just to show that police is not inactive. Police 
     does not need any reason, they just need to want :( Thats bad. 

     Viruses should NOT be illegal. IMO if ppl would be smart, viruses would 
     have NO chance to spread. But becoz the ppl are NOT smart, they need some 
     laws to protect them before things that are smartER then them. 


iKX> As i can read inside you, i guess you were in the VX'99 meeting that 
     took place in Amsterdam... (phuck, i envy u!). Also you were one of the 
     main impulsors of the VX'2k meeting in Brno, Czech Republic. Well, tell 
     our readers your feelings when you met with so "strange" people :) Did 
     you imagined them as they were? What did you do (related to vx, we all 
     know you all got st0ned, and drunk as hell)? :P 

B>   Hehe, yeah, we got always stoned and drunk as hell :) Yeah, I was the
     main organisator of VX'2k meeting in Brno, becoz I live there. Every
     day we smoked a hash and drank many beerz (hi Gigz :)... I really
     enjoyed that (if you want to know more about our meeting, look at my
     page: http://benny29a.cjb.net, there you can find long article about
     that meeting). We did almost nothing except using various drugz :)
     However, on the meeting at Ratter's home we coded together Win2k.Stream
     virus, which is very famous in .cz. 

     My feelingz? It was fantastic, to meet all those ppl from IRC in the
     real life... I didn't imagine them as they were... no, noone could :)
     I wish we, ALL VXerz, should meet one day each other... one BIG
     world-wide meeting... uthopy? 


iKX> We know that a sucker made a "fake" version of your Win32.Leviathan, 
     here you can tell him "some" things... C'mon! 

B>   Heh. You lamer! You think you are smart? You think you are boss when 
     you just changed the text inside my virus? Hahah, you showed us that you 
     are not smart, you are simply idiot that is sooo stupid that he can't 
     code his own proggy. You suxx man...! 

     Thanx Billy, it's much better now :) 


iKX> What makes you to be still alive? What are your hobbies and interests in 
     the so called "real-life" (if it there is one of those)? 

B>   I still believe my life has a sense. I wanted to be someone and now I 
     think I am... And hey! I still haven't coded so called "perfect virus", 
     I still must live and do that :) 

     I like to code, I like internet, underground, cyberspace, my friends
     from VX scene... I don't like the drugs... but the drugs like me :) 


iKX> How do you use to code? (stoned, music, cigarretes, etc) 

B>   I really like to code when I am stoned with good psychedelic music...
     throw all my problems away and concentrate myself only on one thing.
     When I code I smoke cigarettes, weed and/or hash (if I have any)... it
     bringz me many ideaz I couldn't get without that... in my country theres
     problem to find a good weed, thats a problem :/ 


iKX> Do you think your existence without viruses? Do virus coding changed 
     your life? If so, in what things? 

B>   Yeah, it ABSOLUTELY changed my life. I have many new friends, I
     understand computerz (I can get job easier than without my knowledges),
     I better understand this shitty world... I can't imagine what freak I
     would be me without VX scene... 


iKX> Do the near people to u know that you create life without ejaculations? 

B>   And who said that I create life only without ejaculation? :D Just
     kidding X-D Yeah, unfortunatelly, my friends knows who is "Benny", becoz
     I used "Benny" nick before I entered the scene. And many ppl,
     schoolmates, parents, friends of my friends know it too... I know it can
     bring me problems in a future, but I can't do anything with that now...
     I'm type of human which wants to present his opinion in public. I think
     virus coding is gewd thing, but my problem is that I have a need to
     explain it to everyone I meet...

iKX> Mmm... ok, let's imagine you'll have to spend a full night of sex, drugs 
     and rock'n'roll, but you only can choose to spend that night with: 
        a) Sarah Gordon 
        b) Patti Hoffman 
        c) Natalya Karsperskaya 
        d) a+b+c all together in an orgy (Eugene will be watching also ;) 
        e) Retch 
        f) IntelServ 
        g) Retch penetrating IntelServ, and IntelServ fucking you also ;) 

B>   Hmmmm, lemme think :DD 
     I would choose a)... I would like to show Sarah Gordon how can "the 
     typical virus writer" FUCK... then she could profile us better :) 


iKX> Ok, another difficult question :) What would you do if you are working 
     in an AV company and they tell you to write the disinfection routine of 
     your latest virus? ;) 

B>   Hmmm, I would write it... my hobby would be also my job, what else do you
     need in yer life? :) 


iKX> What do you think of the barrier present between the both sides of the 
     scene (AV and VX)? Is the future of almost every coder to finish in an 
     AV company? 

B>   AVerz work for money, we work becoz its our hobby. What is better? If
     you could work becoz its your hobby and get paid for that. However,
     AVerz have to present themself in another way - "Look at those idiots,
     they code viruses! Be smart and download our newest antivirus to protect
     yourself against those freax!" If it will not change, I will never work
     for AV company. AV = money. More lies = more money. No hobby, only money.

     I dont think this is the dream of every virus writter. However, virus 
     writters understand viruses and their knowledges can be useful... in many 
     IT companies, not only in AV ones. 


iKX> Do you think it's a "moral" act infect other people? What do you think 
     about destructive payloads? 

B>   In a short words: I dont infect computerz of other people and I dont like
     destructive viruses, becoz it loox lame to me. 


iKX> What's your viewpoint on macro viruses? And what about the VCK (Virus 
     Creation Kits)? And what about the new breed of internet viruses made 
     with VBS and such? 

B>   Yeah, the same. I dont like macro viruses, becoz todays macroviruses are
     lame. VCKs? Who needs them? Who use them? Why ppl code them? I dont know. 



iKX> Well, most of us don't know a shit about your country,the Czech Republic 
     (besides that your football national selection was a finallist in the 
     Euro'96 championsip). Tell us something about living there, what is 
     your viewpoint on the pseudo-communism you had (till recently, as far as 
     i know), what's your place in that society (high/medium/poor class), and 
     such like. Yes, we're curious :) 

B>   Huh... my country is not very well known, even we frequently win almost 
     every ice-hockey championship, we have the best beer in the world, we are
     in the center of Europe, even Madlain Albright was born in Czech Republic;
     noone know us... thats a pity... if you will ask some american guy where 
     is Czech Republic, he will probably answer that its in the east Europe, 
     some part of Russia or such shit. We are not in east Europe, we are right
     in the center...:/ 

     Becoz we lived for more than 40 yearz in communism, ppl's morality is 
     spoiled. Everybody is searching for money, becoz everybody did it before 
     10 yearz - in 1989 the communism broke and the capitalism came. All ppl 
     know, that "who does not steal does break family". That's the opinion 
     of many ppl here, everybody tries to earn big money (whatever way) and 
     leave .cz. But becoz of that, becoz of 50 yearz we are getting pissed off 
     everyday, we have a big potential, potential of knowledge, art and 
     abilities... that's why almost every czech freak that goes to foreign 
     country find very good job - he's smart and he find a country that finds 
     his knowledges useful... many rich countries (USA, Germany, ...) use us
     as a cheap geniuses :/ 

     My place in society? I think I'm in the medium class. My parents are not 
     poor, but they earn money and don't invest in me... if I want something, 
     I must earn money, go to work or wait for x-mas :) 


iKX> Where would you like to make a travel? And where would you like to live? 

B>   Amsterdam, Amsterdam and again Amsterdam! I visited Amsterdam two timez
     and I will visit it again. I L0VE Ansterdam and I would like to live
     there.


iKX> What VXer(s) would you like (most) to meet in the real life? 

B>   I would like to meet all VXerz from Spain... till now I met only a few 
     ppl from Spain and they were all wonderful ppl. I believe the rest is 
     the same, thats why I would like to meet with them. Apart of that, Spain 
     is another drug-center of Europe, so... :) 


iKX> Have you any experience (or interest) in any other activity of the 
     underground stuff like Hacking, Cracking, etc? 

B>   Hmmm, I play a bit with Hacking, becoz hacking Windows machines is very 
     similar to writing viruses. If you hack, you do almost everything... If
     you write viruses, viruses do your work. Thats not big difference. Thats
     a shame that VXerz and hackerz don't have closer relation... however, in
     my country every journalist call me "hacker"... 


iKX> It seems that scene is living a revolution coming from your country, the 
     Czech Republic. Prizzy, Ratter, m0rt, youself... What do you think about 
     the virus-scene in your country? Do you think it will stay growing? Or 
     it is already in the zenith? 

B>   Hmmm, in Czech Republic there are many hackerz and virus writerz, but 
     they usually do all work "incognito", you'll never hear about such guyz 
     two timez - and they usually don't hack/infect computerz, they are just 
     learning... Only some hackerz and virus writerz stay in the scene for 
     longer time, such those guyz you named above :) 

     Czech Republic has a great potential, same as Slovakia... much bigger
     than USA, for instance. That's becoz of environment, were we live, becoz
     of our past and present political system, becoz of mentality of our ppl...

     I believe, one time, when I will leave the scene, there will be many 
     virus writerz that could take my place. Ratter is the type of guy that 
     can do that. He's very talented... 


iKX> Ok, i think it's enough for today, don't you? :) So, this interview (it 
     seems an interrogatory instead) is reaching its end. It's your time, you 
     can greet someone, say whatever you want to say... See ya! 

B>   Yeah, very long interview... I hope your readerz weren't bored while
     they were reading this... 
     Also I would like to thank all ppl that were in the meeting in Brno for 
     very nice time, and also Rajaat - after the meeting I went to visit 
     Amsterdam - I stayed in his house, where we had big fun, full of VX and
