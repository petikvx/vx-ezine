                  INT13H/IKX interviews SUPER/29A
                 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Super is a spanish member of the virus group 29A, he is a very talented
coder  with  exceptionals  skills in optimizing the code to the minimum
possibel  and  sometimes  to the impossibel. Did u remember that little
war  between  Talon (RIP!) and Dark Angel about the writing of the sma-
llest tsr com/exe infector? Well, let's remember them:

    Dark  Angel   programmed  the  Small  virus  with  278  bytes.
    Talon wrote the smallest virus he could manage with 263 bytes.
    Very  tiny  viruses  really  and with nice tricks inside. But
    later,  appeared  in  VLAD#6  a  virus called Small signed by
    Super, with only ­168 bytes!.

The  optimization  level  impressed  me.  Well, that was long time ago.
Today,  Super  is  one  of  my best IRC-friends and still I didn't find
another  coder  with  his  optimization skills. Just take a look at his
STCE (Super Tiny Compresion Engine) published in 29A#2. He also coded a
tsr/com/exe  infector  with only  72 bytes, the virus is called Galindo
and  it will be part of 29A#3. Well, for all these reasons I decided to
interview   him   and   now  I  will  finish  this  fool  introduction.

IKX> Well, tell us about the guy known as Super

I am 24 (yes, a bit too old) years old. I have black hair and black eyes,
no I ain't darkman X-D
I'm a man of few words, as you can read of my short answers in this
interview  :)
I like programming (only in assembler), girls, body-building, watching
comedy, erotic movies on TV and RedBull.  :-D


IKX> Why did u choose Super as your nickname?

I didn't choose it! My friends did choosed it, when I was attending school.
I look very much like Clark Kent (Superman), so they called me Superman.
Soon after that they shortened it to "Super" and that nickname kinda got
stuck. Some of my friends tell me i look a bit like Jim Carrey too.. I think
I'm a mixture of Jim Carrey and Superman.. I'm SuperJim  X-DD


IKX> When you entered in the computer's world?

I entered this world when I was 13 years old, with an awesome PC 4.7 Mhz and
20M of HD.
At that time I only played games and use it for schoolwork.


IKX> And when did viruses get your attention for the very first time?

When I was 14 I got infected by the ping-pong virus. I pretty much didn't
care about the bouncing call. I didn't even knew it was a virus, I learned
that later X-D
After that I discovered a utility called DEBUG, and I start playing around
with it. It was interesting, and not as dangerous as FDISK and FORMAT  X-DDD
I learned assembler in one day, and start disassembling viruses.
That was the end of the beginning  :-D


IKX> In what languages can u code?

I can code in the following languages, listed in the order I learned them in:
Basic, Assembler, Pascal, C, Fortran, Ada.
But now i only code in assembler. :-)


IKX> You are not a very prolific coder, why?

I don't care about fame. I don't care if people critizes me or my code. Thats
why most of my projects dont get release.
I do alot of researching and begin coding interesting pieces of code, but I
only finnish a few of those projects. I'm simply too lazy to finnish them.


IKX> How much viruses have u coded? Give us their names.

My virii are, in order of appearance:

        * Small (vlad#5, 168 bytes)
        * Galindo (72 bytes)
        * Mariano (147 bytes)
        * Sexy (256 bytes)



IKX> What do u think about the AVers?

No comment. X-DDD
I don't care about them. They earn money and we help them.


IKX> Where from came those weirds optimization habilities?

They appeared from out of the blue. From the very beginning I coded optimized
code on-the-fly! Although my optimization skills have improved alot since
then. Now I'm a master! Wow!
I'm not the only master in optimization. Jacky Querty and Darkman are both
very good too. I like the way they optimize their code.


IKX> Give me your opinion about DOS and WIN viruses

DOS is the past.
WIN is the future.


IKX> Which viruses/coders/groups/zines do u like most?

I like original viruses, even if they ain't optimized  X-D
I like Griyo's and Jacky's viruses
I like 29A and IKX as groups
I like the 29A, IKX and VLAD e-zines


IKX> Besides writing viruses, do u have another hobby?

Watch TV and crack programs.


IKX> Tell me what do u think about the following topics

MACROVIRUS: only for lammerz.
VIRUS GENERATORS: only for lammerz.
POLY ENGINES: I like them alot.
DEBUG AND SOURCER: I love debug. I don't use sourcer.
TASM AND A86: my favorite compilers  :-)
SOFTICE: its my favorite debugger! I can't live without it! I love it!!!


IKX> OK, pal. Thank you very much for the answers. Now this space is 4 u,
you can fill it with the ASCII characters you want.

Greetings go this time to:
Int13h: thanks for the interview! my *best* internet friend!
Billy_belceb£: ­sigue por el buen camino de los virus!
Darkman: u r my hero  X-DD
Yesna: practice more spanish!
Nigr0: u r also a ring0 lover!

Also greetings to 29A members and to all virii writters
Im stoned now, so if i havent greet u, critize me at super_29a@mixmail.com
