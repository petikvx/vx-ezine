I was checking Xine#3 and I found that the 90% of the magazine is code and
tutorials:  asm  code here and asm code there. Then I said to myself: "why
not to do something different". I was thinking arround some days and fina-
lly  this  silly  article was born. This file was written just to give you
some  little  minutes  of  rest  of MOV EAX, Call SetFilePointer and INTs.
Here we will focus our eyes on a very interesting topic: those virus which
have relation with music & literature.We, virus writers, knows that a very
hard  moment  is when you have to put a name in your virus (if you haven't
done  it  already).  The  virus is there, finished, working, infecting and
fooling in the RAM, but it wasn't baptized yet, then it won't go to heaven
and  the  stupid  AVers will put some silly name to it, like 1906 or some-
thing  like  that.  Then, you think, and usually found a good name for the
beast.  Well,  the  Literature inspired the names of a lot of viruses. And
not only the name, lets read inside the AEMOBA:

                To see a world in a grain of sand,
                And a heaven in a flower
                Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
                And eternity in an hour.

                                     THE VIRUS 16/3/91

The virus VOID POEM also has a long poem inside it.

J.R.R.  Tolkien  is a sudafrican writer who wrote the trilogy "Lord of the
Rings".  A  wonderfull  and amazing book that you must read. The following
virus are Tolkien-related ones:

              * Frodo
              * Frodo Soft
              * Nazgul
              * Mordor
              * Morgul
              * Gondor
              * Gandalf
              * Mithrandir
              * Gollum
              * Smeagol
              * DarkElf
              * DarkLord
              * Tolkien

Other viruses based in some pages and writers of Literature are:

MACONDO, the town of the novel "One Hundred years of Solitudde" from
Gabriel Garc¡a M rquez, colombian writer, Nobel laureated.

QUEVEDO, the better conceptist writer of the Barroque School, spanish
genius, a real monster writing.

CAMILO, another Nobel laureated, the last giant spanish writer of the
century XX.

LITERATURA, obvious one.
POEM, ¡dem :)

Surelly,  there are more, but these are the ones I detected while checking
some  virus  enciclopedias.  Another thing that inspired a lot of names is
the music.But not only virus names, also nicknames for virus coders. Let's
remember Sepultura, Neurobasher and MrSandman. And in the other hand: 242,
Metallica, Helloween, Manowar, Cinderella, Anihilator, NKOTB, Iron Maiden,
etc.  and  talking  about  Iron Maiden, a lot of viruses from Dark Avenger
were inspired by this england group's albums.


-Where did you get that name, Dark Avenger? -asked Sara Gordon

DAV answered:
I  didn't  really "get" the name. I mean, I didn't call myself that. I put
those  words  in the virus and someone else (we both know who) said it was
written by the Dark Avenger.He's the one that made me be the Dark Avenger,
that name. I didn't use the name until after he called me that. That phra-
se  itself  came  from some old song from a long time ago, and not from an
Iron  Maiden song, like some people have said. In many ways, I suppose you
could say he made the Dark Avenger.

Yes,  efectivelly,  DARK  AVENGER  is a song from an album from MANOWAR, a
heavy  metal band. The song is in their first album called "BATTLE HYMNS".
And to finish this crazy article more insanelly here you have the lyric of
that song.

                      HE BROKE THE LAWS OF THE ELDERS
                        SO THEY BLOCKED OUT HIS EYE,
                         TOOK HIS LAND AND FORTUNE,
                              LEFT HIM TO DIE

                          BOUND ON THE SHORELINE,
                             LEFT FOR THE TIDE,
                       SEIZES LIFE, BLOOD LEAVING...
                      CIRCLING LOWER, THE VULTURES FLY

                          HIS BONES MAY BE BROKEN
                          BUT THE SPIRIT CAN'T DIE
                        AND THE GODS SEE HIS ANGUISH
                            AND GIVE HIM A SIGN

                        FROM THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN
                      THE SHIP OF THE LOST SOULS RISE
        AND THEY TAKE HIM WHERE NO ONE SLEEPS WHILE THE UNDEAD CRY,
                WHERE NO ONE SLEEPS WHILE THE UNDEAD CRY...

                           AND IN THE WORLD ABOVE
                              THE ELDERS SING,
                          ON HIS LAND THEY LIVE...
                            LET DEATH BELL RING

                                 NARRATION:
                      HE WAS MET AT THE GATE OF HADES
                     BY THE GUARDIAN OF THE LOST SOULS,
                        THE KEEPER OF THE UNAVENGED
                           AND HE DID SAY TO HIM:
                             "LET YOU NOT PASS
                                  ABANDON
                            RETURN TO THE WORLD
                             FROM ONCE YOU CAME
                              AND SEEK PAYMENT
                       NOT ONLY FOR THY KNOWN ANGUISH
                          BUT VINDICATE THE SOULS
                             OF THE UNAVENGED"

                        AND THEY PLACED IN HIS HANDS
                                  A SWORD
                                MADE FOR HIM
                             CALLED: VENGEANCE
                            FORGED IN BRIMSTONE
                                AND TEMPERED
                   BY THE WOLF IN TEARS OF THE UNAVENGED

                     AND TO CARRY HIM UP ON HIS JOURNEY
                          BACK TO THE UPPER WORLD
                             THEY BROUGHT FORTH
                             THEIR DEMON HORSE
                            CALLED: BLACK DEATH
                                A GRIM STEED
                             SO FIERCELY MIGHT
                            AND BLACK IN COLOUR
                  THAT HE COULD STAND AS ONE: DARKNESS...
                         SAVE FROM HIS BURNING EYES
                             OF GRIMS AND FIRE

                             AND ON THAT NIGHT
                           THEY RODE UP FROM HELL
                         THE POUNDING OF HIS HOOVES
                          DID CLAP LIKE THUNDER!

                                  CHORUS:
                        BURNING, DEATH, DESTRUCTION
                       RAPING THE DAUGHTERS AND WIVES
                         IN BLOOD I TAKE MY PAYMENT
                          IN FOUL WITH THEIR LIVES

                            NO ONE CAN ESCAPE ME
                           ON BLACK DEATH I RIDE
                   WHEN KISSED BY THE SWORD OF VENGEANCE
                     YOUR HEAD LAYS THERE BY YOUR SIDE
                  I TAKE THE LIVES OF ALL THAT I ONCE KNEW
                THE TORN FLESH OF A SLOW DEATH WAITS FOR YOU

                                  CHORUS:
                        BURNING, DEATH, DESTRUCTION
                       RAPING THE DAUGHTERS AND WIVES
                         IN BLOOD I TAKE MY PAYMENT
                          IN FOUL WITH THEIR LIVES

                       I SPARE THAT LAND OF SERVANTS
                         MY WAKE IS SLOW DEAD THERE
                      I TAKE THEIR WIVES AND DAUGHTERS
                    THEY STAND THERE WATCHING, WATCHING
                           HOPING TO GET MY LIFE
                BUT WHEN I'M THROUGH THEY KNOW THEY MUST PAY

                                  CHORUS:
                        BURNING, DEATH, DESTRUCTION
                       RAPING THE DAUGHTERS AND WIVES
                         IN BLOOD I TAKE MY PAYMENT
                          IN FOUL WITH THEY LIVES
                              WITH THEY LIVES
                              WITH THEY LIVES
