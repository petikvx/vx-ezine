The main purpose in life is, i think, to be happy.
The question would be then if we have enough time to annoy each other with
viriis. I'm not writing to the virus community, explaining why we are right
to destroy our neightboor's computer, i don't want to apologize for
writing virii, and i don't want victims to excuse us.
Some of you, Xers, try to explain that destruction is in nature, so that
we are completely right to destroy, but i don't think that the virii
purpose is in destruction. I don't agree with destruction, cuz i know how
a whole work can stand on a floppy, or on a hard drive, i know that computers
are not that cheap, i dunno why men try to destroy, but i suppose it's to
feel superior. erm.... wait. If i learn that a virii had burned my mother's
hard drives, i would be very annoyed, but if it was the McAffe, i would'nt
agree, publicly ;). (So, would the virus 'select' target hard-drives?)
I think that virusses are a kind of fight, a fight for fun, no death, no
blood, only winners and loosers. I think then that a virus that tell
'Happy birthday' each 25/6 is better than one that tell nothing but destroy
everything each 26/5...
After funning with that stuff, virii that can be, as ya know, very useful
weapons if well-used, can i think be used as that, i mean a weapons. As words
some times, but to use a weapons, you must have a conviction, a purpose.

What purpose?

If that purpose is the chaos on earth, go home and take a psy, i think
people like you haven't to walk free, put some chaos in your life,
leave your home go far away, take a deep breathe and spend your life
selling post cards... that'll be chaos like you want. except if you want
chaos for others, but not fer you!
Now if ya take a real purpose, like putting chaos, but somewhere precisely,
if you want to attack a part of the system you don't agree with, we then
would say you don't have a good purpose, but you have one, that's a great
step!
In life, i learn that to have good ideas is as important as to have good
ways to make them head, i think viriis are only carriers, they'll only
allow you to make what you want when you can use it; now, i'll never
agree with those who use it for killings, that's like martial arts, an
ethic part follow.
Now, i'm glad to see that only some virii are destructive, that most
agree with me, and i want to reassure people, virii writers are not all
weird, not all red-haired punks that want to make the USA nuclears to
head everywhere, even i think Xers are people like you, concerned by the same
politics problems, all that stuff you feel weak in front of. A lot of things
can be accessed by virii, i think they could be considered as a good weapon
cuz, more and more, they tend to be an intellectual game, or a
purposed-weapon.
I only hope i'm right, i only hope peoples ( in general, Xers and others )
would got a lot of purpose and stop trying to destroy everything anyhow.

There are my convictions, with is the fact that nobody agree with anybody
else every time - that's good i think - there are my hopes and my believings.
