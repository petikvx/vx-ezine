   Yes, virus.  This is the generic term in which we are boxed-in by those
   being that are our natural enemies: the anti-virus. They call us virus,
   and  they  kill  us and because of that, they are called anti-virus. In
   other  words,  I  am a virus, yes, a virus and my name is Wendell. When
   I  think  it  unprepared,  it  sounds  strange to me, but it shouldn't,
   since  inside  my  code  are  the instructions that say that I am named
   Wendell.  By  using  the  DB instruction, an unknown variable served as
   my  baptismal  font.  I  am  a runtime COM, EXE and SYS files infector.
   Although  I  must  confess  that  as regards the device drivers, I only
   verify  the  payload,  that  is  to  say,  I  ask  for  a random number
   between  0  and  255  (a simple one IN AL,40H) and if the byte returned
   in  AL  is  66,  then I print a message ont he screen. The message is a
   presentation  message:  in  the  top  part  of  the  monitor appears my
   origen,  my  name  and  that  of  the being that gave me life, the name
   of  my  god.  I  come  to life every time a file that I have previously
   infected  is  executed.  I've  already  gotten  tired of this matter of
   living  in  flashes,  only  when  a  program  in  which  I am lodged is
   executed.  I  would  like  to  be like Virus Alicia or like the Zhengxi
   in  order  to  be  able  to  infect  many different kinds of files, and
   to  be  able  to  reside  in  memory,  and  not  have  to live in short
   installments  as I am now, existing only for two or three seconds while
   the  program  in  which  I am situated is running. I would like to be a
   virus that resides in memory and allocates myself in the COMMAND.COM in
   order  to  exist whenever the machine is turned on and my cycle of life
   beings. Or  I would like to be a Boot Sector and Master Boot Record in-
   fector.  Although it does not  escape my awareness that it would be too
   much  work  to  be  like  Kuarahy  Virus  and have to infects disks and
   diskettes and diverse executable files. It would be too heavy of a task
   for  my strength, and in addition, I would be permanently alive, and it
   is  already  very  well  known  that  there is nothing so unbearable as
   eternal  life.  How  bitter would be life if there were not the hope of
   death!  Yes,  it  would be too unbearable, because all the time I would
   have  to attend to some request to open a file by means of the INT 21h,
   or  a  request  to  read a Sector 1, Cylinder 0, Side 0 of the diskette
   using  a  INT 13h.  I wouldn't like to be a overloaded work, but yes, I
   would  be  delighted  to  at  least be a resident COM, EXE and SYS file
   infector.   Perhaps  some  people  don't   know  that  viruses  have  a
   collective  consciousness,  a  common  spirit.  Whenever  an anti-virus
   eliminates  a  virus  from  the  warmnook  that  it occupies at the end
   of  some  executable  file, all of us viruses feel a common pain, since
   a  member  of  our  community  has  died. It is sad but it is true, due
   to  it  being  so  true  it  is sad. It is the struggle of good against
   evil;  virus  and  anti-virus,  it  is  always  difficult  to ascertain
   preceisely  who  are the good and who are the bad. We, the virus, stick
   ourselves  to  the  programs  in  order  to exist and we preserve their
   functioning;  more  than  parasitism  I  believe  that  is a symbiosis.
   A  friend  of  mine,  Virus  Galindo,  thinks about the existence of an
   Absolute  Creator  that  endowed  us  with  life,  someone who he calls
   EXECUTOR,  he  believe  this  and  also  believes  that the Executor is
   superior  to  the  particular  gods  that  gave life to each one of the
   virus. I  believe  that everything always existed, that everything was,
   is and will be always the same, that everything is static. Some viruses
   die and others are born, some are eliminated from all of the hard disks
   and  others are born to ocuppay their place, and yet others are endowed
   with  greater  capacities  for  survival in this savage world of bytes.
   This  is  what  I  think,  it  is  not my intention to influence anyone
   about  religion,  let  is be perfectly clear that is what I think and I
   alone.  It  would  not  be  bad to repeat now that I would like to be a
   TSR.  Well,  I was saying that all of us virus have a kind of invisible
   thred  that  unites us and we can feel it when pain or happiness enters
   the  life  of  other  beings of our species. Futhermore, in this moment
   moment  I  am  perceiving  the sensation of happiness radiated by Virus
   Hemlock  who  has  just  placed   a copy of himself in an .EXE file. At
   the  same  time,  I  recieve the dying signal of Virus Cerebrus who was
   recently expelled  from  his warm hidding place by some killer program.
   It  is  always  like this, something good, something bad, sometimes all
   bad,  sometimes  some  good  news.  One  has  to  be strong in order to
   stand  all  this  flood  of  sensations,  of  pleasant and dismal news.
   There  are  times  when  the  unfortunate  news  arrives repeatedly, my
   colleagues  die  in  mass  in far-away hard disks. It is something that
   one  has  to  get  accostumed  to. I am living now. Now I must look for
   .COM, .EXEs and .SYS for me to situate myself inside of them. The first
   thing that I do is call the 4eh function of the INT 21h, here it brings
   up  the name of a .COM, let's see, let's open it up, let's move AX into
   BX;  now  let's  move the pointer to the end, and compare. NO! I am not
   able  to  infect  it -it measures  only 145 bytes- and my morality code
   prohibits  me  to touch files that are so small, it would be rape, they
   should  have at least 1000 bytes. Well, let's see now about the .EXE...
   nothing,  and  nothing  so  far  as  the  .SYS also. There are not more
   infectable  files in this directory. It would be better if I continued.
   Some  of  my friends carry instructions in their codes in order to eli-
   minate  our  natural  enemies: the burnable anti-viruses. I ask myself,
   why  are  they  our  natural enemies? What harm do we do to them? Well,
   in  the  case  that  we  are  lodged in them, we usually preserve their
   functionality  without  any  problems,  but this was before; everything
   went  along  just  fine  until  it  occurred  to  them  to  become more
   complex,  due  to  those issues related to the natural evolution of the
   species  and  they  came  all  equipped  with  their  CRC  routines and
   self-check  modules.  And  then,  wheneverone of ours looked for asylum
   inside  of  them,  the  alarm  would  ring  and  indicate that the file
   had  been  modified,  and  the  execution  would  be ended suddenly, in
   drastic  fashion.  They  were  the  ones that decided to run with their
   eyes  blindfolded  in  a mined field. Why is it so difficult to live in
   peace  with  them?  The  hosts, on the other hand, are not aggressives.
   They  all  so  tamely  are  ready  to  give  us lodging, there  are not
   protest,  no  agression.  Everything is kindness. Well, one has to tell
   the  complete  truth;  there  are  some  that  refuse  to receive us...
   Generally  speaking,  they  are  those  that also self-test theirselves
   to  see  if  they  haven't  grown  some.  Those  are  the one that will
   atrophy,  because  one  needs  to  grow  and  improve oneself each day.
   That  which  is  stagnant  must  perish.  This life is good, but I find
   myself  to  be  quite  alone  and  I  can  think  on  my own (as I have
   already  said)  only  during  fractions  of  a  second. I would like to
   be  a  TSR  in  order  to  be  able  to  think  all the time, until the
   darknesses  of  the  non-being  return,  when the forces are exhausted,
   when  the  energy  that  impulses  of  small  universe  ceases  and the
   gigantic  sun  that  is  the  hard  disk ceases to spin around, and its
   arms  lose  the  gyrating  force  that  it usually brags so much about.
   But,  neither  is  it  good  when  there  are a lot of us; I remember a
   former  occasion  when  another  colleague of mine was in this machine.
   He  was  a  competitor,  he  infected  COM  and  EXE files and I had to
   dispute  host  sites  with  him.  There  were  times in which he placed
   a  copy  of  himself  inside  of  a  file  and  then I likewise did the
   same,  and  then  he  would  lodge  in  the  host  and  I couldn't find
   my  own  lodging  and  we  would  make  the file grow with inflationary
   numbers.  The  problem  lay  in  the  seconds,  due  to  the  fact that
   both  of  us  used  the  seconds  field of the hour of the last modifi-
   cation  of  the  program,  the  only  problem  being  that  we employed
   different values.
   Each  virus  has  its  god, the being that gives it life. I was progra-
   mmed  by  some  such  CJC;  I don't know him. I accuse him of irrespon-
   sable  parenthood,  because  he has never presented himself. As the son
   and  creation  of  his  that  I am, he should come up to me someday and
   say  to  me  "I am your father, son".  The  god that made Win32.Xine is
   named  JHB,  and the one that gave the breath of life to Padania_Libera
   was  named  B0z0.  There are viruses that do not bear the name of their
   creator-god  within their own code. I feel a little bit sorry for those
   viruses  because  it's  as  if  they  were  orphens. It must be sad not
   knowing  who  gave  you your life. This is my home, this is where I ac-
   quire  consciousness,  in  this  small  120 megabytes universe of mine,
   this  hard  disk  that  is  the star in which I undergo the development
   of  my  existence.  And  thanks  to  this  diskette  unit  I am able to
   prolong  my offspring toward other parallel universes, on other planes.
   I  know  this because there have already been times in which I have had
   the  emotion of feeling other colleagues situating theirselves in other
   files  in  faraway  universes,  and  the strangest thing about this was
   I  knew  with all certainty that "they were me", or in other words that
   it  was  I  who  was  infecting  the  files, but that they were copies,
   perhaps.  It  was  like  a prolongation of my consciousness. Describing
   this  is very difficult. Even and overwriting virus knows that routines
   are  our  ruin,  that  they  kill  our  wellbeing and creativity. I get
   bored  doing  the  same  thing  all the time. Always repeating the same
   script.  When  the  file  in  which I will take up lodging is a .COM, I
   read  the  first  three  bytes,  situate  myself in the end of file and
   write  a  jump  instruction  to  the  start of the host so that it will
   turn the control over to me upon execution of the command. When dealing
   with  an  .EXE  file,  I put myself at the end and I modify the header,
   the  CS:IP,  SS:SP,  size,  etc.  And  as regards the treatment of .SYS
   files,  I  position  myself at the end and change the strategic routine
   offset  so  that  I  myself can take control first, when the CONFIG.SYS
   is  read  and  processed.  It's  always the same. I would like to be as
   polymorphous  as  the  Uruguay  or  Marburg  viruses.  Those colleagues
   of  mine  surely  know  how  to  change their appeaance; they never are
   the  same  and  each  time  they take on a different form. This is good
   in  order  to  avoid  routine  and  boredom, that one should be able to
   manage  different  bodies  each  and  every  time  is masterful. I have
   already  since  once  before  that I would like to see a virus residing
   in  memory.  The  Camilo  virus  is  also  a runtime virus like myself.
   Everyone  knows  that  the  Dark  Avenger  virus  was  the first one to
   utilyse  the  Fast  Infection  Technique.  This  is  very  fine indeed,
   because,  why should  one  wait  until  the  programs whenever they are
   opened  or  copied?  Take  the instance of DIR-II, who is one member of
   our  community  that  lives  in  COM and EXE programs in a very special
   manner. My friend ByWay also uses this method, except that he is better
   equiped  for survival, with more advanced tools. There are some collea-
   gues  of mine that die on a certain date; they are like kamikazes, they
   die,  but  they  carry with them the entire hard disk. When the progra-
   mmed  date  arrives  and  being  situated within the memory, they write
   random  trash  all  over  the hard disk, leaving it unusable but at the
   same  time  they  write  random  characters  all over their own bodies,
   mutilating  themselves  or  disappearing  completelly.  I would like to
   be  a  virus  residing  in  memory  in  order to tunnel and to find the
   original  entry  point  of  the  21h  interruption and to thus mock the
   anti-viruses.  It  sounds  like tremendous fun. I know of colleagues of
   mine  from  the virus  community  that  find the original driver of the
   INT  21h  through  tracing  the  PSP.  Doing a runtime, my technique is
   extremely  slow;  I  can't  really  recommend it to anyone. Speaking of
   time,  I  believe  that  I have tarried enough. It's now time to return
   the  control  to  the host, since I have finished verifying this entire
   directory.  At  the  beginning  of  my execution I already returned the
   first  three  original  bytes to the host (which is a .COM). I put them
   back to the CS:100h position and I am already ready to make my leap and
   jump  there, but first I must restore the Critical Error Handler to its
   original  handler  and I must repoint the DTA to 80h... Right, check; I
   clear  the  registers, everything is all fixed, now I just want to make
   it  quite  clear  that  I  would like to be a virus resident in memory,
   I want to be  a  TSR,  I  hope  someday some programmer will get up the
   courage  to  modify  me and add on the skills to live in memory control
   blocks,  I hope that this will happen already in my next consciousness,
   because  now, I must die again, and wait in the darkness for the return
   of life...
   

                          MOV AX,100H
                          PUSH AX
                          XOR AX,AX
                          RET


   Post Scriptum: I want to be a TSR virus!
