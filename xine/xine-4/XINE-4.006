The virus-writer Grog appears on the Padanian and Italian virus scene in the
1992 and is active especially in the 1993, but not later.
In spite of his short activity, at the end of the 1993 Grog already produced
more than 50 viruses.
Still today the identity of this virus-writer is unknown and it seems that he
didn't further wrote any other virus, at least not using the name "Grog".
All his viruses were sent directly to a few antivirus researchers, maybe by
himself, by being uploaded in infected files, which were noticed as such, to
a Fidonet Bbs in Milan, in Lombardy, Padania, named "Euforia Bbs".

None of the Grog viruses has never been found in the wild nor has been found
in virus-trader's collections, so it is supposed that the only way of
distribution of his viruses was the Bbs one.
To be exact there is a known case of a Grog virus in the wild: there was an
infection of the virus Grog 3.1 in the United States somewhere in the 1996.
It is not known how wide the infection was, but it is probable that it
was originated by a copy of the virus that was downloaded from the Internet.
It is very unlikely that it was spreaded by the virus-writer since it took
place geographically very far and also 3 years after the virus was actually
written and distributed to the antivirus researchers.

The main peculiarity that is present in many Grog's viruses is the presence
in their body, sometimes displayed as payload sometimes not displayed, of
humoristic phrases from the Peanuts comics, from Snoopy's, Charlie Brown's
dog, attempts to write some popular novel that always turned out to be some
very funny failures. Also virus names are often taken from the Snoopy's novels
world and this made a small revolution in it's field. In fact if the
antivirus researchers were used to find magniloquent names like
"Dark Avenger", the arrival of this viruses with funny phrases gained
soon popularity.

Before the review of Grog's viruses I would like to express my regret for
the disappearing of this Padanian or Italian virus-writer, one of the most
promising and prolific ones. I hope the reason for his stop was a high
salary or a pretty girlfriend.
