 There are also some already compiled viruses in this package. To
avoid the possibility of somebody getting infected by accident we
packed all the files in a password protected ZIP. The password is
"ac1n0mx" (of course without the quotes). If you don't know how to handle
these viruses or you don't know what they may do to your and your friend's
computer please DON'T EVEN TRY to open the ZIP file.
 --> SO PLEASE PAY ATTENTION! <--

 We are not all from a country where the first language is English, so
please try to be a little comprensive when you find huge grammatical
errors in our zine. Of course we will try to write in a good English
but we hope that we wouldn't come out with 3l33+ +}{r453 l1|<3 +}{15 ;)))
