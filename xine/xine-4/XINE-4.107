INTRODUCTION
ßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Well. It is lame but someone has to do it. This is a semi-tutorial
about companion viruses. 16 and 32 bits companion viruses as you can
read in the title. Companion viruses are clasically written in high
level languages. Usually C or Pascal, because is harder to write
decent viruses in HLLs. But, lets remember Sentinel, a bulgarian
virus written by Lubo and Ian in Turbo Pascal, it is a TSR parasi-
tary and stealth.
Is easy to write a companion virus in assembler. The way of acting
is the following. If we have an EXE file and a COM with the same
name (test.com and test.exe) and in the command line we type:

C:\>TEST

DOS will execute the program TEST.COM, that is, DOS gives priority
to COM files. Companion viruses uses this advantage. This kind of
self-replicable code looks for an EXE file, creates a file with
the same name but with COM extension (with hidden attribute), then
writes the viral code to the created COM program. Then, when the
user types

C:\>TEST

the COM will be executed (that is, the virus), the virus will infect
other EXEs in the directory and when work is finished he will run
the real hoste, that is the program in currently execution but with
extension mutated to EXE.



COMPANION in 16 bits
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Under DOS we will use functions 4eh/4fh to get the name of EXE files
in the current directory. And the function 4bh to execute the original
wanted program, that is, our hoste. You must free some memory before
calling 4Bh, so pay atention where you put your SP. Following these
bytes its going a ultra-simple and lame companion virus:

COMPANION in 32 bits
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

Under Win32 we will use the following APIs to do our work:

     FindFirstFileA, FindNextFileA, MoveFileA, CopyFileA,
     GetCommandLineA, CreateProcessA, lstrcpyA

It is really easy. You can get the name of the file which is currently
running by calling the GetCommandLineA API. The name of the program that
is taking control now is the first argument in the command line, but it
is like this:

"program.exe" /D: /PARAMETERS /ETC

Why this? Lets quote to my friend Murkry:

      " What does this mean to us virii/hackers of win95?
        lets say we want to write a virus that adds info
        to the end of the host but does not modify the host
        PE header so while the info is there it is not loaded
        into memory. (A new LE/Macro infector works like this).
        Step one, we need the file name. Well check out the
        code below which will show a MessageBox with the file
        name in quotes when ran normaly, but will show the file
        name without quotes if in TD32 and I assume other debuggers
        (probaly not SI though). Be warn about this feature since this
        means if you are running a debugger to test, it will work
        differently, ie if you used this pointer to try and open the
        file it will fail since file "c:\filepath\foo.exe" is the
        file you will try to open not c:\filepath\foo.exe. "

I think that is the only tricky thing, just check the code bellow to
see an example companion virus.
