Some introduction words
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
 Finally back here to you for another issue of Xine. It took us about one
year from the second issue, quite a lot of time, but at least we hope that
the contents of this zine will repay the long awaiting.
 Some people even consider this group dead or something, some keep asking us
if we left or what. Nothing like this, we just have a lot of things to do in
our life, so we don't have always a lot of time to dedicate to what we would
like to. When we will have a lot of time work on h/p/v material all the day
long (or alternatively when we will be payed for it :) ) we will make came out
with more issues and more stuff. But that's enough with this... we don't care
about releasing big amounts of shitty stuff every day... so, people that would
like to see that from us can anyway consider us 'dead' :)
 A lot of things changed in IKX from the second issue. We have now two new
great members, Int13h and StarZero, with us and we are missing Gi0rgetto,
Beol and JHB (greets to MarkJ! :) ). But that is life, people have also a lot
of other things interests and things to do. Great news is that also Murkry is
now officially (but he already contributed with many things to the IKX work, so
he was missing just the official act of membership ;) ) an IKX member. So this
is with the news for the IKX team, not too large as usual and still looking
for new guys that would like to join and develop some interesting ideas and
projects and find some good friends to share ideas and problems with.
 An IKX rappresentance (me and KP) has also took part to the 6 day hacking
(but not only :) ) party in Holland, the HIP'97, and the experience was great,
a lot of interesting people to meet and a lot of things to learn, share and
talk about. A shame that there was quite no virii-scene rappresentance :( But
it seems that this summer a VX meeting (two?) organized by the 29A ppl will
take place in Europe (one in Spain and one again in Holland maybe) and at
least some IKX members are going to attend the event for sure. There isn't
actually too much exact infos to know about the date and place of this
meetings, but keep on looking for it by yelling the organizers on #virus on
the spanish irc network :) There seems to be also other meetings and such
around for the 1998 (for example one of these is HackIT98 near Florence in
june) so if you'll keep your eyes opened you should come across some of us.
Alternatively just come here and we will have nice talk, expecially if you
bring something good to drink ;)
 As for the contents of Xine#3. There is quite a lot of material, really. A
lot of new stuff (techs and code) for the various platforms (from the old DOS
to Win16 to Win32). But you'll see and you'll have to judge. Even if IKX from
the very beginning stands as a H/P/A/V group also this issue is quite entirely
(with just a few small exceptions) dedicated to viriis, as the actualy IKX
crew is mainly composed by virus writers and the few hackers (or part time
hackers :) ) have been busy and too lazy (hey KP! ;)) ) lately. But this is
not a problem, the main goal is to develop something new and to keep something
going on, so the H/P sections should be more developed in the future when we
will get some ideas to work on. Packed with this issue you'll find also all
the compiled viriis as well as some compiled samples from the various tuts and
some older stuff for the collectors (such as the original WM.Padania virus,
that has actually been also composed badly by some collector around, so AVP
scans another virus as the WM.Padania and will more likely call this one in
another nonsense name as AVP usually does, but who cares anyway?).
 Something else to write about? Err... mmm, the VX scene? Well, what should
I say, more or less the same as I always said or as other people say :) The
scene is alive and from time to time it brighten up with the outcoming of
some zine or of some new cool release. Nothing special, but is anyway very
nice to see that the various groups are doing respectively their work well
and that there are some new young enthusiast newcomers that are approaching
the virus world. But since IRC still exist people are still losing time
there instead of coding, heh :)
 What about AVs? Always the same shit, more or less. They are pubblicizing
their shitty products all around (even IRC sometimes) instead of developing
some really interesting new techs and improvements to their products. But
since the number of people that miss a brain using a computer is fastly
growing it is also quite normal that AV companies just care to make money.
It is actually interesting the reaction of some AVers when you seriously try
to discuss personally (I did on IRC and via mail a few times) problems or bad
aspects of their products: they usually act as five aged schizo childs or at
worse try to explain you that even the other AV has the same problem or
something :) Nevertheless, continue selling that shit and enjoy your money
if you can't do something better.
 So what's next... well, great thanx to everyone that contributed to this
issue of the zine in some way, with an article, a virus, a disassembly or
just even with some ideas or with some moral support :) A special greeting to
Dandler that coded us the zine reader (since some people told us with
feedbacks that it was really missing in the previous zines :) ) and to Insane
Madness for the final IKX logo.
 What about the future? Who can say. We will try to continue developing stuff
for the H/P/A/V world so expect to see still around the IKX marker. Some of
us already started working on some stuff for Xine#4, but maybe it is a little
too premature to say something about it, hehe :) If you wanna contribute
something for it just send.

 Just enough for now... keep on reading Xine#3 and remember to send some
feedback with your comments so we should improve the next as the readers ask
us to! We all hope you'll enjoy this magazine as we did at writing it!

Greetings,
