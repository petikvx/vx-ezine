                      Outsider2 virus by Vecna/29A

Here is the algorithm of my Outsider2, the last of the serie that I have
written. It has polymorphism, infects EXEs and COMs, converts his entry
in the root dir to volume label, in order to stops the access to DOS
functions and like all the others members of Ousider family, this has
a magnific payload... :)
The algorithm is descripted here because I saw that are very rare the
viruses using this technique. Only Dir2, ByWay and Ousider use it. Dir2
and ByWay uses a different method, based in the manipulation of the
DOS control block for disks. Outsider is the only one that uses the
int 13 directly to do its job. Outsider can use like a vector for
spreading to all antiviruses, including those that uses his own file
engines, like TBAV.

1. The virus body is decrypted, with a simple polymorphic routine,
that changes the registers used.

2. The virus calls the routine anti-trace(25), to avoid emulation
of the virus code. The routine returns a 3 only if anybody is
emulating the code.

3. Some variables are initialized, like the values for the encryptation,
and the number of directories to read before the hooking of the int 13,
if the virus is in a boot sector.

4. The virus verifies if exists a PSP. If it didn't exists, that means
that the virus is in a boot sector, then it jumps to 10.

5. The virus calls int 13 to test if it is already resident. The only case
in which the virus can be read and be already resident is when it is in
a damaged host, that, for example, was copied without the virus resident.
If it is already, jumps to 8.

6. The infection of the HD is called(14) and the int13 is hooked(12).

7. The date is verified, and if three months have passed between today
and the day when this host was infected (that is calculated in 10),
we jumps to our payload(24). If it isn't, jumps to 9.

8. The virus code modifies some instructions, then the virus instead
of reexecution will erase itself. We don't want to have copies easy
to examine over there ;)

9. The virus searchs its name in the environment, frees memory, and
then re-executes(erases) and stays resident(exits to DOS). Because
the int13 is our, the virus won't be viewed. If it is realized, 5
will detect and will erase it.

10. We read the MBR at 0:7c00. We just infects floppies, but we
continue the booting from the HD, then the user won't see that
he is doing a crap (booting with a strange disk).

11. We adjust the memory of the int12, we copy ouserlves, and we go to
TOM (Top of Memory). The stack is 0:7c00, then a RETF will give us
the original MBR.

12. Here we hook the int13, manipulating the IVT. A RETF returns to
MBR or to the code of the file that called us.

13. In this sub-routine we create the polymorphic decryptor, we copy
and encrypt the virus in a buffer.

14. Here we infect the hard disk. We try to open the file 0xff, and if 
we are sucessfull, we take the inicial cluster using SFT. Otherwise,
we calculate the month of activation, the value for encryption of the
pointer to the original clusters. Then, we create the virus in the root
dir, we write the code, and then the we examine SFT.


    [***BUG***]

     Sometimes, the virus, won't be able to open the file 0xff because it
is marked as VOLUME LABEL. Then, another copy will be created. But there
isn't problem, because in the next boot, only the first copy will remain,
and the other ones will be erased. But the files infected by this copy,
which have a different cluster than the volume label, will stay destroyed.
Well, generally, in the first boot, Outsider2 infects *ALL* the disk,
for that reason that copy with wrong information about the clusters,
probably only will infects floppies, that doesn't use the cluster
 number... ;-)
     And, if the virus is volume label, that means it already infected the
root dir. Then the COMMAND.COM sure is infected. Then why the virus isn't
resident?? People that try to boot by floppies and next executes something
in the hard disk are to fool and deserve to have their files destroyed... :-)

15. When the reading of a floppy, we come here. If is the boot sector and it
isn't infected yet, we calculate, using the BPB, the last sector of the
floppy root dir, and we copy ourselves there, encrypted. This let us
capabilities to infect floppies of all sizes, from 360kb to optical floppies
of 20mb!! The boot sector is overwriten with a loader for the virus code, and
the original boot, used for stealth, goes to the root dir.
Now we read that sector, where is the original boot, in the buffer of the
caller. Then, we have always stealth, because the infected disks have thee
their original information.

16. My int28 handler. This handler calls to infectdrive(14) and unhook itself
from int28. We use this because we need to DOS for the creation of our file
in the root dir, but we need only to call int21h while DOS isn't using it,
and not in the middle of an int13.

17. This is the main routine of the virus, the int13 handler. It calls the
routine anti_trace(25), and goes to 15 if is an operation with floppies.

18. We verify if the sector that is viewing/written is a directory, verifying
32 entries, looking for "EXE" or "COM" in the right place. That maybe looks
that a not very good check, but if isn't a directory entry, it will rebound
in the next checks.

19. If we are using the int28, we won't infect, we just will do stealth. If
weren't read the enough number of sectors of directories (we are in a
floppy), the counter is decremented and we do stealth(23)

20. If is time to infect the HD(we are in a floppy), we hook int28 and jumps
to stealth(23)

21. Now, in a loop, we verify all the entries of that sector, which have a
directory. If is my file 0xff, is converted to volume label. If is an EXE or
COM, and isn't a file that we can't infect (EXE files that will be loaded as
driver by CONFIG.SYS), we infect it.

22. The infection consist in set the read-only attribute, encrypt the
original cluster and set our, save the size of the file and set our, and set
our mark. But, before we verify if the entry is free, because win95 uses it.
Now, the modifications are written to disk.

    The read-only attribute is necesary, because, otherwise the virus can be
overwritten while copying a file, destroying its copy in the root. If is read-
only, the user must use CHMOD or another program, that will be infected, and
when going resident, it will activate the full stealth. ;-)

    We set our size in the place of the host's size because our virus, when
is read, acts like a COM. And if is an EXE, can't exceed 64kb or we will have
an error. ;-)

23. Here we disinfect the directory entry recently read, to hide the virus.
And if the entry has our mark, we arrange all the data like it was before
our infection. But these modifications aren't written to disk, then we
have full stealth.

24. This is the payload, that surely is the causant of lot of phone call to
technics. Consists in put a password in the POST section of the boot, in the
CMOS. Then, every time when the computer is turned on, the password will be
required.

    To begin, with 1/4 probability, we prints in the screen the virus's
copyright, and some lines more. Then in the ROM we look for the marks
of AMI or AWARD. Differents routines takes control to set the password,
depending of the manufacturer.  Those BIOSes are the common ones, and
are used for 90% of the machines. The password is random, and the checksum
is corrected. Then, the machine hangs up in an infinite loop, with the
interruptions deactivated, to avoid a simple CTRL+ALT+DEL. The user must
press reset, that gives him more work :P

25. The anti-trace routine verifies the stack, and if it founds problems,
it jumps to payload(24). This routine prevents that a tunneler, except
emulators, pass the virus.

     And here is the source of Outsider2. I must thanks to Eternal Maverick
of SGWW, that helped me to betatest this virus, and is always a source of
inspirative ideas.
