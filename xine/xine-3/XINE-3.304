                        Virus Spotlite: Lilith
                      by b0z0/iKX,  Padania 1998

Virus Name      : Lilith
Origin          : Milan (Padania), 1995
AV Name         : Lilith
Type            : Boot/MBR infector, full stealth on MBR, semipoly
Lenght          : 1536 bytes (+ variable lenght semipoly loader)

Introduction:
ФФФФФФФФФФФФФ
 This is a quite old but very interesting Padanian boot virus. Lilith is
the first boot virus that implemented the 18_tech (so redirecting the int13h
vector to a 'CD18', int 18h, opcode in ROM and then hooking int 18h. Check out
Dandler's article in Xine#2 for everything about this method) so it is fully
windoze compatible thus no silly messages appears at loading while the virus is
present. Apart this Lilith many other interesting features: disables boot virus
protection on AMI bioses, creates a semipoly loader that will load at boot time
the real body of the virus, it's full stealth on MBR, checks if probably another
boot virus on the target (so preventing conflicts), has a payload and other
things. It is well coded, with clear and interesting routines.
 It is a shame that the virus has a quite strange bug in the loader generation
routines, since without that bug I think it should really have good chanches
to stay in the wild (go read about its story in Dandler's article in this zine).
The bug is not just coder's fault, but is due to some brain-damaged checks on
some BIOSes.

General tech aspects:
ФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФ
 When the virus will get control from the mutating loader (more about this in
the next section) it will store the original int13h vector and then get 2kbs
of memory (by substracting from [413h]) and copy itself up there. If the
condition for the payload activation is satisfacted (the lowest nibble of
the timer is 1100b) then the virus will hook Int 05h (print screen). Anyway
the virus will search for the 0cd18h in ROM (starting from 0f000h:0000)
and then will redirect the Int 13h to the founded opcode in ROM. Also Int 18h
will be hooked of course. After this the virus is ready to infect new floppyes,
but before leaving the control to the old boot (or MBR) the virus will try to
infect MBR and then load the original boot.
 Nothing special till now, but the interesting stuff comes now. When the int
handler will see an interesting function (read/write on boot or mbr) it will
try to infect the victim. If the function is done on MBR then the virus will
check if it is already infected and if so it will return the original MBR. If
it isn't infected of course the virus will infect it. When a floppy is the
victim the virus will check if the data in the BPB of the floppy seems
interesting, thus bad or unformatted floppyes won't be infected. This checks
are quite simple (comparations of the bytes per sector, sectors on disk,
sectors on track and sides with some given stable values) but effective. Also
the usual check for the 55aah as the last two bytes of the sector will be done.
Another check is now done on both MBR and floppy: check for probable other boot
virus. Lilith will search the sector for three quite usual strings founded
in boot viruses that are:
        mov     word ptr [413h],ax
        dec     word ptr [413h]
        sub     word ptr [413h],xx
This check is quite simple, but is able to prevent some conflicts with many
other boot viruses.
If all the checks are ok, then the virus will calculate where to store its
body (3 sectors) and the original boot sector on the disk. On MBR infection
the place for this 4 sectors is stable, while isn't stable on flopppy disks.
The virus, using the data founded in the BPB, will calculate the place for
itself on the last four sectors of the last track on the last side of the
floppy. With this interesting way the Lilith won't have problems with different
floppy formats. It is very interesting that the same routine that is used to
find the place where to place the body is also used in the restoration part of
the virus. Infact when the virus will have to read the old boot it will have to
recalculate the position where it stored the original boot and will use again
the same routine (that will also check again that the boot is still intact,
no other viruses there and so on).
Saved the main body and original boot the virus will create the poly loader,
that will load at the boot the body of the virus that will be placed on the
calculated position on the disk. But I'll talk more deeply later about this
part.
When the loader is done to prevent warnings to the user the virus will disable
the AMI bios boot virus protection, write the boot/mbr with the loader and then
restore the settings of the cmos. And finally the control will be returned back
to the interrupt caller.
Finally some words about the payload. The virus will hook Int 05 (the print
screen), so most likely when the user will press the PtrSc key this routine
will be activated. The virus will set the screen to 40x25 mode, clear it
and then display its message on given offsets on the video. When the entire
message will be displayed its color will be changed. This will be done by
changing the color register R/G/B components. Each color component should
either be modified in the loop (inc or dec at each evolution) or be stable.
This choices are done somewhat randomly.

Mutating loader generation:
ФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФФ
The routine that creates the mutating loader that gives control to the virus is
very interesting. What it must basically generate is the code to jump from the
beginning of the boot (0:7c00) to the rest of the routine (skipping the BPB),
setup the stack (so SS:SP will be 0:7c00), set the ES register to 0 (as CS and
SS), the BX register to 7e00h, set the CX and DX registers so they point to
the virus body stored on the floppy (MBR), set AX to a read for three sectors,
execute and Int 13h and then jump to the loaded virus body (0:7e00h).
Of course some things (like the CX and DX and AX assignation for the disk read)
can be done in a random way, but some need a specific order.
To make all this easyer the virus uses some tables with some internal
pseudocommands. In this way when the loader creation routine will get a given
command byte will know how can this be done. The lower nibble of the byte
will be used as an added parameter, while the high nibble is the real command.
Let's see the complete table of commands:

  0000b  =  0xh  = just skip
  0001b  =  1xh  = jump directly to the value in BX
  0010b  =  2xh  = copy CH bytes from DS:BX to ES:DI
  0100b  =  4xh  = do all the elements of the table at DS:BX in the given order
  1000b  =  8xh  = do just one from the table at DS:BX
  1100b  =  Cxh  = do all the elements of the table at DS:BX in a random order

So what is the use of all this? When main routine (process data) will get one
of this "commands" it will call another routine that do the given set of
instructions. So at the very beginning the routine will get a 047h, since it
will have to create all the 07h important stages (they are the jump, the
initialization of AX and a cli, the stack set, the es set, the registers set
for the read, the int13h execution and the jump to the virus). It will also be
supplied with a table with the adresses to this 07h stages. The routine will
get the first adress and check which command is there, that is a 82h with a
table of two adresses. So the routine will have to select one (the 8xh command)
of the two ways (the x2h) of creating the first jump over the BPB. Since each
of this two adresses for the way of creating the jump point to a 1xh then the
routine will simply jump there and so create the initial jump. Then the routine
will pass to the second important stage. Here we have a C2h, so the routine
will consider both the elements of the table, but in random order.
And so on, hope you got the idea of how it works. Check out the code, is clear
and commented enough to make a fast idea on how it works, but it is rather
strange to describe with words :)
In this way the routine will select (where possible) between a set of
instructions that do some needed work (for example to make AX became zero the
VW put 5 ways to do so) and in a random order (again, where possible... of
course you can't first code then jump to the virus body at 0:7e00h as the
first thing, hehe :) ).
The routines are quite interesting, since there is some sorta internal code to
create the loader, really fun and goodlooking code. Of course the possible
mutations of the loader are quite limited and it should not be too difficoult
to spot nowadays, but, again, the code is rather interesting.
And finally to the sorta bug of the virus that is included just in the code
generation. This isn't just a real virus bug, but rather a dummy check of the
BIOS programmers. Infact many BIOSes when will see a a JMP SHORT (opcode 0EBh)
as the first byte of the boot sector will check if the third byte is a NOP
(opcode 90h). If this third byte isn't a NOP they will just stop there,
claiming the floppy is not valid. As you can spot from the code the virus
doens't put a NOP there, but a 00h :-( So when an infected floppy will be used
on such a shitty BIOS, the system will just hang there :-((( Really a shame
for such a interesting virus, really :-(

Well, that's all, greetings to the author of the Lilith and thanx to Dandler
for some very important hints ;)
