                  The Schumrz algorithm of genetical mutation
                        And its possible applications
                     Once again by [Star0]a.k.a.[Unkm/Ikx]



 I was two weeks ago at the university with my class ,  there was a lot of
 stand I look from there to there , when I saw the Shurmz stand, there was
 a sillicon grafx running with the shurmz game 

 What are the shurmz ? Shurmz are pretty little ants who search food ,like
 Sim ant , the new stuff is that they can mute their specificity , there's
 six or seven specificity like speed , force , intelligency , resistance ,
 reproduction etc etc...

 The game is simple,you have two colony ,black and white,if an ant doesn't
 find enough food,she dies,an ant can die also when two ants fight and she
 lose the round.There begins social-genetical mutation , if the colony one
 begin to have more force,so only ant who have speed and force 'll survive
 in the colonny 2 ,  and the reaction of the colony two is to produce more
 child with a good force and a pretty speed . Nice no ?

 The most  interesting things  in their stand was the shurmz  algorithm of
 genetical  mutation  when reproduction  came  , in that  case you  have 3
                                        important steps :
    ÚÄ Reproduction ¿
    ³       ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿           1ø Selection  , establish the best
    ³       ³   Selection   ³           person who  can respond  perfectly 
    ³       ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ           at a present problem, in some word
    ³       ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿           the most adapted at the situation,
    ³       ³ Crossbreeding ³           this person'll  have more children
    ³       ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ           than other 
    ³       ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
    ³       ³   Mutation    ³           2ø Crossbreeding   ,   this   step
    ³       ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ           consists  to pick  the best of two
    ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ                   persons like sexual reproduction ,
                                        generating an individual person

 3ø Mutation ,  may be the most  complex thing in  their algorithm  ,  the
 mutation scheme is  at my vision  chaotic  , randomic  . But there can be
 mathematical , dunno how , but this may more possible .  So the  mutation
 generate some gene  randomic , in that case there's two possibility , die
 or live , when the life live , there's new gene  that can help / handicap
 if the person is handicapped by this gene ,so this gene  is skiped in the
 crossbreeding , can be ignored at the step 1 and it dies completely, gene
 lost  .  But in case of help , the gene  will be spread over a maximum of
 people over generations

 Interrest for VX ?

 Sure , mutation  is a sweet dream for all vx writer , the idea that a Com 
 infector mute  himself  into a winexe infector is really pretty but kinda 
 impossible,mutation  are too complex to be applying on a virus,and anyway
 the number of mutation is so high  to be capable to see if anything where 
 changed, and if we  increase the number of genes who mute each time,we'll
 have too  many handicaped children  and the  colony  goes to death , but 
 there's a pretty application of this scheme into virus comportement ,like
 how many infection  per process , type  of  infection ( if per process or 
 goes resident ) which  platform ( if there are many ) ,this gene can mute
 a lot , look , if any stupid aver want  test yar virus with a lot of bait 
 file,the infection rate'll  descend a lot and goes to 1/8 , why ? because 
 the virus adapt himself on  external modifications , analysis become more
 and  more difficult  because viruses  are placed on unusal environments ,
 and in this case the virus give  reaction to rest in a kinda normal state
 ,but when the virus'll  return on a normal machine , his reaction returns
 normal ,normal from the enviroment  now imagine that the virus  encounter
 a new kind of his virus branch 

 The virus from left is a lame  comexe  and the virus from right is a good
 exesys what's happend? a new  virus born,it's an comexesys who he'll kill 
 all his fathers and mothers and  take their place , there's the bad point 
 of computer virus , they don't know the natural death , it's a primordial 
 point in the  biological evolution ,only perfect virus can never die ,but
 you know that nobody is perfect . Return on the virus crossing problems . 
 The  first problem  is if the comexe are really  too bad and 'll handicap 
 the  comexesys . It crash over the virus,or is detected by an antivirus , 
 think that the comexesys  have  already killed all comexe and sysexe . So 
 the colonny  have  suicided  itself , it's stupid , and the nature give a
 good reponse  against this problem  : dissimination . The comexesys don't 
 replace all his parents by himself ,but 1/3 father,1/3 mother 1/3 child , 
 and if the comexesys  goes right , his parents population goes down , the 
 best adapted'll survive. The second problem is how to detect that the exe 
 infection from good exesys is better than the lame comexe , the best idea 
 is to define a protocol for viruses, and define infection level,low equal 
 lamah ,  high equal good ,  in this case ,  viruses can choose with which
 routines they can use, too bad  level can be prohibed, any other solution 
 of  this  problem  is  welcome  .  The third  and  last  problem  is  the 
 imcompatibility between some kind of  infector,a com and a win32 infector 
 can't couple themself, in  solution of this problem,you can create bridge
 of compatibility from system1 to system2 . 

 An  important rule  is that  the family must respect a minimum of rules ,
 like active  detection , or let's a better  virus install  himself at his 
 place, already infected detection , etc etc otherwise that crash.The best 
 idea I  think is to  apply the  concept on  polymorphic  engine , they'll 
 always  modify  themself  ,  so  when an   antivirus  have  defeated  the
 polyengine1 ,  he have already muted himself in  anything different , and 
 life continue . In this case , viruses becomes allways better and better, 
 and  always  couple old  tech and  new  technology ,  there also  appears
 populations of kind of viruses,in this case appaers also complex movement 
 of infections , see automata
