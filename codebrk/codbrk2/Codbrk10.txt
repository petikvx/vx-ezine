When it comes to hacking, knowing where to find utilities is half
the battle.  Here is a list of sites that you should check out.
Download and experiment with the utilities that are presented.  In
future issues, we will be profiling specific hacking programs
along with actual results of using them.

Most of this links were copied from the book MAXIMUM SECURITY.
This is a 885 pages book about all kinds of security (and how to break them).
