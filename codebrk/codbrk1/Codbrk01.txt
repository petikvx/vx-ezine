	Welcome to the first edition of the Codebreakers virus magazine/tutorial.  This magazine 
has many purposes and features, but the most important one is to teach beginners how to write 
successful virii.  There are many problems that are currently facing the virus community, such as 
the hostile environments of the new operating systems and the ever increasing advances in anti-
virus software.  The virus community as a whole has taken many bad hits in recent years and, 
unfortunately, never completely recovered.  We, at Codebreakers, feel it is our duty to step in and 
stimulate the underground community and hopefully entice people to enter the exciting world of 
virus writing.

	The outline and curriculum of our magazine is designed in such a way that if you read 
each article from beginning to end starting with our first edition, I guarantee that you will learn 
how to code virii.  You will find that many of the articles will not only contain tutorial 
instruction, but commentaries as well from members of the Codebreaker virus group which will 
aid in the general understanding of the psyche of the virus writer.  On the other hand, some of us 
are so damn crazy that I'm not sure how deep you want to get into our minds.  Seen the movie 
Scanners?  People's heads blowing up...get the picture?  Seriously, please read everything that 
we have put in these magazines.  If you don't, you might not qualify for the money-back 
guarantee.  We will try to add some humor from time to time to make it interesting.

Disclaimer:  Fuck disclaimers, wake-up!!!!!  This is a VIRUS writing magazine!  No, seriously, 
if you follow all instructions, you will have nothing to worry about.  DON'T be scared of virii!  If 
you plan on writing and using virii, you must not fear them.  You will, however, need to respect 
them.  Follow the instructions that I give you and you'll live.  I'm trying to bring you into the 
virus community, not turn you off by fucking your system.

I want to see everyone writing virii soooo much that I'm even going to include the software 
necessary to compile and launch your first creation.  The included files in this magazine are 
TASM.EXE and TLINK.EXE.  By the way, all code written in the articles, unless specified, will 
be TASM friendly.  I hate MASM and most other microshit products.

I would like to point out that this is our first edition.  In the future, we plan to add menus and 
hypertext to the magazine, but to expedite the release of the first edition, we decided to keep the 
format simple, individual text files.  There are also virus writing utilities and a fully functional 
virus within the Cdbkutl directory.  See the readme file and the end of Lesson 1 for an 
explanation of the included files.
