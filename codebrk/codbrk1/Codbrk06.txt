	You disgust me; you stupid wannabe.  Do you even know how to turn a computer on?  
Did your mommy and daddy buy you one for Christmas?  If I ever catch you on the Information 
Super Highway, I will run you off the road.  Look at the genius hacker go.  Boy, you sure do 
know your way around a computer.  WOW!  You figured out what CPU stands for.  Of course I 
know how to ftp.  You probably can't even spell ftp.  You don't know anything.  What?  Do you 
think you are a hacker just because you downloaded some programs that can figure out 
passwords?  Well, you're not.  You are nobody.  You will never be a hacker and you will never be 
like me.  I don't have to prove anything to you.  I could if I wanted to though.  I know all there is 
to know about hacking and cracking.  I have always been a hacker.  I was born writing my first 
virus.  I could send you an email that would cause your computer to shut down permanently if I 
wanted to.  I can hack into a bank computer and take as much money as I want, whenever I want.  
The only reason you can even get on the Internet is because I let you.  I never had to learn how to 
hack.  I could always do it.  Nobody ever had to show me how to do anything so I am not going 
to show you.  I am not a lamer like you.  I am not a wannabe.
