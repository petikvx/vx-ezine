Opic's extends his over-extended Greetings to:

-Spo0ky: For not tweaking everytime I pressed the release date back, and for
         being my one man support team, can you get an 800 number?  ;-)

-Lord Natas: For teaching me how to disappear, and being a good friend. 

-VicodinES: Peace bro, with every poppy you could ever dream of...
            *Look for the CB5 image made by vic hidden somewhere in this 
             viewer*

-Device: Thanx fer all yer help and patience on the viewer, not to mention
         a r0kin win32 tut.

-J.S. Bach: Thanx for the backwards femme' fa'tal counseling ;-)

-Evil-E: A great addition to CB

-Landing Camel: My man on the java train, i wanna see some virulent remote 
                infectors soon like you promised!

-Horny Toad: Defcon huh? what about that job offer? :-) Glad your back bro.
             Disappear again and I'll personally hunt yo ass down!

-Evul: one hundred thousand thanx.

-Rhape79: watchin yo back.

-Gbyte: watch out boys, this sister Vxer is kicking ass and taking names!

-nucleii: the man who loves to hate....everything.

-Spanska: sorry about the #vir incident. Glad to hear about your little move. 

-The hords of other Vxers I have come to know and love.

-29a, SLAM, DDT, UC, NMVT, TI, IKX, and all you other Vx groups.

-The Vx community: 

may all your borders be pourous, free transmission, 
smear genetics c'est la vie!

-Joel McNamara: 

thanx for the positive renforcment on Caligula: Locked eyes; shared plan, 
no c.i.a., could understand; defile, define, critique and salve.  

-C.I.H.: I hope they dont turn you into dog food (I hear tai's are crazy like
         that).

-AOL: log this --> Fuck You.

-The Media: Reaching for your wallets like hand to holster....

-Fred Cohen: 

ahistorical; you think this shit just dropped right out of the sky. 
my analysis: it's time to harvest the crust from your eyes 

-Intelserv: ....like a mouth too late to shut.

-Richard Smith: 

Why do you keep visiting my page? you wanna glean some more
GUID's? Such a hipocryte ;-) One day your sucking up press
and bitching M$ out over "your" discovery of GUID's, the
next day your using them to screw people over. They have a name
for people like that you know......Play fair, or at least take a 
bath b4 your next photo shoot. 

-ICSA: 

Theres somthing acting on this body. Something goes in when nothing comes out
and someones acting on this information, but nothings registered from this
location. From this site, that I am, in asking....How big is my profile now?
(I wanted a language of my own)

-The A.V. community: 

i am a message prescient, forecasting there is a limit, 
so take my temperature, you say: "your turn", but i think, 
the invite's open to all, so come on take your medicine, 
hey doctor heal yourself, or do you got too much to lose? 
you are a message precious, extracting forging a tactic,
to get your motion through, you say: "don't know, not sure", but i think, 
no holster's empty for you, so come on take your medicine, 
hey doctor heal yourself, or do you got too much to lose? 
shoot out and shoot out the window

-FBI: 

A *swat* team? What do you think David L. Smith was, armed with floppy disks?   

-Barlev: 
 
You start a conversation, you can't even finish it. You're talking alot;
but your not saying anything. When I have nothing to say; my lips are sealed.
Say somthing once, why say it again?

-Stephen "from Indiana": Sorry for any trouble you may have had, might I 
                         suggest a nice slander suit against barlev?  

-Sarah Gordon: Thanx for all the refreshing and challeging conversations 
               we've been having. 

-Guy Picciotto: My ghost writer perhaps? ;-)

-"The 'Ex' that wouldn't die": Sorry's just a no shit sherlock mouth talk 
                               con job.

-"That one girl" (who never called): 

your eyes like crashing jets, fixed in stained glass but not religious,
you should pay rent in my mind, say like the french say; 
bon soir regret, a demain, do you like me? i guess.
white witness moves to petition, the state of virginia for 27 prisons,
while in bethesda an office flaming, youth group singing, 
firemen calling in, lockheed lockheed martin marietta,
end of the lesson, time for one question: do you like me?

--David L. Smith: 

here's an all new version, teeming with distractions; 
trojan horse rolled backwards, mastered by your own device 
then splice, in then cut, to the sad sorry image of some grinning 'caster 
staring at a sinkhole, piling up disasters, making the footage raw 
now parade the muscles, trying to make their dicks grow 
warring with their bodies, dimensions oversold; 
"i wonder if i pierce it will my body stop lying to me?" 
now mouthing mile a minute, blasting like a furnace, fogging up the lenses 
with the dampness of spew; 
loss of concentration/ loss of obvious/ laws of stimulation/ signed anonymous 
it's a stock set up, man check it out! a well worn cop's shoe's 
kicking out a door frame classwar extra PR'ing like a foreman's dog 
"what a slob, but i guess you know, he's got to make a living somehow" 
tossing a wild eyed greaser, right onto the pavement 
scanned into the bright light, maxing the pixels to glow
how did it come to mean nothing but this?

J.S. Bach's Greetings:

Hello to all the codebreakers and virus lovers.
Special thanx to Spooky, without whom the polymorphing of my code branches 
would be impossible.
Special thanx to Opic as well for his general ideas on polymorphism.

Thanx to Anaktas for the new ideas on using Turing equivallent code on my 
decryptors. When time permits I will implement his ideas.

To all the rest of the codebreakers, hope you have not been intimidated by 
the recent scare with Melissa and Papa.

Keep up the good work and PRODUCE!!

My site has been down for some time, but I will open a new one up.
Keep an eye on codebreakers.

HT, where the heck are you? After 1 year you still haven't authorized my 
ICQ. That's what I call a "delay".

Opic, fix your sleeping hours :*) Spooky can design a schedule for you.

Cheers
JSB
