<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>Welcome to Strange
Brew, an illustration of the security risks associated with the java class
file specification.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>Once again Australian
Virus Writers breakthrough with another major advance in the world of Virus
Exchange. Just as Bizatch started the Win32 expansion of the industry,
Strange Brew is hopefully destined to start the ball rolling on Java Platform
infection process.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>Landing Camel International
started research on this project in June 1998 and due to time constraints
from University examinations and associated successive celebrations, as
well as the Australian Ski Season, it was only completed in early August
1998. Whilst I have the opportunity I would like to say a big hello to
all Australian virus writers both past and present and a big thankyou to
my family for invaluable support through the years, further greetings are
extended in the references.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>As an introduction to
the material to be presented in this document, I would like to give some
background on java with some extracts from the java virtual machine specification.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>'Java is a general-purpose
concurrent object-oriented programming language. Its syntax is similar
to C and C++, but it omits many of the features that make C and C++ complex,
confusing, and unsafe. Java was initially developed to address the problems
of building software for networked consumer devices. It was designed to
support multiple host architectures and to allow secure delivery of software
components. To meet these requirements, compiled Java code had to survive
transport across networks, operate on any client, and assure the client
that it was safe to run.'</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>'The Java Virtual Machine
is the cornerstone of Sun's Java programming language. It is the component
of the Java technology responsible for Java's cross-platform delivery,
the small size of its compiled code, and Java's ability to protect users
from malicious programs.'</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>As the extract above
indicates, java is a simplified version of C/C++. Superficially, the main
two differences are that there are no pointers, and routines/functions
are called methods. The difference with most relevance to this document
is the way in which sources are compiled into java binary class files.
These are platform independent files that are made up of java byte-code
instructions, requiring a special machine, known as the java virtual machine,
to interpret these files for execution to take place.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>From the extracts above
it should be apparent that the fellows at Sun are quite pleased with their
creation. It has been this author's motivation to prove incorrect the statement
that the java virtual machine is able 'to protect users from malicious
programs', proving that the 'cornerstone' of java and thus also the language
itself are both fatally flawed. Another motivation also being to open the
world of java platform infection to the virus community.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>This document seeks to
expand the minds of any programmer interested in the java virtual machine
or virus writing in higher level languages. Unlike other platforms where
assembly language is the basis for any program and thus the language of
choice for virus writing, Sun has not specified a java assembly language
format and thus programming for the virtual machine in any language other
than java is rather difficult. For those who are interested there have
been two implementations of a java assembly language, links to which have
been supplied in the references section. I have avoided the use of java
assembly language programming in this text in an aim to keep the bulk of
the information as simple as possible.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>Java has been around
for some years now without any real challenge to security aspects of its
design. A small group of people has attempted to bring to Sun's attention
the flaws in their specification yet there has been no action on these
queries. A person who has taken great interest in the subject is Mark La
Due whose Hostile Applets Site was invaluable to this author in getting
started on the issue of java platform infection. (This site also contains
information on cracking java programs as well as other topics - I definitely
recommend visiting.)</FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the benefits of
the java binary class file is in its ability to be truly platform independent,
thus java viruses can infect all of the following operating systems: linux,
unix, windows NT, windows 9x, windows 3x, etc. However, the great disadvantage
of the java platform is that infection is restricted to applications only
or applets that are also applications. Java platform infection is unable
to occur in class files that are being executed in a browser's or any other
security restricted virtual machine. This is caused by the inability to
access file handling methods,etc. from within these limited machines. It
is still possible to infect applets however Security exceptions will undoubtedly
be thrown by the virtual machine during execution.</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT>
