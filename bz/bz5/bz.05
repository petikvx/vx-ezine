     Enter-View with DiA
  -------------------------

Why DiA ?

Can't really remember why "DiA". It means somethin like D.... i... A..
but i forgot it ;) But i started to write Viruses with this handle, so
I hold it.

Where do you live ? How`s the viral situation in your land ?

I live in Germany in a 75.000 ppl city. The law situation is that
you can write Viruses, but not spread them. But I don't spread Viruses,
so the law don't really interresting me. And VX situation in Germany...
there are a handfull good coders here. But i already notice that there
are more wannabies, but I think it's the same in other countrys.

What are your hobbies (except coding) ?

BMX! The 20 inch bikes, my life. It stands in the front of all. Without
my bike I am nothin =) Other hobby's are trinkin Beer, have a good time
with mates, smoke sometimes, going to Hardcore concerts and do Pogo, 
and of course, sex ;)

What languages do you use and which one is your favorite ?

Win32Asm:
my favourite language, becauze i learned it first (or second ;) after
16bit Asm)

VisualBasic:
I learned it to win a bet, and use it for now for visual programs and
if I want to test somethin, but don't want to write too many lines in 
ASM

HTML:
Use it only for some webpages

JavaScript:
For webpage scripts and I used it for 5-6 Script/HTML Viruses

And less known languages:
VBS, Delphi, Batch, PHP, C/C++

Is theire someone who knows about your viral activity ?

Good mates know that I write Viruses and some "evil" programs. My
parent's know that I code, but not what...

Do you have viral friends ? Enemies ?

Friends of course, I know many kewl guy's to talk about VX stuff, 
womens, beer and so on. Just go to #vxers ;)
Enemies, no. I am a peaceful guy, and if someone told me that he hate
me I don't answer. Enemies can't help you, but friends.

This one is for my zine: How do you consider batch ?

Batch is a old language, with new clothes that guys like you give them.
Simple Batch, I think, it's lame, and easy to code. But if you do new
things it's great! I think it's the same with other languages. If
someone say "It's not a good language!" and you show him/her a new 
awsome code, they will shut up.

What's your favorite AV and why ?

F-Prot. But the DOS version. Becauze it's simple, and good. I never used
AV Monitors. I just want to see if my Viruses are detected.

Do you like payloads ?

Of course, a good Virus had a payload. But I never do destuctive payloads.
Only funny effect's, like slow down the cursor.

What are your favorite zines ?

29A, Xine, ikX, rRlf

Any girlfriend[s] ?

Yep, I have a girlfriend, and I have many fun with her, if you know
what I mean ;P She doesn't know that I write Viruses. And I think it's
better...

Tell us something funny `bout yourself.

Argh, hard question... When I am stoned, and I want to piss, there are
two way's:
1. Piss ~20min without a brake
2. Can't piss
Hehe, I think to much information for you, or not ;)
I am a funny guy at all, and for every stupid action ready!

Do you think there`s life beyound this planet, too ?

Why not?! A harder question is: Do you think if other life exists, write
they Viruses =)

What`s the best thing that happened after joining the viral scene ?

Better coding skills, many ppl to aks somethin, and a lot of fun.

Do you think virii making is dying ?

Nop, never ever, it only changes in any way. Look at the scene in 1995
(many coders, many Viruses) and now in 2004 (not much coders, many worms).

If you would ever be accused & caught 4 something, after that, would you
create any new virii ?

Yes, i will code a new one, but without releaseing, only for me and my mind
:)

How do you see the life without virii ?

Not a big difference, but in some points it would be shitty!

Any future plans ?

Not that big to offer it here, i just live my life, in german i always
say: "Der Beste Plan ist keinen zu haben!" ->means: "The best plan is to
had no plan!"
