     Enter-View with Retro [rRLF]
  ----------------------------------

Tell us more about your nick.
I had a software company which went by the name as Retrospect. After retrospect finished, i
decided to use the name Retro for everything i did (games, IRC, etc), as i liked it at the time
and its stuck ever since.

Where`s your home and how many coders are there ?
I live in good old england. I dont really know many coders from here, i think only about one or
two, but from what i know they have left the scene.
I'm sure there are lots of people from england who it but just keep too themselves.

Any other hobbies ?
I really dont have the time for any other hobbies apart from coding, as i work too hard.

In what languages do you code ?
I work with VB, C++, Pascal, slowly learn ASM and .NET. 
My favourite language though is c++ you just cant beat it.

Does your family/friends/girlfriend[s] knows about this activity ?
No, none of my family, i was going to tell my girlfriend once, but i dont think she'd know what
i was talking about so i didn't bother in the end. The only person who may know would be my Head
of IT at college when i was there, but haven't seen her in a while, thank god.

Do you have any vx friend/enemy ?
I have many friends in the VX scene, which i try to stay in contact with, but that the moment
its hard as i've been so busy this, that and the other. The only person i dont like is Johnlw,
but i wouldn't call him an enemy. If you have seen the newest ezine by 29a then your know why.

How do you see life without virii ?
With the technology we have we'll always have viral, whether we like it or not. I find it very
hard to believe that one day, it'll all fizz out.

Do you think there`s life beyound this planet, too ?
Yes, some where there is, and some day we'll know, maybe not in this life time or the next, but
when we find out we'll probably just nuke em too pieces anyway.

What's your favorite AV and why ?
Hmm i dont really have a favorite AV, but i do use Norton on my system. I wouldn't wanna use
any of these free AV software, i personal wouldn't trust them at all, but i do get on with
norton and it does the job its gotta do.

What zines do you read ? Any favorite one ?
Theres only two i read now really, all the others have disappeared which i'll sadly miss. I read
29a and rrlf, but 29a's ezine has started to bore me now, it always seems to me to be the same
stuff. I love rrlf though such a mixture of contents never a dull moment :) always look forward
to it.

How do you consider batch ? What about this zine ?
I've never used batch for viral, but i dont see any problem with it. If thats what people wanna
coding in then fair play, let them. I dont like it when people start slagging off others for
using some other language except ASM or C++.

You`ve recently joined rRLF. How do you feel ?
Its nice to be with people who care about what they love to do, and not randomly pumping out the
same technique. I dont like working on my own and prefer working in a group, and helping others
alike.

Any future plans/projects ?
At the moment i'm currently looking into mobile viruses for symbian 60 devices. I'm sure one day
its going to happen!
Also finding better ways of spreading for epoc devices. I developed a virii for epoc which
spreads through infrared, but it has a low spreading rate, as you need someone else near by to
conect too.
