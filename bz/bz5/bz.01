  A few begining words

  Hy Batch Zone readers (& everybody else) ! Sorry for delay (hey SpTh); it was a hard period for
 me. I`ve disapointed everybody near me and they disapointed me. Another thing: it seems that
 I`m not welcomed on #vir and #virus coze I`m a romanian and coze of promoting batch so much.
  Those days I`ve seened a real lamer on www.astalavista.com. He uploaded a win32 virus. When
 decompresing the zip I was surprised to see a text. I open the text with a viewer and i`m
 very surprised coze at begining it was a virus generated by BoM of SAD1c, then some parts from
 my BVCK and some stupid lines from him. Where the ideea of win32 ? He sawed in our disclaimers
 that this virii can easily spread on the internet. His name is something like Macca or Mecca.
 But you can check it by yourself. No credits from "author", of course.
  Everyday I receive 10 copies of Netsky worm via mail, 5 spam mails and every week almost 10
 mails from newbies that want to learn Visual Basic and c++ via mail; and they expect from me
 to teach them. Well, with this HUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE Internet you can find hyndreds of papers with
 everything you need guyz. I`m a busy man, too. I also have school, friends, girlfriend, family
 and rRLF ... and the time isn`t enough for all of them.
