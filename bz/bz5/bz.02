Why SlageHammer ?
My nick comes from my personal hobby to hunt, shoot or in general love guns.

Where do you live ?
Somewhere in Europe.

How`s the viral situation in your land ?
More than 1.

When have you started collecting stuff ?
During the first half of of 1995.

What are your hobbies (except collecting) ?
Girls, guns, dogs, hunting, fishing, collecting stamps, coins, and get as far as
I can from the city to get inside the nature.

Do you have viral friends ?
Prolly my best friend is stil my Colt in 10mm but I also think to have some
friends like Ivan, Alexander Druskinov and others.

Enemies ?
My ex wife before of all, couple of girls after her, and ... I really have no
idea. 

This one is for my zine: How do you consider batch ?
Well, I think every original code must be respected and appreciated, at least
this is my point. I don't code so for me its hard to understand a PE as well a
batch so the real point is avoid code ripping, when this point is over, every
new code deserve attention. Batch, who loves them, with the actual OSes have some
more troubles than in past since its more hard get them working with the actual
environments.

What's your favorite AV and why ?
My Brain, every AV is good or bad but is a sample is new, and done to spread,
not just for probe coding skill, most like will be undetect by every AV so
the best AV is still my brain.

What are your favorite zines ?
I don't have time to read zines and surf on the web but I must say every zine has
something interesting, useful, depends from the intention of the zine.

Any girlfriend[s] ?
1 Ex wife, 2 dogs, 1 FG in .Hu, 3/4 in Italy, and some other are "in process".

Tell us something funny `bout yourself.
I`m sorry. I don't see anything funny on myself.

Do you think there`s life beyound this planet, too ?
Yes, it will stupid to think we are the unique in universe.

Do you think virii making is dying ?
Virii are like tits: some years ago they were all original maybe not big, now
much are around, big ones, but most are "fake", I mean nothing original, full
of silicon, most don't even work, just crap.

How big is your collection and how big will be ?
My collection actually is "more than 1" and will be "more than 1".

How do you see the life without virii ?
Of course, hobby is hobby, I don't live for collecting viruses, it is just
something that help me in spend better and faster my working time since i can
do it while i work.

Any future plans ?
Yes, win a lottery, move to Russia, and open there a Model Company.
