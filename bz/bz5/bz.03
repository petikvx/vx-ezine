I just try to code anythings by my hand, I've writen viruses in VB, VBS, Pascal, delphi, Js,
php, asp, cobol, batch, C++, C# (the most dificult and my first project called "C#++" but at
the momment, it never released coz I don't have much time to finish it). But the most I like
is VBS.coz when I wrote batch or php or asp or js, VBS always help me. :)

virus I ripped spth's BWG, and I ever put ibbm in my page (in 2003), kefi very angry with me,

Enemies ? I don't care.

This one is for my zine: How do you consider batch ?
WOW ? " I think Batch is not too hard, just try to make something work in batch". actually in
the first I really didn't like batch, but when I saw spth's article about encryption method in
batch, that is greatz, it gave me spirit to write some batch.

What's your favorite AV and why ?
KAV, coz they almost visit my page weekly.and giving right name of my virii.

coding is encryption.
