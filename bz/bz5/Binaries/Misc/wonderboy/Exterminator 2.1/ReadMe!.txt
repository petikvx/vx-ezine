IMPORTANT - READ THIS FIRST!
****************************

This Version of Exterminator is much better than the first but to completely clear your
history you must press the "Clear History" button on the box that comes up at the end. 
This should completely delete all the known (known by me anyway) history files.

About *
*******

The Exterminator program was created to delete unnecessary and/or unwanted files kept by
Microsoft, but the first version didn't delete all of them. This version deletes more of
them but there is still one problem. The History folder in Internet Explorer still shows
some of the files. This is why you need to press the "Clear History" button on the box 
that comes up at the end. It is also recommended that you set the "Days to keep" in the
same box to 1 but not necessary. This version has no known bugs like the first one but
it hasn't been fully tested and it does not work on XP. My XP version should be coming
soon. E-mail me with any bugs, questions etc.

Note*

In this version (V2.1) of Exterminator I have left the source code readable so that you
are able to see where all those nasty files are kept and also to allow you to add to it
if necessary. But don't alter the file unless you know what you are doing. Also, if you
get an error message saying: "Sharing violation reading drive C" theb just press F and 
if you can fix the problem. To do this edit the file and everytime it says cls replace 
it with pause and delete the "@echo off" from the beginning, then when you run it see 
where it says "Sharing Violation..." then delete the line that caused it, from the 
batch file. Don't forget to change all the pause back to cls!
