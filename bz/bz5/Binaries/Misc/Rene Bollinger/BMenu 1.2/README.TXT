
B M E N U  -  a batch-file enhancement  Version 1.2
---------------------------------------------------

Use this program with keystoke or mouse to choose your applications from
only one batch-file.
To do so create an ascii-file for menu-contents and write your batch. An
example for each one is included.
BMENU.EXE should be in search-path.
This program is free of charge! Don't modify but distribute!

Have fun!
