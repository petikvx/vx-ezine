t-virus helps u to create smal .bat virus.
A bat virus shoudlnt be really caled a virus it's just a .bat file
that can be opened whith notebook or other writing programs.
What it does do is execute the comands writen on that file.
And thatz what thiz program do it helps u to creat the comands
and also the file that will be saved to:
