BATSH220.ZIP is a replacement for previous BATSHxxx.ZIP
It includes program and sample-files.

BATSH.EXE (v2.20) 
-----------------
To run Windows commands from a file.
Line by Line.
Like BATCH (.BAT) files in DOS,
but with some windows specific commands,
and not all the DOS features.
For WINDOWS 3.1 & WINDOWS 95 (FreeWare)

Installation
------------
Place the files BATSH.EXE and BATSH.HLP together anywhere on the disk.
Write with NOTEPAD a text file with one command per line.
Save the text file with the extension .BSH

Windows 3.1:
Associate with File-Manager the program BATSH.EXE. [File - Associate...]. 
Include the program path in the association.
To install your command-file in Program-Manager, you can drag the file
with the mouse from File-Manager to a Program-Manager group.For this
procedure, both File- and Program-Manager must be visible on the screen. 
You can change the icon shown in Program-Manager with the menu
[File - Properties...]

Windows95:
Click with the right mouse button on the new file and choose [Open With]
from the menu. Select BATSH as program to use. If the BATSH program is
not shown in the selection, you must search it with the [Other..] option.
Activate the box [Always use this program...]

Run your new command-file with a double click on the file-name.


Release Notes
-------------
Version 2.20:
The ICON command can change WINDOWS95 taskbar icons.
A network connection-name (NETADD command) may contain spaces.
The hidden icon label in command-mode (/C) is uppercase. 
Support for Windows95 is added in the help-file.

Version 2.14:
Bug-fix:
The program is now running stable under WINDOWS95.
This is not a 95 update, since some commands (ICON,WAITDROP,PRINTER...)
can not be used yet.
New:
INI Variables	The filename-part can be written with an extension,
so any text file with the structure of a windows initialisation file
can now be used. 

Version 2.12:
Bug-fix:
Under some conditions, the PRINT command kept waiting
much longer than it took to print the file.

Version 2.11:
Bug-fix:
A disabled Help option ($HELP) got active after using the MENU command.
The error-message for an invalid $HELP variable definition was incorrect.
CLOSE (not QUIT) a BATSH instance with an open message-box, did produce 
a system error.
Each SHOW command did rearrange the desktop icons.
The $NET variable was not reset for all NETADD and NETPORT/REMOTE 
conditions.
In some networks, the IF REMOTE command did not search all drives and 
ports, due to non standard return codes.
New:
$TIME/$DATE   The system TIME & DATE is read or set using these variables.
SHOW          New parameters allow to move and size a window, or define 
              the location of a BATSH message-box. 


Since BATSH 2.0, the ASK and CHOICE command are integrated into the
MESSAGE command. BATSH files from previous versions are not compatible
with version 2 files, when using one of the two commands.
