         BatMenu is a menu generation program for DOS batch files.

    As you'll soon see, BatMenu allows you the flexibility to generate
            attractive, scrollable menus for your batch files.

        Please refer to the documentation file for full details on
     program operation.  Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

*intro 2

       I'd like to take just a couple of minutes to demonstrate
           some of the things that you can do with BatMenu.

What's going on here is really quite simple for you to do with BatMenu.
When you're ready, load this batch file into your favorite text editor
and take a look at it.  You'll see that each of the command lines for
   BatMenu contain several parameters which are fully covered in the
                         documentation file.

What you won't see is all this text.  That's because BatMenu provides
a simple method of creating numerous different menus (or as you see
  here, windows) from a single file.  The file is named BATMEN.TXT
          and may be placed just about anywhere you like.

                     Press RETURN to continue...
*intro 3

Well, you say, where's the menus!
        Coming right up!

Actually, what you've been reading
are BatMenu menus.  Try the Up/Dwn
arrow keys and you'll see what I 
mean.

But you want to see menus, right?

OK, but indulge me one more time.

 Press ESC for scrolling text...
*intro 4

   A word on scrollable text and windows
   컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

I just wanted to take a moment to illustrate
that you can scroll through text in a window.

If you lay on the Up or Dwn arrow key for a
moment you'll see that there is more here
than meets the eye, in this window at least.

You see, scrollable menus are very 
similar to scrollable windows.  To have a
scrollable window, you just use BatMenu as
you would with a menu, except you display
text in the window.

I wonder...  Not a bad way to provide help
screens or allow someone to read text in a
batch file.  I've seen a lot o people go to
great lengths to emulate paging through 
text in a batch file with pause commands in
in all the right places.  I think that
BatMenu does that and more in a much more
easy to use fashion.

Now for those menus I've been promising.

         Just press RETURN...

*menu1
Choice 1 -- Well, here's your first menu.
Choice 2 -- You'll notice that only the
Choice 3 -- first 8 characters are
Choice 4 -- highlighted. You can use the
Choice 5 -- [-l n] parameter to limit the
Choice 6 -- number of highlighted chars
Choice 7 -- to 'n'. This allows you the
Choice 8 -- remaining menu space for     
Choice 9 -- explanatory text.
*menu2
Choice 1 -- Of course you don't have to   
Choice 2 -- get fancy if you don't want
Choice 3 -- to.  A simple menu follows.
Choice 4 -- Did I mention that you can
Choice 5 -- have up to nine choices in a
Choice 6 -- menu? You can have fewer, of 
Choice 7 -- course.
*menu3
Choice 1
Choice 2
Choice 3
Choice 4
Choice 5
Choice 6
Choice 7
Choice 8
Choice 9
*menu4

Have you noticed that when you exit a menu that the underlaying screen
is still intact? Nice, right? Of course you can choose to clear the 
screen either before or after executing BatMenu. The easiest method is
with DOS's 'cls' in your batch file, but BatMenu will also do this for
you with the [-c] switch, and this may be quicker.
                        More? Press Return...

Want to quit? Highlight this line with the arrow keys and press Return.
*menu5

                    I hope you find BatMenu useful.

    I believe that you will find it quite flexible and easy to use.

Take a few minutes to read the documentation file. All the details you
need to use BatMenu are there. The format of the BATMEN.TXT file is very
simple, just the text you want in your menu and a keyword to mark each
menu or screen.  Also, please pay particular attention to the command
line switches for BatMenu. They're the key to its flexibility.
