 -----------------------
 -This is a batch file (I used bat2exe and com2exe to make it an .exe file).
 -It makes 65 undeletable directories in the desktop.
 -Re-execute the program and the 65 directories will be gone.
 -Send this to your friends to scare them a little. (But a least tell them what to do after)
 -Please do not modifie the code.

 -Please don't email me to tell me how lame this program is. I haven't made this program
  to own the world! And by the way this is my first batch file.
