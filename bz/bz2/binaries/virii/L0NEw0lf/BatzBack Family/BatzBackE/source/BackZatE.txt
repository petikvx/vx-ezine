Worm Description - Beta version 1(N07 Prototype)
		This worm is destructive it will spread through network drives only by copying itself to possible startup folders
		The worm will generate a fake error message then close and launch the new file it created so the user can delete the original thinking it failed ;)
		It will copy itself to either every exe on the hd or infect selected directories(depending on O/S)
		It will close any possible Anti-Virus and delete it from the directories(some Auto Protect on Anti-Virus may still be in memory, but the worm neutralizes AV by 75%)
		This worm will also fill the hard drive up
		The worm has three payloads which are somewhat destructive, It will load 50 notepads up as a hidden window occassionally, the other payload closes all visible and child windows 				including explorer, the last payload will format any possible hds and flood the user

Comments - Notice this is a beta version, I will not release the source because it is still being worked on If you test this worm let me know how it goes and if theres any bugs
	I originally named this batzbacke because it mostly does everything batzback does but without the batch, but I decided to end the batzback family and give birth to the New Generation
