BatzBack:

This worm uses the power of C++ and batch. It uses Kazaa and mIrc to spread
It copies itself to windows and system directory as BatzBack.scr and starts itself up with windows.
It spreads itself to any possible network drives that can be accessed.
This worm has on infection process, overwritting, :( It has two methods of doing this...
It checks the O/S if the computer has windows 95 98 or ME then picks out some directories to infect.
If the computer does not seem to have 95 98 ME it then checks if NT 2000 or XP.
Since NT 2000 and XP are kind of the same i assumed they had the sam Ms-Dos commands :-\
I know on XP the " For /R \ %%i In (*.exe) Do Echo %%i " will search the entire HD and every single directory for the extension "*.exe"
Unfortunately that option is not available on windows 95 98 and ME :( so thats why the worm has to check the O/S.
The batch file is written and stored in the windows directory.
I made the batch VERY hard to read
I used no program to make it that way :)
I have included BatzBack.Scr(The Worm) in this zip
I also put in the original batch file.
Its not exactly the batch file in my worm but its an example of how it looked. 
The batch file is a jpg bmp and gif infector.
