This is the virus that won philet0ast3r`s contest 1 month ago.
I`ve liked it a lot and i`ve thought that some pplz don`t
have it, and what the fuck, this is a good virus and it
deserves to be seen by everybody.
I didn`t have time to ask Toro if he agrees to show his
virus in my mag and that`s why i`m apologizing.

If u will use anything from his virus, pls give credits
to the author [don`t be a lamer].

Also, i`ve added the main html from rrlf.de when the countest
was still available.
