This program only generates Silly BAT-viruses.But it uses many Encryption techniques.

The first technique is the set-encryption, which uses special characters to encrypt every sign.
The second technique is the fake-real-goto-fake-lable technique.
Next special thing is the pseudo-trash between the whole code. Next function is, that one to
four lines are trash-lines. I'm sure that this program will be a big hardcore-problem for AVs. :D
