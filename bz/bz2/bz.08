DvL: Hy! Tell us something about you (hobby, music, how old r u ...)

Adious: I'm adious and I'm 15 yrs old. I've got some hobbies but my favorite
        is always virus writing. I like different types of music, but it
        depends on my mood of that day itself.

DvL: When did u entered the vx-scene and what was your first virus ?

Adious: I "entered the scene" in 4/8/02 when I joined the rRlf. My first virus 
        is a batch virus  called bat.KrAzY_BoI.

DvL: What languages do you use and which one is your favorite ?

Adious: I know batch, some VBS, some ASM and QBasic. My favorite is still batch
        but this will change as I'm going to learn DOS & Win32 asm.

DvL: Do you have a girlfriend/relation-ship ?

Adious: No.I'm a sucker at relationships.:(

DvL: Your family/friends know about your vx activity ?

Adious: No. My whole family knows that I'm interested in "programming" but they 
        don't know that I'm writing viruses all this while. A friend of mine 
        knows whatever I do with the computers including coding batch virii.
        I'm a little bit famous in school for being known as a "hacker", but they
        just don't know the truth anyways. :)

DvL: Why do you create virii ? Is it for fame, or is it a hobby, a job u like to
     do ?

Adious: It's a hobby, a type of activity that I like to kill my time with. I never
        considered doing it for fame (coz fame sucks, the ppl you make "friends"
        with may turn against you and all that kinda shit). I would like to work
        with a computer company programming for them and writing virii is the cool
        way to learn a particular computer language.

DvL: Who are your best vx friends ? How about the enemies ?

Adious: I don't really have a "best vx buddy" as I'm always out of contact with 
        the VX scene. I hope I'll never make enermies with the other vx ppl. It
        just sucks and it pulls away time to do the really important stuff, like
        writing viruses for example.

DvL: If u will ever get married, will u quit the scene ?

Adious: I'll never get married, as far as I can see. But my social status may 
        change with time. As for quiting the "scene", I never really thought
        about it but the current computer laws may make me quit.

DvL: What are you future plans in the vx-scene ? A new language to learn
     maybe ?

Adious: Yes. I'm going to learn DOS & win32 asm. It's a cool language becose of 
        possibilities that asm could give me but I'm not going to give up on 
        batch coze batch is is the language that I've started with and batch is
        the language that i'm determined to end my VXing days with ...

DvL: Have you ever been hacked or infected ?

Adious: I've never been "hacked" coze my computer is a Pentium 1 computer not 
        connected to the internet. Infected, yes ... my computer has been
        infected by one of my own batch viruses. I've been using the school
        computers for some time and some of the computers are infected by
        Win32.Funlove.B and Win32.Klez.H.

DvL: Do you consider BATch as lame ? Why ?

Adious: No. It's not the language that is lame, it's the ppl who are lame. They 
        don't know how to give out some good scripts; the language is simple 
        but the application isn't. Batch has soooo many posibilities that one
        could imagine, like encryption for example ...

DvL: Who can be called a lamer ?

Adious: A person who rips codes and say it was his "own" code and don't 
        acknowledge the original authors of that perticular virus. A person 
        who loves to make fun of the newbie for writing in a "lame language"
        and keeps attacking that person. And a person who think he is 
        "t00 3133t" to code anything and to speek with a "lamer". Personally,
        different ppl have different opinion about a lamer. I usually respect
        all virus writers around unless they give me a reason not to.

DvL: Do you think virii making is dying ?

Adious: No. The only time when virii making will die is when there is no 
        AVers. We need the AVers to give us target programs to fight against.

DvL: Do you think that too many scripts and too many lamers suround the vx scene ?

Adious: No..what is the diffrence between script viruses and program viruses 
        anyway? They are both viruses. There is always the normal balance of 
        cool ppl like jackie, knowdeth and anti state tortise and the normal
        bunch of lamers who would die away if given some good bannings from
        VX IRC channels and a good flamming.

DvL: Are virii a method of revenge ?

Adious: No..I've never use it for revenge and if u'll need to make some 
        revenge to ppls computers, just splash water on the running computer
        and you would just have the desired effect ...

DvL: Do you like dangerous virii payloads ?

Adious: Sometimes. They are good to convey a massage. But they are none the
        less lame in my opinion.

DvL: What is your favorite zine or mag ?

Adious: rRlf zine :), 29a, codebreakers, IKX, VLAD, 40-Hex and many more, and 
        obviously BZ #1 ...

DvL: If u would be caught, after that, will u create any new virii ?

Adious: No. Knowing how the system works make you aware when they'll be busting 
        you. I just hope that just "computer virus and electronic life fom 
        research" is not illegal like "computer security testing" and "reverse 
        engineering".

DvL: What's your favorite AV and why ? Which do you think is lame, why ?

Adious: I've got no AV in my computer, but my favorite is Trend but obviously
        the best is AVP. Norton is lame as they always can't catch my viruses
        which sucks.

DvL: How do you see the life without virii, a perfect world maybe ?

Adious: No. It's a boring world for me and it would not make learning 
        programming fun any more.

DvL: Greetz and 10x, last words [ i'm not killing you :) ]

Adious: Greets flyes to some vx ppl:
