Part I by NGL + How would the world be without viruses ? +
````````````` ` `````````````````````````````````````` ` `

 Some people think that viruses are bad for the society (lamers). But I think
 that the choice of good leeds to evil and the choice of evil leeds to good.
 Without the evil you can not have the good. These two are undivided, but still
 they are opused, like the sky and the earth. But one without the other you can
 not have. The evil is the consequince of good and we must accept this consequince.
 How would the world be without virii ?
 Well, first of all the AV companys would not exist and a whole industry would crash,
 just imagine how many things are connected, one way or the other with viruses.
 Second of all, the entire BATch language would be dead, because only you guys keep
 it alive. Many of the virus writers that started with it now forgot about it and moved
 on to something "cooler". You must admit ! Third of all, it would be very, very, very
 boring without any danger and spice in the virtual world. I can't imagine a world like
 that, and if we would live it, I wouldn't like at all. Life would suck! But you just
 keep writing viruses and nothing like that would happen. Pliz!


Part II by DvL + Make love not war ! +

   Intro ``Welcome back, crew !``
   ==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==


 I`m scared and I have "cool" nightmarez with my eyez closed. I hate life and I
 love death. Until when and why, maybe who ... those questionz slowly kill me.

 The BZ #1 was on his very beginings only an ideea, an project. When i`ve sawed
 that ppl started to help me, this ideea went higher, on my limits [LOL]. If
 no materials were sended, BZ wouldn`t even exist right now.
 BZ was released with help from the rest of batch coders gang, and b-coze of that
 BZ #1 was a succes. Many 10x guyz ... Hope that the next numbers wouldn`t be as
 low in stuff as this one. If u have any batch or batch related stuff, don`t esitate
 to send it any time to dvl2003ro@yahoo.co.uk
 
 + Should this angry kill me ?
 ` `````````````````````` `` `

 Last week i was very angry from the reasons:

 a) very low batch stuff was send to me for BZ #2
 b) philet0ast3r told me that i can`t enter the rRLF group
 c) RAV ripped KAV`z updates to put them on theire own sites

 + Why do we create virii ?
 ` `````````````````````` `

 This is maybe a questions for both sides, good and `bad`. They [the AV`z] consider
 us a living danger.
 Those who only research theire posibilities and intelectual capacities shoudn`t
 be accused [the rest MUST, LOL].
 I never heard only one damn AV person who sad that we help theire jobz, coze of our
 many lost hours, maybe yearz for many of us, they have something to eat on theire
 tables.
 This is ridiculouz, don`t you see ?

 How can you explain that our work means damage. Let me say it another time, this
 time loud and clear:

cut here [maybe u will need the next lines in your future worm, so due the creditz] 

                   =-=-=-=-=-=[Damage.Work]=-=-=-=-=-=
                            SET DAMAGE = WORK
                            SET WORK = DAMAGE
                   =-=-=-=-=-=[Damage.Work]=-=-=-=-=-=

                    paste it into your new file...
                                                             ( )
My `mouth` has spoken. ``Justice must come to us``  `;p   + [DvL] +

   
 + Problemz:
 ` `````````
  
 B-coze some of you tryed to reach me [some of you even tryed to infect me],
 you must hear my explanation.
 I have serious problems [not that kind of problems, lol]. I`ve failed to a big
 exam, i have fights with my family ... now i must to stay home and to learn for
 that exam which will be on 10~16.08.2003.
 My computer is a IBM pentium 233 mmx, 64 ram, 2 hard disks [210 mb and 112 mg],
 win95 with Plus!, IE 4.01 updated to 5.0, not conected to Internet, KAV 3.5 and
 F-Prot 3.12 [dos version] installed.
 If i wanna update my page or to check my mail i can`t, coze i have money problemz
 and even i the money i can`t get out of house [i`m grounded].
 Sometimes my brother helps me by checking my mail for me.
 Also, i wanna thank you for trying to infect my mail, maybe u allready did it. 
 Those are my ``fans`` [LOL].
 B-coze of low resources and other "tiny" problems to BZ#2, the BZ#3 will be released
 later [in september, i think], when it will have enough stuff, but until then you have
 enough time to send me anything.

  If u think this mag represents what i`ve just told you, get the fuck out from my property.

    these limited commands to accomplish whatever task you might dream up ! - Eric Phelps
