What "junks" is Junk Remover "removing" ?
======================================= 

bad = registry files that the system marks as bad
bak = duplicate (backup) files
chk = ScanDisk disk error files
dmp = memory dump files
fts = temporary files recreated by Windows as needed
gid = help files search data
old = copy of older version
prv = log files created by past windows boot-ups
syd = temporary backup files
tmp = temporary files
*.$*= temporary files
*.~*= temporary files
~*.*= temporary files
*.??~=temporary files
mscreate.dir = creates folders during installations

These are files that are listed in EasyCleaner as unnecessary (which duplicate some of 
the files already listed):
These files are mainly backups, temporary and other unuseable files: *.tmp, ~*.*, *.~*,
*.?~?, *.aps, *.bak, *.bk?, *.bsc, *.dmp, *.ilk, *.pch, *.rws, *.sbr, backup*.wbk, *.$$$,
*.ncb, *.~mp, *.old, *.da0, *.chk. Easy Cleaner can also search for these files: *.fts, 
*.gid, *.mtx, *.nch, *.ftg, *.$db, *.db$. *. NCH are created when you read newsgroups with 
Microsoft Outlook. *.MTX files are created when a scanner-device is used. *.GID files are 
created when you execute *.HLP files. Usage of these files is currently quite unknown, but 
these files are still save to delete. You get mainly temporary free disk space when you 
delete these, because programs (or scanners) create these again when executed.
