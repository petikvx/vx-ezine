   "Viruses don't harm, ignorance do!" ~ Intro ~ Part I, by NGL

   BATch is a way of life; it defines you as a person and builds your caracter. This is what
 this magazine is about. It wants to show the world that BATch rules ! Putting an idea in
 aplication, was only a step that required a lot of courage from DvL. Now the step was
 made, the only thing that was missing was the stuff that will be put in the magazine. Mails
 were send and answers were waited. Some guys agreed to put their materials in this zine and
 things starded to move, the magazine aproched its final form.
   In this magazine, DvL is trying to say that the BATch virii writers do exists and he wanted
 to do something about that. He writed the BATch Zone mag.
   "Viruses don't harm, ignorance do!" - a very true motto that should define the atitude of the
 world as to "BATch people". This "world" is a shalter for persons, and they are right when they
 aren't taking life very serious by escapeing in a virtual world that gives them protection and
 safety. Unlike the real world this one is a lot better, "upgraded".
   People that "live" in this world are "special", they don't care about the rest of the world
 they don't know anything besides their own rules, it's like a small secret society, an elitist
 club. They are just having fun in their own way and most of the time they are misunderstood by
 the rest of the people. They are brave enough to be onest to the rest of the world, to behave
 as they are, they are not hideing by the sinister rules of the society. The metting place is
 the net, the mail adresses and the sites that are well known amongst them. All their free time
 is spendt writing virii or programs or on the net searching for new things that will help them
 in their work. All this guys are extremely crazy (in the good way) and they realy don't care
 about the rest of the world.
	Don't change!


   "The past is past, the future's now ..." ~ Intro ~ Part II, by DvL

  %Intro% - Lamerz 
   I've read intro's from many zines just to see what are theire first words. I will not say like
 everyone else "welcome to the first number from ...". I began to hate those wordz, realy. Try to
 write something else ;]  [this is lame, writing this i'm not accusing anyone]
   This mag/zine was writen for batch coderz or for special newbies (this special newbies will
 use batch language as their first language learned).
   BZ it's a mag which contains BATch nonviral/viral materials for all of us, from beginner to
 advance.
   Also, this mag is for batch researchers, like me and many more; it was writen for batch
 coderz who want to know more, not the same lame scripts (sorry lamerz).
   Becoze we're surounded by lamers, i'm sure that many things from this mag will upset some
 "real" coders, like they seen themselves, (there are some coderz who say that batch it's not
 even a real language; i say it is and i will suport batch writing) or some parts from it will
 be copy-pasted into a lame virus, or ripped.
   
  %Story of BZ MAG%
   One day i was sitting with my friend, MJ, at a table, eating. Near us, one noisy lady
 was talking with another one, noiser than the other one. I don't how i've realised it, but when
 i've taked a bigger look on this store, i've seen the real world. The world, our world, can be
 clasified in just one word : LAME. Everybody likes to dress like that guy from that movie, or
 like that singer, everybody is doing theire jobs on some sort of rules. Yo dudes, this is only
 bullshit. When we do something strange, everybody lookes very strange at us, or they just call
 us nuts or stupid. Very nice from u !~!
   I'm surounded by lamers, everything they do is lame, even theire own life ;)
   I've allways wanted to create a BATch only zine, to show what can we code in BATch language,
 i wanted to learn more from guyz like those i've interviewed, i've allways wanted to show to
 some sellfish guyz that batch virii are virii, too. I could learn asm too, but i don't think
 this is my language that fits me, like philet0ast3r allready sayed to me in his interview.
   The first number is released and i couldn't done it without many cool guyz. Many 10x 4 your
 existence. Keep it like this !~! B UnLame !~!

  %OpinionZ%
   I'm sure that some of you guyz will say:

        /- another lame shit
        \- he he ... the lamers are now happy
        /- bullshit was it's name ???
        \- mag for kiddies
        /- food for lamers
        \- u know the rest ...

   If u think this mag represents what i've just told you, get the fuck out from my property.
