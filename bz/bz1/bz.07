DvL: Hy! Tell us something about you(hobby, music, how old r u ...).

SAD1c: I like playing basketball, listening to music (Heavy Metal-like), 
       riding my motorbike, reading horror books...

DvL: When did u entered the vx-scene and what was your first virus ?

SAD1c: I've officially entered the virus scene at the beginning of this 
       year, but i'm coding for three years. My first virus was probably
       a simple batch.

DvL: What languages do you use and which one is your favorite ?

SAD1c: I can code well in C++ & Visual Basic, but also quite well in C & 
       Java. I like C++ because it's powerful & Scripts because are very 
       simple.

DvL: Do you have a girlfriend/relation-ship ?

SAD1c: At this moment, no.

DvL: Your family/friends know about your vx activity ?

SAD1c: Yes. My sister like it!

DvL: Why do you create virii ? Is it for fame, or is it a hobby, a job u 
     like to do ?

SAD1c: I code virii as a hobby and I like it very much.

DvL: Who are your best vx friends ? How about the enemies ?

SAD1c: I don't have a lot of contacts 'til now, 'cause i've jouned the 
       virii scene recently, but i have contacts with SPTH, Worf & some
       indonesian people.

DvL: If u will ever get married, will u quit the scene ?

SAD1c: I dont know. But I will not get married soon!!!

DvL: What are you future plans in the vx-scene ? A new language to learn 
     maybe ?

SAD1c: Maybe. I'll like to find someone with a good knowledge, to share our 
       ideas.

DvL: Have you ever been hacked or infected ?

SAD1c: Hacked: no. But infected, yes: a corrupted version of CIH, founded 
       into a program given by a friend.

DvL: Do you consider BATch as lame ? Why ?

SAD1c: No, batch isn't lame, 'coze i've started with it and i'll continue 
       like it: it's easy, everyone can understand it, and has a lot of 
       possibilities. I support batch!

DvL: Who can be called a lamer ?

SAD1c: People who spread viruses, people who uses troyans and other 
       malicious programs to make damage, people who ripps virii or 
       programs written by someone else and also who criticize other 
       people's work but can't code nothing good.

DvL: Do you think virii making is dying ?

SAD1c: No, I don't think so!

DvL: Do you think that too many scripts and too many lamers suround the 
     vx scene ?

SAD1c: Scripts are ok, but lamers who spreads it aren't good! Yes I 
       think that lamers are a lot!

DvL: Are virii a method of revenge ?

SAD1c: No! Virii could be everything: hobby, art, a message, but not 
       revenge! So lame!

DvL: Do you like dangerous virii payloads ?

SAD1c: Viruses with dangerous payloads can be written, ok! But spreading,
       as I already say is lame.

DvL: What is your favorite zine or mag ?

SAD1c: I like Petik e-zine, but also [rRlf] e-zine!

DvL: If u would be caught, after that, will u create any new virii ?

SAD1c: Caught? Why? I hope that this won't happen, anyway in this case i 
       think I'll stop writing virii.

DvL: What's your favorite AV and why ? Which do you think is lame, why ?

SAD1c: My favourite it's Kav, because it detect almost every virus, has a 
       very good heuristic system and also a good team for the virii 
       detection. A lame AV? Norton, because it cost too much and it 
       hasn't a good detection system.

DvL: How do you see the life without virii, a perfect world maybe ?

SAD1c: Life without virii? Empty and boring!! I hope this will never 
       happen!!!
