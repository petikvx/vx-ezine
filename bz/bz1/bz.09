DvL: Hy! Tell us something about you(hobby, music, how old r u ...).

philet0ast3r: Hi! I'm a 20 years old (at the moment, that is 27.5.2003)
              dreadhead from Germany, Bavaria (that's where the best 
              beer comes from :). Most of my hobbies can be combined to
              four letters: rRlf. Which is being webmaster and 
              zine-editor for rRlf.de, coding more or less silly batch 
              stuff and producing mind-altering computer graphics.
              Besides that I read a lot, get political active and listen
              to a broad spectrum of music, that is mostly new-metal, 
              punk, hardcore and other loud things. All the time that 
              is left I try to spend with other ppl. And I got lot's of
              time, cause I'm a proud unemployed :]

DvL: When did u entered the vx-scene and what was your first virus ?

philet0ast3r: Around February 2001 I wrote BlackDay phinal, which I would 
              call my first real virus (nevertheless a quite lame one). I 
              was interested in viruses before and already wrote two bad
              asm virii, and also rRlf already existed to this date. I 
              submitted BlackDay phinal to Pinoy Virus Writers E-Zine #6,
              and through this came in touch with some vx-scene ppl. Soon
              after I became member of SallyOne Group, which had a very 
              short life. We wanted to release a zine, but it didn't get 
              that far. The stuff I wrote for it had too much worth for 
              me, so we decided to put it together to a rRlf zine. At the
              latest to the release of rRlf#1 we are a part of the 
              vx-scene.

DvL: What languages do you use and which one is your favorite ?

philet0ast3r: I think I can say, that I can code quite well in batch. I 
              also know vbs, a bit js, and a bit win32asm (and html if
              that counts). But my absolutly favourite is batch, because
              it's like art. A definition of art: Creating fine things
              despite of restrictions.

DvL: Do you have a girlfriend/relation-ship ?

philet0ast3r: Sure :) I told her, that I'm going to write an interview 
              today, and she said, I should mention her somewhere, so:
              Hey babe, I love you :)

DvL: Your family/friends know about your vx activity ?

philet0ast3r: If ppl spend much time with me, they are getting it 
              automatically, because I spend much time with vx related
              stuff. Some find it interesting, some boring, some
              terrible, but they can't change it anyway.

DvL: Why do you create virii ? Is it for fame, or is it a hobby, a 
     job u like to do ?

philet0ast3r: Creating virii is a hobby for me. I like spending my
              time with it. Not only the coding, but all the things
              that suround it. Even if it changed me a lot: Hobby is
              all it means to me. If it bores me someday (I don't 
              hope/think so), I'd stop.

DvL: Who are your best vx friends ? How about the enemies ?

philet0ast3r: My best vx friends are the ones in my group :) The cool
              thing is: You get to know lots of cool ppl with this
              kind of hobby (check the greets at the bottom). But of
              course you don't only meet cool ppl. There are lots out
              there, that would like me and/or the rRlf to disappear.
              A big FUCK YOU to all of these. I don't give a shit on
              your opinion.

DvL: If u will ever get married, will u quit the scene ?

philet0ast3r: No. Why should I? I hate children, and am not planning
              to get some. And I already spend lots of time with my 
              girlfriend (hehe, she has the same opinion on kids).
              Nevertheless I have enough time for vx things.

DvL: What are you future plans in the vx-scene ? A new language to 
     learn maybe ?

philet0ast3r: I wanted to learn win32asm, but stopped some time 
              ago...It's not the right language for me. But I got 
              some more never-done-before-with-batch-things in 
              mind :)

DvL: Have you ever been hacked or infected ?

philet0ast3r: Hacked, no, not really. Infected, sure: I'm regularly 
              infecting myself with my own creations to test them :)
              ... I also let the favourite of my viruses (which is 
              not released) run around free on my PC. I'm improving
              it from time to time. It's funny seeing it develop and
              making notice of itself when I've nearly forgotten it
              again. Before my vx days I just once got infected by
              Parity.Boot.B (I think).

DvL: Do you consider BATch as lame ? Why ?

philet0ast3r: I can't, cause I love it :) It seems mostly asm coders
              think batch is lame, I would say this is just one thing:
              Arrogant. Yes, win32asm can be more difficult, but a
              language itself can not be lame. Of course there are lame
              batch viruses. As there are lame viruses in any other
              languages. Btw: I know lots of lame asm virii ... Argh,
              I'm getting sick of this topic...

DvL: Who can be called a lamer ?

philet0ast3r: Those who call their program, that just contains 
              copy-and-pasted code, their own creation. And those that
              consider themselves more worth than you, because their
              hobby is in a language more complicated ... It's a
              decision: If I really wanted to write viruses in an other
              language, I would learn it. I would also say, someone is
              a lamer if he wrote more or less good code some years ago,
              and now is doing nothing besides being elite, hanging
              around on irc, and going "newer" vxers on their nerves.
              The best example for my last two lamer-definitions is (he
              seems to be the most disgusting lameass on this planet):
              daniel aka CyberWarrior aka The Bughunter

DvL: Do you think virii making is dying ?

philet0ast3r: I think yes, but this is a very slow process. As techniques
              get more difficult every time, things are also getting more
              difficult for newbies to learn. If you want to make
              something really new, you need a high knowledge.
              But also new operating systems and file formats are
              developed all the time, with lots of new stuff to exploit
              (of course these also get more complicated every time).
              Another thing that could be a danger for the virus writing
              scene is global politics. With more and more rights of the
              normal human being cut off, because of savety, anti-terror,
              or whatever you call it. It's just one thing: Control. It's
              not hard to imagine that writing viruses could be made
              illegal.

DvL: Do you think that too many scripts and too many lamers suround the vx 
     scene ?

philet0ast3r: No, I don't think so. I think it's normal. Every scene is
              surounded by lamers and wannabes. It's also logic there are
              more script viruses than viruses in "real" languages ...
              script-languages are easier. But: Script or not, computer
              virus is computer virus.

DvL: Are virii a method of revenge ?

philet0ast3r: Sure they are. But I think most of the viruses produced by
              the vx scene are not written for this reason, but to show
              off programming techniques. It's clear that also ppl that
              can't code are using viruses. For revenge for example.
              That's why you can see disclaimers everywhere :)

DvL: Do you like dangerous virii payloads ?

philet0ast3r: Sometimes :) Many ppl say, that destructive payloads are
              bad for the virus, cause it's goal is spreading. So there
              is no sense in destroying it's spreading platform. And
              it's also morally wrong. Well, I got one counter-argument
              for both: I don't spread my viruses. So if it's not made
              for spreading, just for showing it to others, there is no
              sense in careing for the spreading platform, right?
              And as I don't spread viruses, I'm not responsible for
              damages caused by others.
              The only thing that's true and bad with destructive
              payloads is: The only viruses that are known to "normal"
              ppl are viruses that destroyed a lot. Cause bad news sell
              better than good news. Normal ppl think viruses have to
              be bad and virus authors are criminals, but you can't do
              anything against it.

DvL: What is your favorite zine or mag ?

philet0ast3r: rRlf zine of course :) I got no real favourite ... I read
              all vx related zines I get in my hands.

DvL: If u would be caught, after that, will u create any new virii ?

philet0ast3r: I think yes, but I would make damn sure they stay on my pc.

DvL: What's your favorite AV and why ? Which do you think is lame, why ?

philet0ast3r: My favourite av is AntiVir Personal Edition. It's a little
              german av, but good an free (www.free-av.de). I just got
              this one, and don't know many others. Usually I send my
              creations to Trend, because I think they write good
              av-reports. And I love to quote Ratter: "My favourite AV
              is my brain. I don't use any other :)"

DvL: How do you see the life without virii, a perfect world maybe ?

philet0ast3r: Not perfect but boring :) I don't want to imagine a world
              without virii, cause I love them.

DvL: Greetz and 10x, last words[ i'm not killing you :) ] ...

philet0ast3r: Some greets and thanks in (maybe not ;) random order:

              LiSt and all rRlf members.
              Also thank you for interviewing me (and not killing
              me :).
              My works can be seen on www.rRlf.de, next to other
              weird things :]
              Be sure to get an answer: philet0ast3r@rRlf.de
              ... Friend of mine just came in, and we thought about
              cool last words. The decision fell on: "What have you
              done with my goddamn shoes?!" (the first one, who can
              tell me, where this comes from, wins a @rRlf.de 
              e-mail-address :)
