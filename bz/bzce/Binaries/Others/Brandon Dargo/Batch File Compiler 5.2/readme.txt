  *Tips when writing batch files

  @ECHO OFF - Put this command at the beginning of your batch files so the commands
              do not show while the batch file is running.

  CLS       - This command will clear the screen, useful for closing the window after
              the batch file is finished.

  PAUSE     - Stops execution of the batch file until a user presses a key, useful
              for stopping a window from closing before seeing any text on the screen.
