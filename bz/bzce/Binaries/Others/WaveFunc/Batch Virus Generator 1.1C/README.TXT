Wavefunc's Goofy Batch Virus Generator
======================================
Release # 1.1C        October 25, 1995

This batch program generates a multitude of replicating
virus-like batch programs from user-specified parameters.
Read the notes and disclaimers before using.

Reasonably stock MSDOS 6 is required!
Enter BVGEN to start the program.

BVGEN exists because it is possible for it to. I just happened
to be the one that would rather code in batch than C, I take no
credit for the code. It is obvious, I just wanted to spend a bit
of time in another universe and this is the result. And now that
it exists I hope THIS code works properly now!

Greetings to batch fans worldwide!

If any of the EXE or COMs are different then something's very wrong!
If the batch is different then it has been edited in some way,
hopefully for the better.
