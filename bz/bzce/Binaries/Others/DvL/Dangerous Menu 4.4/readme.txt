 USE this utility at YOUR OWN RISK !!!
 I'm NOT responsable for any damage caused to your or any other computer.
 Dangerous Menu has been extensively tested with Win95/IE 5 and it works fine on 
my IBM PC/233 mhz, 64 MB memory, 200 MB hard drive, I can't say how well it will
work on your system.
 After downloading or starting the program u r responsable for your actions.
 Use the program only if u have a clean windows instalation, and use it with no 
applications opened. (FOR YOUR OWN GOOD), u must have the last wsh update (it works
with older versions, too)
 This program was only designed for win9x, and not for winxp or any other windoze.
 This program only teaches u something about scripts andits power ... DON`T use
it for spreading or anything else, learn something from it ;)
 I`ve spend many hours learning batch, vbscript and the rest, don`t rip DM, try to
understand the scripts, try to see what they do, but only on a safe computer, use
Deep Freeze to freeze your files and to safely try the virii.

If u want to report a bug or you want to ask me anything mail me.
