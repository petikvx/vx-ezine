Batch Infection With Assembler by Black Jack

We all know: everything that can be executed is also a potential target for virii. This is of course also true for the simple script language included in MS-DOS known as batch. So what are we waiting for, let's infect it!

I hope you already know that a BAT file is nothing else than DOS commands stored in a text file that are executed one after one. Therefore infection is incredibly simple, just add your code at the beginning and/or at the end of the host code. There's nothing more to do, it's even simpler than COM file infection. The only problem is that the BAT language is very limited in its abilities, remember, they just consist of DOS commands! Nevertheless it is possible to code virii in 100% batch script if you use some coding tricks

(look at Knowdeth's virii, for example, or at the tutorials by Wavefunc). But I will go a different way in this tutorial: I write my batch virii in assembler (like all my virii). But this brings up another problem: how can a text script carry binary code? The main topic of this tutorial is to provide workarounds for that problem and present examples.

1. USING DEBUG SCRIPTS
----------------------
Everybody who has MS-DOS installed in one way or the other (even WinNT users) has also a copy of the neat old debug.exe . And it is an well-known trick that it is possible to use it to create binary files out of debug scripts. Well, I think it is quite clear how we can use this to create a BAT infector: the virus ECHOes out a debug script into a temporary file, creates a binary (usually a COM file) using debug and runs it. And so the ASM part takes control and finishes the life-cycle of the virus by either direct infection or going resident.

My Battus virus demonstrates this technique. It is a TSR BAT infector that generates a com file with debug. Then it extracts its code from the bat file with the standart BAT virus find command and attaches it to the COM file. This COM contains a small program that stays resident and monitores the file open functions of int 21h. If it detects that a BAT file is opened (that could mean executed, copied, typed...) it opens the file and appends its own batch code (if the file wasn't infected before, of course). Battus is also slightly polymorph by changing the case of the letters of the batch code.

As a payload, it displays the message: "Battus is now stoned." on March the 20th (the birthday of the ancient roman poet Ovid). Battus is a charakter from Ovid's "Metamorphoses" that was transformed to stone because he tried to fool the god Mercur. That's why this message has two meanings, because it can also be interpreted as a parody on the stoned virus. What can I say, I thought it was funny. ;-)

2. ANOTHER WAY USING DEBUG
--------------------------
was discovered by Blacksmith Tony. What he's doing is writing the whole bat code in a way that it can run as both a BAT file and a debug script. He used this technique in his Roshi (published in TI#1) and Mappy (published in CB#5) viruses. I don't feel like explaining exactly what he does here again, if you are interested in this technique, just read his sources, they also contain a
very detailed description on how this virii work.

3. WRITING COM/BAT HYBRID CODE
------------------------------
The trick here is that you write your code in such a clever way that it can be executed as both a BAT and a COM file. Let's look at the BAT code of my Combat virus as an example (assembler code is a little bit below):

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:Àé³
@Echo Off
Set Combat=%0
If %Combat%/==/ Set Combat=C:\Autoexec.bat
If Not Exist %Combat% set Combat=%0.bat

Copy %Combat% Combat.com > NUL
Combat.com Jack
Goto End_Combat

[here is the binary code of the virus]

Combat virus by Black Jack /LineZer0 /Metaphase
written in Austria in November/December 1999
:End_Combat
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first line starts with a doublepoint. That's why it is interpreted as a label by MS-DOS and just ignored if the file is executed as a BAT file. Then the main bat code is executed. What it does is copy itself to the file COMBAT.COM and execute itself again, but this time as a COM file, that is, binary code. And now the first line is treated completely different, as machiene code instruction! And the binary code ":Àé³ " means cmp al, al / JMP binary_code. You see, if the file runs as a BAT, the binary code is simply ignored, and the other way round.

And here is the promised full assembler source code: Combat is a memory resident COM/BAT prepender (with host shifting). When an infected file is run, no matter if it is a COM or a BAT file the virus will get control. It then creates a temporary file (COMBAT.COM) with pure virus code and executes it. This instance of the virus stays resident then as a standart DOS TSR program, interrupt 21h will be hooked. If any .COM or .BAT files are executed or opened the virus will infect them by shifting the host back and writing

the virus code to the beginning of the file.

4. ENCRYPTING THE BINARY CODE
-----------------------------
Why is it actually impossible to carry binary code directly in a batch file? Because batch files are text files, and not all characters that can be found in binary code are also legit in text files. For example, everybody knows the characters 0Dh and 0Ah that are carriage return and line feed, used to mark the end of one line in a text file. Also the batch language itself uses some characters for itself (the pipe symbols < > |). Another possible workaround for this problem is to encrypt the binary code of the virus in such a way that it doesn't contain this characters any more. And this was done in the

following SkauroBATes virus. It uses a simple encryption algorithm that shrinks the number of possible characters in the code to 32 which are all possible, but it doubles the size of the code. And also the decryptor has been written in such a careful way that it doesn't contain any illegal characters. And this encrypted code is simply ECHOed out in a temporary COM file by the BAT instance of the virus. Concretely this code is appended to infected BAT files:

Del Skauro.com
REM SkauroBATes virus by Black Jack /LineZer0 /Metaphase
REM coded in Austria in December 1999
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's just a little problem with this method: the second line is of course very long. And many DOS versions (for example MS-DOS 6.22) can't handle lines of that length, that means the virus won't work with them :-( Anyway, I have tested it under Win95b/MS-DOS 7.10 and it works ok there.

About the virus, there's nothing more to say. After the first infected BAT file (or the first generation COM) is run, it goes resident and appends itself to all opened BAT files.
