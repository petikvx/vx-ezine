Interview with Lawrencium by DvL [rRLF]
---------------------------------------
Date: 11-November-2003


>Why Lawrencium ?
<Lawrencium is a radioactive metal. I chose that as my handle because
 it's a cool and somehow evil sounding word :)

>Where do you live and how is the situation of the virus scene in your land ?
<I prefer not to say where i live. I don't think there's a virus scene in my
 country.

>What r your hobbies (except coding) ?
<I'm a composer of electronic music. Those are my only hobbies,
 that and coding.

>When did u entered the vx-scene and what was your first virus ?
<I'm quite new to the virus scene, in fact i don't think i'm really
 part of the virus scene. My first 'virus' was a lame EXE-prepender
 written in Visual Basic.


>What languages do you use and which one is your favorite ?
<My favourite language is C, but i think the only choice for viruses
 is assembly. (Batch viruses of course are a wholly different chapter)
 I'm quite good at assembly under MS-DOS but have yet to learn win32asm.
 I can also program in various BASICs.

>Do you have a girlfriend/relation-ship ?
<No. I never had.

>Is theire someone who knows about your vx activity ?
<I sent Wronger (which is published in Batch Zone 3) to a friend,
 but i didn't tell him that i'm learning to write viruses in assembly.
 So no, pretty much no one knows about my virus activities.

>Why do you create virii ? Is it for fame, or is it a hobby, a job u like to do ?
<It's a hobby. Learning to write viruses is learning a black art, there's something
 sinister about it. Something cool :)

>Who are your best vx friends ? How about the enemies ?
<I don't know anyone in the virus scene.

>If u will ever get married, will u ever quit the scene ?
<I will never get married, trust me.


>What are you future plans in the vx-scene ? A new language to learn maybe ?
<Well, i'm still making my way through DOS assembly viruses to PE infectors.
 My latest achievement was a non-resident COM-appender. So, you see, there's
 much to learn.

>Have you ever been hacked or infected ?
<I was infected by a subspecies of the Lamer virus, which was quite
 wide-spread in the old days of the Amiga scene. It's a virus that
 would overwrite your boot-blocks with "LAMER!", so all disks that
 used custom boot code were fucked. I didn't like that.

>Do you consider BATch as lame ? Why ?
<What's so cool about batch viruses is the unorthodox use of a
 scripting language to create something that was thought impossible.
 I've seen routines for decimal arithmetics and linked lists being
 written in Batch (in "DOS Batch language - A personal view" by
 Ted Davis), it's crazy.

>Who can be called a lamer ?
<The kind of person that likes to boast his web-design and Visual
 Basic abilities in the presence of his computer-illiterate friends.

>Do you think virii making is dying ?
<No. Wherever technology is going, there will always be the kind
 of program that does things it shouldn't be doing, that reproduces
 itself without the knowledge of the user, well, there will always
 be viruses.


>Do you think that too many scripts and too many lamers suround the vx scene ?
<I don't know the virus scene.

>Are virii a method of revenge ? Do you like them ?
<Revenge is for women.

>What is your favorite zine or mag ?
<The Coderz mag is pretty cool. I hope there will be new issues
 coming out.

>If u would be caught, after that, will u create any new virii ?
<Yes. I would write viruses in jail if i had access to a computer.
 No one can stop me now, 'cause i don't care anymore. :)

>What's your favorite AV and why ? Which do you think is lame, why ?
<My favourite AV is KAV. But then, it's pretty much the only one
 i've tried :)

>How do you see the life without virii, a perfect world maybe ?
<There would be one cool underground scene less.

>Where can we see your works and how can we contact you ?
<Not at all.
