Introduction to batch
=====================
Batch is one of the easiest scripting languages out there it is based on MS-DOS what a lot of
people don't know is that MS-DOS is not a mere program or just something on your computer but
it is actually and O.S. or operating system. This operating system is actually more powerful
than the MS-DOS that you are use to on your windows Operating system. When you run MS-DOS under
windows like most people do because its either being run under Windows or is run just as DOS it
loses some of its potential since it has to interact with windows as well. In the old days they
didn't have GUI or Graphical User Interface. So all that they had to use was DOS. DOS stands for
Disk Operating System.

How to start a batch file
=========================
To make a batch file all that you have to do is simply make a new notepad. Yes that's right all
that you need to make a notepad, you don't need all that fancy software. Once you start a new
batch file you put in the code and go to "File" then to "Save As". Once you are in the "Save As"
windows go and name it whatever you want but instead of just having the name like normal at the
end of the name without a space type ".bat" (without the quotes of course).
For example: FirstBatch.bat
Now you know how to make a batch file now all you need is to learn the code !

The Basics
==========
When you make a new batch file you need to declare if you want the code to show (when ran the
code will be shown to the user running it) and this is not recommended most times for it
distacts the user from the main point of the program and makes them wonder what all those weird
words mean. Most often people who use batch on a regular basis turn off the echo so that it
wont tell the user the code as well. How you do this is by simply writing on the first line:

@echo off

Now some of the basic commands are echo, copy, del, deltree.

Echo - displays text written after the "echo" for example:
Echo "Hello, I hope you enjoy this tutorial"

Copy - this will copy the batch file to the given directory, for example:
Copy  C:\Program Files\new folder

Del - deletes certain file, for example
Del  C:\Program Files\new folder

Deltree - deletes a tree of files in given directory, for example:
Deltree C:\Program Files\new folder

Start - starts a .exe (program) for example:
Start notepad  (or if not a built in program) start C:\ProgramFiles\new game.exe

Now lets take a look at this when its all put together.

@echo off
Echo "Hello, I hope you enjoy this tutorial"
Copy  C:\Program Files\new folder
Del  C:\Program Files\new folder
Deltree C:\Program Files\new folder1
Start notepad

Loops
=====
Loops make something happen over and over again and never stop untilspecified to or forced to
(like shuting down your computer). To make a loop do this:

:loop
(code)
Goto loop

In a more real situation it would look like this:

@echo off
:loop
Echo Hello, this is called a loop! And I will keep saying this
Goto loop

note: you do not have to make the name "loop" in the code you can have it anything for example:

@echo off
:cheese
Echo you see!
Goto cheese

More advanced stuff
===================
How to create a blank line in a batch file
==========================================
What you do is write Echo only at the end of echo put a period for example:
Echo.

Disable mouse or keyboard or both
=================================
c:\windows\rundll.exe mouse,disable
c:\windows\rundll.exe keyboard,disable

How to make a choice for the user
=================================
@ECHO OFF
REM - LABEL INDICATING THE BEGINNING OF THE DOCUMENT.
:BEGIN
CLS
REM - THE BELOW LINE GIVES THE USER 3 CHOICES (DEFINED AFTER /C:)
CHOICE /N /C:123 PICK A NUMBER (1, 2, or 3)%1
REM - THE NEXT THREE LINES ARE DIRECTING USER DEPENDING UPON INPUT
IF ERRORLEVEL ==3 GOTO THREE
IF ERRORLEVEL ==2 GOTO TWO
IF ERRORLEVEL ==1 GOTO ONE
GOTO END
:THREE
ECHO YOU HAVE PRESSED THREE
GOTO END
:TWO
ECHO YOU HAVE PRESSED TWO
GOTO END
:ONE
ECHO YOU HAVE PRESSED ONE
:END
CLS

How to start a program maximized
================================
START /M "C:\WINDOWS\NOTEPAD.EXE"

CREATING A BATCH FILE DELAY
===========================
How to delay a batch file any where from 5 to 99 seconds. In the below example we show a 5
second delay.

TYPE NUL | CHOICE.COM /N /CY /TY,5 >NUL

HOW TO MAKE A TIME LOG
======================
In the following example you will have the capability of creating a time log of when the batch
file is loaded or for example in the autoexec.bat when someone logs into a computer.

ECHO. |TIME > TIME
COPY LOG +TIME

A  diferent and more complicated method that to my knowledge cannot be used in Windows NT,
Windows 2000 or Windows ME would be the following:

echo @prompt set date=$d$_set time=$t$h$h$h > {a}.bat
%comspec% /e:2048 /c {a}.bat > {b}.bat
for %%v in ({b}.bat del) do call %%v {?}.bat
echo %date% %time% >> log

For the above batch file to work properly you must create a file called log by typing "edit
log" (without the quotes) and then save an exit the file which will create the file at 0 bytes.
If this file is not created or not created properly you will receive the error message "Content
of destination lost before copy".

How to quickly replace the file extensions of several files
===========================================================
xcopy *.vbs *.wav 

How to restart the computer from a batch file
=============================================
START C:\WINDOWS\RUNDLL.EXE user.exe,exitwindowsexec

Or:

rundll32.exe shell32.dll,SHExitWindowsEx n

Where n is equal to one of the following numbers for the proper action.

0 - LOGOFF
1 - SHUTDOWN
2 - REBOOT
4 - FORCE
8 - POWEROFF

How to run a batch file each time the computer boots
====================================================
Place a line in your autoexec.bat that calls the batch file each time you want to boot the
computer. For example:

CALL C:\myfile.bat

Shutdown for windows 98 and ME
==============================
RUNDLL32 SHELL32.DLL,SHExitWindowsEx 1.

Shutdown for Windows XP
=======================
shutdown -r -t 10

Deleting files in MS-Dos without a prompt
=========================================
To get rid of the prompting use the deltree command and add the tag /y
For example:
deltree c:\windows\temp\*.* /y

Although this does nto work for all versions of MS-DOS and windows if this does not work try:

echo y | del %1\*.*

Once created, you can type the name of the batch file then the name of the directory that you
wish to delete.

Syntax Notes
============
To be functional, each DOS command must be entered in a particular way: this command entry
structure is known as the command's "syntax." The syntax "notation" is a way to reproduce the
command syntax in print.
For example, you can determine the items that are optional, by looking for information that is
printed inside square brackets. The notation [d:], for example, indicates an optional drive
designation. The command syntax, on the other hand, is how YOU enter the command to make it
work.

Command Syntax Elements
1. Command Name
   ============
The DOS command name is the name you enter to start the DOS program (a few of the DOS commands
can be entered using shortcut names). The DOS command name is always entered first. In this
book, the command is usually printed in uppercase letters, but you can enter command names as
either lowercase or uppercase or a mix of both.

2. Space
   =====
Always leave a space after the command name.

3. Drive Designation
   =================
The drive designation (abbreviated in this book as "d:") is an option for many DOS commands.
However, some commands are not related to disk drives and therefore do not require a drive
designation. Whenever you enter a DOS command that deals with disk drives and you are already
working in the drive in question, you do not have to enter the drive designator. For example,
if you are working in drive A (when the DOS prompt A> is showing at the left side of the screen)
and you want to use the DIR command to display a directory listing of that same drive, you do
not have to enter the drive designation. If you do not enter a drive designation, DOS always
assumes you are referring to the drive you are currently working in (sometimes called the
"default" drive).

4. A Colon
   =======
When referring to a drive in a DOS command, you must always follow the drive designator with a
colon (:) (this is how DOS recognizes it as a drive designation).

5. Pathname
   ========
A pathname (path) refers to the path you want DOS to follow in order to act on the DOS command.
As described in Chapter 3, it indicates the path from the current directory or subdirectory to
the files that are to be acted upon.

6. Filename
   ========
A filename is the name of a file stored on disk. As described in Chapter 1, a filename can be
of eight or fewer letters or other legal characters.

7. Filename Extension
   ==================
A filename extension can follow the filename to further identify it. The extension follows a
period and can be of three or fewer characters. A filename extension is not required.

8. Switches
   ========
Characters shown in a command syntax that are represented by a letter or number and preceded by
a forward slash (for example, "/P") are command options (sometimes known as "switches"). Use of
these options activate special operations as part of a DOS command's functions.

9. Brackets
   ========
Items enclosed in square brackets are optional; in other words, the command will work in its
basic form without entering the information contained inside the brackets.

10. Ellipses
    ========
Ellipses (...) indicate that an item in a command syntax can be repeated as many times as
needed.

11. Vertical Bar
    ============
When items are separated by a vertical bar (|), it means that you enter one of the separated
items. For example: ON | OFF means that you can enter either ON or OFF, but not both.
