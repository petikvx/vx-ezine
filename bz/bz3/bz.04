  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=


Hy! Tell us something about you(country, hobby, music, how old r u, age).

>i'm alcopaul, a 18 < x < 30 year old guy who currently loves reading cracking 
>tutorials from the late 90's and listening to bob marley.

When did u entered the vx-scene and what was your first virus ?

>i think i entered the vx scene less than 2 years ago (or 2+ maybe, can't remember)
>and my first malware was the historic batchwerm.

What languages do you use and which one is your favorite ?

>i'm now rusty with regards to programming but i'm learning things again. :D. before, 
>i knew visual basic, batch and some dotnet languages.

Do you have a girlfriend/relation-ship ?

>i once had a girlfriend. now i'm available. :D. if somebody's interested (girl of course), 
>just mail me.. :D

Is theire someone who knows about your vx activity ?

>i think yeah because of the "Perrun" hype.

Why do you create virii ? Is it for fame, or is it a hobby, a job u like to do ?

>before, virus writing was a hobby at the same time a pursuit of fame (or notoriety).
>(let's face it, guys.) now, i guess i'm beginning to lose interest. :(

Who are your best vx friends ? How about the enemies ?

>philie, energy, petik, jackie.
>
>enemies? i love my enemies, if there are any, coz the Bible tells us to do so.
>"love thy enemies."

If u will ever get married, will u ever quit the scene ?

>even though i won't get married, i can (and will) quit the scene anytime.

What are you future plans in the vx-scene ? A new language to learn maybe ?

>i don't know. but now i enjoy reading cracking tutorials by great crackers.
>and knowledge of win32asm helps to understand their texts. yes, i'm learning win32asm.

Have you ever been hacked or infected ?

>before, i didn't mind if my box was infected or hacked. i didn't install any protection then
>coz i believed that "if you love creating malwares that can potentially infect other's
>computer, then let your computer be infected as well" (golden rule!). but good thing is that
>i didn't spread my works. :D


Do you consider BATch as lame ? Why ?

>batch isn't lame. it's an "expensive" language. it is a language that is bundled to your
>operating system. if you wanna learn batch, you must have an operating system, compared to
>assembly programming, you only need tasm/masm. an operating system (windowsxp home/professional)
>costs more than $99 and masm/tasm is downloadable from the internet. :D
>anyways, batch is a great language although its syntax is limited. thanks to windows xp coz
>new routines are added to batch.

Who can be called a lamer ?

>the one who calls someone a lamer is a lamer. we were all lamers at a single point of our vx
>life.

Do you think virii making is dying ?

>it's not dying. maybe virus coders are just busy in their own real lives, have difficulty in
finding loopholes in windows xp, etc. 
>
>virus making won't die i think coz operating systems have commands/routines that viruses
>can use to spread themselves.

Do you think that too many scripts and too many lamers suround the vx scene ?

>yeah. scripts that basically do the same. and too many newbies who some experienced vxers
>call "lamers"."newbies, learn and enjoy your stay!" :D

Are virii a method of revenge ? Do you like them ?

>i don't take revenge on someone i hate coz i believe in karma. 

What is your favorite zine or mag ?

>i'm proud of our zines, the b8 zines. natural selection by feathered serpents is currently on
>a directory of my computer. i've read coderz #3, rrlf #3 and bz (your) zines. 29a's zines by
>far are the greatest zines that i've ever read.

If u would be caught, after that, will u create any new virii?

>absolutely not.. :D . one must learn from his mistakes.

What's your favorite AV and why ? Which do you think is lame, why ?

>avpdos32 because that's the only protection my computer currently has. lame av software?
>there's no such thing, i think. all av softwares are products of great coders and i salute
>them for making such programs.

How do you see the life without virii, a perfect world maybe ?

>anti-virus companies will close and a lot of people will have no jobs..
