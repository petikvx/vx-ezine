 * disables keyboard and swaps the mouse buttons
 * encrypted via the "set" command
 * it will generate from a debug-script a file that
   i`ve created with Acid-Draw x.x version. This dropped
   file looks like an BSOD (blue-screen-of-death). The
   BSOD will appear on every boot, after that the pc will
   reboot (cool looping, hah ?)
