my IBM PC/233 mhz, 64 MB memory, 200 MB hard drive (that's why i've created Junk 
Remover). 
 It also works with IE5 and IE6.
 I can't say how well it will work on your system.
 It's YOUR responsibility to make sure that Junk Remover does what you want, that
Junk Remover and other programs don't conflict, and that it works with your OS.
 Use the program only if u have a clean windows instalation, and use it with no 
applications opened. (FOR YOUR OWN GOOD).
 I assume that you use only Windoze (Win9X), and not a dual os system.
