1.Hy! Tell us something about you(hobby, music, how old r u ...).

 Hi! I'm adious [rRlf],15 yrs old and I'm from Singapore,the only place in the world where chewing gum is 
 banned.Mainly my hobbies includes writing viruses,surfing the net and reading odd text that I downloaded.
 I was at first lost in the hacking scene when I tried to learn how to deface websites.After some stupid
 texts later..I think it's way better to hack into my own computer.Of cause it is not the "scene" for me.
 That was when I found some links to rRlf's website and Pinoy virus group.What attracted me was the way
 that the VX world is so more like a community..we all know who is who and who hate who,etc..
 As for personaly,I almost fit the stereotype of a so called virus writer as I do not realy socialize.
 But I don't really need to tell you the sob story,right? :)
  
2.When did u entered the vx-scene and what was your first virus ?

 I entered the scene since the time I joined Brigada Ocho,but unfortunely the group desolved a day after I
 joined.So alcopual told me to join the rRlf.Since rRlf site is the first virus site that I visited,it was 
 like a dream come true when i joined the group on august 2002.Then I found out that there are better,greater
 and even cooler groups than the rRlf.But i just sticked with my decision anyways.. My first virus is a simple
 odd batch virus named KrAzY_BoI.It was a little lame.I didn't really polished my skills until I found out the 
 true meaning of writing a virus,which is to learn and share ideas and thoughts.

3.What languages do you use and which one is your favorite ?

 I use batch for viruses that I've written.I also know a bit of Qbasic,VBS and some asm.
 My favorite for now is batch because it has still so many possibities even within so much restriction.

4.Do you have a girlfriend/relation-ship ?

 No.I do not even have a "girl friend".It's just strange..ppl judge the way you walk,speak,dress,on how your
 eyebrow looks like and all that other crap.This starts during my early primary school years and comtinues 
 ever since.As I'm still hunted by my past,I'm neither really sociable nor friendly.I do not have much luck 
 at finding a friend.Well..I'm also a little paranoid so when I looked at ppl I always thought that they will
 reject me.What the hell..I'm always unwelcomed everywhere.

5.Your family/friends know about your vx activity ?

 No,and maybe :) My family do not know anything about programming and they just know viruses as "bad 
 program".As I do not really have friends most ppl in my class don't really know of anything that i do but 
 they only know me as a "hacker".

6.Why do you create virii ? Is it for fame, or is it a hobby, a job
  u like to do ?

 Mainly for fun or a hobby.It is there for me to kill my time with.Maybe it's more than just a hobby..
 count the amount of time i sat infront of my computer..some of my teachers were shocked :)

7.How are your best vx friends ? How about the enemies ?

 well..I do not have a "best" vx friends.But if I must have one,I think he would be philet0a$ter.
 He allowed me to be on his group and a nice guy to chat with about the silly laws.enemies:well..
 I could not really care about them..usally those who love to push ppls tolerance of rage over the
 edge.Those who tell me to program win32asm when he himself does not code anything..

8.If u will ever get married, will u quit the scene ?

 I don't know.My opinion may change from time to time.It is soo hard to think about it now.

9.What are you future plans in the vx-scene ? A new language to learn
  maybe ?

 Uhm..I'm not realy free to write some other batches and learn a new language..you know the saying:
 "the future is now".So I tried to think about it and I told myself to stick with batch for a while and then
 move on to win32 and DOS ASM.After that my choice is open.I would like to write a virus in .NET software 
 developement tools and in C,Pascal for linux hacking.

10.Have you ever been hacked or infected ?

 No.. I was naver hacked (don't really know) and I mainly test my virus/worms to my computer..
 well..I'm thinking of setting up a Linux-Windowz LAN for me to test out the latest exploits with and maybe
 set it up into a wargame computer once I'm 17.Till then,I've just got to wait.

11.Do you consider BATch as lame ? Why ?

 No..there are alot of possibilities in batch...there are some ppl who swore that they coded in batch for 
 5+ years and still found it great..well..I'm determined to end my vxing days with a batch virus..
 If I start with batch,I'll end with batch.

12.Who can be called a lamer ?

 This is the type of ppl I consider lame:
 1) a person whose only job is to make you look like a moron and make you try to give up.
 2) a person who thinks he is the "king of the world" (nah,"king of the turd-eating b*****ds") and nags 
    and tells you what you should do..ie."If you wanna be leet prog in ASM!!!"
 3) a person who writes shit about other ppls work but do not writen anything.
 4) a person who rips codes without the original authors permission or do not give credits.
 5) a person who runs a virus without understanding the risk involved in doing such things..

13.Do you think virii making is dying ?

 No..There will alway be some newbie who would go in and try to see cool new stuff and the old guys that will 
 always be helpfull.As long as file sharing,programming and ppl are around,there will always be virus writers.
 Of cause some ppl would always like to believe that it is dying,just like those morons who tells us that the 
 world is comming to an end (the AVers maybe).The amount of new stuff dropped but you can't really say the VX
 scene is dying..look at the guy who chatted on VX IRC channels.If the VX world is dying..I think that there 
 will be nobody to chat to (maybe you could harrass the guys at #newbie :).

14.Do you think that too many scripts and too many lamers suround the vx 
   scene ?

 No...I know that there are some scripts that kewl..some done by jackie and anti state.
 of cause there are lame ones..there are lame stuff everywhere..in every scene and comunities..so it is
 really up to the author and observer to know if the script is lame.Really,lamers like to waste their own and
 other ppls life & time..always remember time is money (that is the case here),so don't waste your time on 
 them.

15.Are virii a method of revenge ?

 No!!who ever did this should be cut into bite-size chunks and be feed to the dogs..

16.Do you like dangerous virii payloads ?

 No..sometimes depending of the mood I'm on.If I'm angry I'll rather make some weired text to be showned.
 I only do this for a hobby..I do not wish to get caught.All dangerous viruses will distroy everything..
 What is the worth of a dumb virus that could not work and distroys files?

17.What is your favorite zine or mag ?

 I read alot of zines by hackers/phreaker/VXer/coderz/cracking groups.But in the VX world I like reading
 29a and iKx (it doesn't mean that I don't really like other zines).They are usally made by some cool
 guys that could help you out in your virus writing.

18.If u would be caught, after that, will u create any new virii ?

 No..we have to abride with the law..I don't want my future to be distroyed.But then again why would they
 want me when I do no damage and writing a virus is just (for me) like many other hobbies that I had?   

19.What's your favorite AV and why ? Which do you think is lame, why ?

 I think that you need a AV to test out ways to work out some AAV tech or retro stuff.I also use the stupid 
 Nortan Anti-Virus in my school.Well..I think that if there is no AVs,they will always
 be no VXers..it's more like a chalange for us to bypass all the AVs. 

20.How do you see the life without virii, a perfect world maybe ?

 No..It would never be a perfect life.I think it should stay because it is a fun way to learn
 some programming languages and at the same time have fun learning with the virus that your writing.My life
 would be boring without it coz I kinda read alot of files on viruses (that don't make sense anyways).Vxing
 is preaty much part of my life..just like school.

- Greetz and 10x, last words[ i'm not killing you :) ] ...

 Ok..to make things short..I would like to greetz to the following ppl (in no perticular order):

 SPTH,VxF,Kefi,alcopaul,Knowdeth (how's the BBS going?),MHA,haxors labs,evil angelica,all the defacers 
 and all of those who knows me IRL.

 To ppl who knew me in real life:
