    After two (pretty) succesful issues, here`z issue 3, better
    than both of them ... (i think) !!!
    
    Believe me or not but i`ve worked a lot for this number.
    I wanna apologize for my "litlle delay", but it was for
    everybody`s interest.
    
    I`ve worked a lot on my projects: Dangerous Menu and Junk
    Remover (does anybody cares for them or i only spend my time
    like a fool, pls tell me). I`m trying to learn more vbscript,
    c++ and vbasic 6.0, but i don`t have the necesary time and
    space on my hdd.


    Some VX news:
    +++++++++++++
    - i`ve lost contacts with SAD1c, my best vx-friend.
    - i`ve contributed on rrlf#4 and asked philet0ast3r if i can
      join rrlf.
    - SpTh will not code batch anymore.
    - http://vx.netlux.org/ is down and as I know SpTh is the only 1
      who has a new host.
    - Dolomite and Industry have been kicked out of the rRlf due to
      inactivity.
    - rRlf #4 is at the point of its releasing, so go to rrlf.de and
      check the page those days.
