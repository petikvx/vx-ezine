 A lot of ppl say that batch sucks, but I think what I like the best at batch is trying to do
more with less.
 There are still many things that are waiting to be discovered in batch, like SpTh told me about
EPO in batch (still don`t know how to do it), or when i`ve first mailed Philet0ast3r and asked
him to give me ideas about some new batch viruses, he told me to make a memory resident one
(well, i`ve maked bat.ram-drive: it stays in memory doesn`t it ? ;D).

 I don`t know how many ppl r reading this zine or for what reason, I don`t know who`s visiting
my site and why, I don`t know my virtual enemies and I don`t even care about your opinions.
 This issue wants to give ya some ideas and some gewd articles, just enjoy them, but like me,
give credits to real author (at least).
 Something else, for those I didn`t emailed: sorry but I didn`t forgot you, but I just
couldn`t ... I also have a personal life, and life without internet @ home sucks.
