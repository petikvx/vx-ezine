     Enter-View with Kefi [rRLF]
  ---------------------------------

Why Kefi ?

Well, I really don't know. I've been asked that many times before, and can't give a "good"
reason. To be completely honest, I don't remember how I got the name "Kefi." Suppose it doesn't
really matter though. After choosing it, I found out that it means "fun" in Greek. And I think
that's neat. XD

Where do you live ? How`s the viral situation in your land ?

I'm from America. Michigan, to be more exact. The virus scene is . . . here, I suppose. Don't
hear much about it other than the media telling me that we're all bad people. XD  There are some
other authors from the States as well, however I have no contact with them at the moment . . .

What are your hobbies (except coding) ?

Wow, this could go on for awhile. I'll make it short though. Some of my more hobbies are:
playing the bass guitar, photography [still-life stuff], studying religion [however I am
currently Agnostic], reading, watching/making movies, skateboarding and just hanging-out with
friends.  I'm quite a busy person since I've got so many hobbies. This makes VX-life rather
dull at times.

What languages do you use and which one is your favorite ?

I use anything I can get my hands on. I've written viruses in: assembler, Basic, Visual Basic,
Perl, Python, PHP, JavaScript, C++, batch, VBS, macros . . . probably more, but I don't remember
right now. I just try to write something for every language I can.

Right now, my favorite language is C++. I've been working in it a lot lately. I've also been
playing with assembler a lot .  C++ is still my favorite though.

Is theire someone who knows about your viral activity ?

Yes; my friends, family, and just anyone that asks. I've got nothing to hide. . . so I don't
hide anything. XD

Do you have viral friends ? Enemies ?

Yeah, of course I've got VX-friends. I've got no enemies though . . .

This one is for my zine: How do you consider batch ?

To be completely honest, I'm bored of it. I used to not like it too much, 'cause it seemed like
very batch-virus would overwrite *.BAT in the current directory, and drop a bunch of .VBS/.REG
files to do its work. But that's just the lame stuff! There's another side to the batch-world.
Where you try to do something new, and inventive . . . for examples, look at nearly any
batch-virus written by philet0ast3r or Second Part To Hell. They're definitely the batch-coders.
Also, I thought the batch-scene would become big again, with BatXP and all. Because you can do 
stuff like edit the Registry without dropping files, etc. I was wrong though. Most "new" batch
stuff is just using lame Outlook-spreading-stuff as well as old-mIRC-scripts.

What's your favorite AV and why ?

I personally don't use AV. It's usually bad software; it uses too much space, eats up RAM, and
is slow as Hell regardless of the speed of your computer.

My favorite would have to be TrendMicro though. Because they do reports on *every* virus.

Do you like payloads ?

Depends on the virus and style of payload. Destructive payloads are stupid and lame. Others can
be good, but not for viruses which want to stay undetected for awhile . . .

What are your favorite zines ?

I read all zines which are written in English or German. The zines which I'll usually open-up
are: 29a, MATRiX, SLAM, rRlf, and iKX.  Oh, and BZ, of course. XD

Any girlfriend[s] ?

Yep. I've got a girlfriend, her name is Amy.

Tell us something funny `bout yourself.

I write viruses for fun.

Do you think there`s life beyound this planet, too ?

Yes.  Don't know what it is though.

What`s the best thing that happened after joining the viral scene ?

Meeting people from other countries.

Do you think virii making is dying ?

I often think yes, but then I change my mind to no. It's an odd topic. I think what is actually
happening is that: people are loosing inspiration and ideas. This is not stopping people from
mass-producing bad viruses though . . . I really hate checking AV-sites to read about new stuff,
and seeing stupid VBx-worms being all that has happened within the last month.

If you would ever be accused & caught 4 something, after that, would you create any new virii ?

Nobody needs to catch me. I'm open about virus-writing. I don't spread viruses. I actually do
the opposite. I tend to send samples of viruses to AVs so they *can't* be spread.

How do you see the life without dangerous codes [virii, constructors ...] ?

I think that computer users would be stupider. Other than that, not too different. I'd need a
new hobby though . . . XD

Any future plans ?

Yes. I'm currently a high school student, and I'm planning to go to college. Nothing other than
that though.

Where can we see your works and how can we contact you ?

I've got some viruses on www.rRlf.de. You can reach me by e-mail, if you'd like. My address is:
kefi@jwdx.com.

Greetz.

"Greetz" to all my mates.
