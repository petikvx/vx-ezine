Why Zed ?

Don't really know... just short and simple really, and I don't know of 
anyone else in the vx scene with the same nick

Where do you live ? How`s the viral situation in your land ?

I live in Australia. I'm not really sure of the situation regarding computer 
viruses and stuff over here, I don't think I have seen an Australian vx 
group...

What are your hobbies (except coding) ?

I'm not really into sports that much, but I do enjoy playing some of them... 
I like Cricket and sometimes Boxing.

What languages do you use and which one is your favorite ?

I prefer to use Visual Basic because you can code programs faster and more 
easily than some other programming languages. I can program in VBScript, 
which is probably my best programming language. I can also code JScript, and 
I'm trying to learn a bit of Visual C++ 6 and batch at the moment.

Is theire someone who knows about your viral activity ?

Most of my friends know that I can code computer viruses... They probably 
don't care because I don't send them out to other people or run them on 
thier computers. I just code computer viruses because you learn more about 
the language, and when their really isn't anything else worth coding.

Do you have viral friends ? Enemies ?

I have one friend who is into malicious coding, but he mostly programs 
"trojan-stlye" programs and basic tools.

This one is for my zine: How do you consider batch ?

I think that batch can be very affective and has some better capabilities 
that other languages (such as VBScript) cannot do like running in MS-DOS, 
but I think that it is mostly limited because other script languages have 
become the majority.

What's your favorite AV and why ?

Probably Norton AntiVirus because more options and is able to withstand some 
trojans which try to turn off the antivirus scanners.

Do you like payloads ?

Not really... I am into making worms more than any other malicious program. 
I like making them "stealthy" so that they can steal passwords, etc. I there 
is a noticable payload, the computer user will realise that there is 
something wrong with their computer and format it or someting. I think that 
worms survive better without a payload.

What are your favorite zines ?

Don't really konw. Probably ones that include a variety of programming 
languages.

Any girlfriend[s] ?

Nah not at the moment.

Tell us something funny `bout yourself.

Don't really have anything that is funny about me that stands out.

Do you think there`s life beyound this planet, too ?

Nah, don't believe in aliens and stuff.

What`s the best thing that happened after joining the viral scene ?

Dunno really. I learned how to code.

Do you think virii making is dying ?

Nah I think it is growing more than anything, as easier programming 
languages like Visual Basic come out, the more virii-writers there will be.

If you would ever be accused & caught 4 something, after that, would you 
create any new virii ?

Nah, I'd probably be to angry or annoyed.

How do you see the life without dangerous codes [virii, constructors ...] ?

Probably the same with computer worms, etc.

Any future plans ?

When I finnish my education I'd like a job in the software-area in the IT 
industry.

Where can we see your works and how can we contact you ?

Just at this email address [Zed@rRlf.de] or http://www.rrlf.de/

Ok, thanks for that interview.

Zed
