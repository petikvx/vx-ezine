Hi all. Just to start, I am not an AVer. AVs suck, they are buggy and are usually prone to 
exploitation. Feel free to fuzz the hell out of lief and capstone. I am sure they have bugs.
Now on to how to disinfect...

The PT_NOTE injection technique is quite clean and allows for a ready made memory slot to be filled
with goodies. But with all infection techniques, there is usually always a disinfection technique.
This is the nature of life.

I like to think of the easy by which to disinfect as a way to measure just how good an infection
technique is. The more constants in a disinfection technique, the more likely it will be broken 
quicker. The game of cat and mouse goes on and on, and is the only way to develop more and more 
insiduous virii. Keep playing the game with yourself and your virus will be the thing of madness 
and wonder. 

In this disinfection we use the fact that most virii will try to load the PT_NOTE segment as far
away as possible in case the binary is large and they are trying to make sure the goodies dont get
mapped over and cause some loading issues with the binary cause you gotta be surreptitious right?

We use Kmeans as a way to start and cluster the PT_LOAD segments together and we use the the inertia
of the clusters relative to their centroids as a way to measure how well Kmeans even did. Usually 
for infections there is 1 PT_NOTE being infected but maybe sblip will tell you later, sometimes 
there are 2 :)

  if (math.log(cluster_1.inertia_)/math.log(cluster_2.inertia_)) < INERTIA_RATIO:

Once we have found out which segments seems to be mapped a bit farther than usual (though if you 
wanted to map the PT_NOTE inbetween valid PT_LOADS and re-base the whole image, I mean who would do
such a thing?), we can begin to delve into its code.

Usually these virii will do some more worming around, infecting more files, but at some point they
need to let the program continue execution, you know, to avoid suspicion. We can assume that the jmp
to the original entry point occurs at the end of the infected PT_NOTE segment so we look for that.

Sometimes the jmp is direct, sometimes it is derived. We just follow the jmp target to a point where
it adds the OEP to the base it calculated before (if you want to get really fancy, you can always 
use a use-def chain, but of course the virii can get even fancier and force you to resolve your 
chain cross function boundaries OH MY!)

  add {target}, CONST

Pop that back into your PHDR and you're back to the action

Better luck next time friend!
