    Brother Mikey contacted me by voice the other day, and asked
    me to document the specifics of how i got took over the moderator-
    ship of the virus echo. He said to make a nice article and not to be
    crude and say things like s*it and f*ck, so of course i shall
    not do anything like that :) The whole thing started about two
    months ago, when Paul Ferguson was claiming moderatorship of the
    Virus Conference echo. it seems that Paul was allowing encrypted
    messages to be transfered through the echo (using the PGP program).
    Now at the time i was a major hub (i am still a fidonet hub, but
    i transfer no where near the amount of mail that i did then) for
    fidonet, with just about all of the Z1 backbone being transfered through
    my system.

    i notified Mr. Ferguson that it was illegal to transfer
    encrypted mail and quoted him the part of BackBone Operating
    policy (BOP 1.03) regarding encrypted mail:


             5.2  Banned Messages
             --------------------

             The Backbone does not distribute any conference which routinely
             contains messages which are encrypted, contain illegal information or
             promote illegal activities.  As used in this paragraph, "illegal
             activities" includes activities which are a violation of civil
             law as well as activities which would result in criminal
             prosecution.

        Now i want to point out that i was very polite to Mr. Ferguson,
    i informed him that  as a sysop could not verify the mail if it
    was encrypted, to see if it did in fact violate state or federal
    laws, and that in any case since i was paying the long distance
    phone bill to bring the echomail in, i did not appreciate mail
    that i could not read. As i said, i pointed this out very politely.
    The next thing i know, i get the extremely nasty message from Mr.
    Edwin Cleton, telling me that he was the moderator, and that
    basically that i should in no uncertain terms shut up. Now at this
    point, i am confused. First Paul Ferguson is claiming moderatorship
    and now Mr. Cleton. So i checked out the Elisting (for those not familiar
    the Elist, is a listing of all fidonet echos and the moderators of
    each echo). After consulting the Elist i found something very
    interesting, neither Mr. Cleton or Mr. Ferguson were the proper
    moderator, someone named Marc Spain was. i pointed this out to Mr.
    Cleton in the echo, that neither him or Mr. Fergson was the proper
    moderator of the echo. At this point, Edwin lied to me. He told
    me that both himself and Mr. Ferguson were in fact Elisted and
    kicked me out of the echo, sending netmail to my sysop asking
    that my feed be cut.

i AM CONViNCED THAT iF SOMEONE DOES NOT DO iT FOR YOU, EVERYONE ON THiS
EARTH MAKES THYSELF THEiR OWN PARTiCULAR HELL ON EARTH

    Now a funny thing happened when Mr. Cleton sent my NC a message. You
    see my NC John Burton is a straight arrow in fido. He is not a bad
    sort, but he lives and breathes fido, goes to sleep with Policy4 and
    BOP 1.03. When he found that Mr. Cleton was not the proper Elisted
    moderator of the echo, well he just ignored him (funny thing is Cleton
    kicked John Burton out of the echo, and he doesn't even get it). 
    Now personally, this whole deal made me a bit upset. i decided i was
    not going to take this lying down. i got on the phone to a friend (who
    though is a REC of fidonet, will have to remain nameless at this
    time) i was able to obtain the Elist password for Virus (but as it
    turns out i did not need it, the Elisting had expired). So i Elisted
    the echo, petitioned for it's return to the backbone which made
    me the moderator. Guess what, my first official act was to throw
    Cleton out of the echo :)

YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT, UNTiL iT'S GONE

    Mr. Cleton was quite upset when I threw him out of the echo, regardless
    of how this whole thing turns out, the following message makes the
    whole thing worth while:

Take no notice of this idiot, he has been access denied to this echo for over 2
months, but some usa nodes either refuse to listen or are being blackmailed to
not cut links, mr. paris has been and very likely still is involved in child
porno where he managed to involve others who are now facing exposure if they
cut links to his node, I am working on it, patients please.

Ec., Moderator VIRUS Conference

     Will i retain moderatorship of the echo? Well that remains to be
     seen, certainly by BOP 1.03 i am the moderator, it states:


4.2  Recognition of Moderators
- ------------------------------

A Moderator is recognized as follows:

    1)  Upon formation of a conference, the person who forms the
        conference is the Moderator.

    2)  Upon resignation or replacement of an existing Moderator,
        the conference's rules define how the new Moderator is
        selected.

    3)  Should a conference which originates inside of FidoNet be
        without a moderator for over 30 days, the ZEC may cause a
        Moderator to be selected.

Moderators are responsible for:

    1)  Seeing that messages in their conference correspond to
        the conference's theme.

    2)  Updating their conference listing in Echolist at least
        every six months.

     As you can see policy is very unclear about moderation of the
     echos. Generally, by tradition the Elisted moderator, is the
     moderator. He has the Zone 2 ZEC on his side but i am not without
     my own supporters. Regardless i am having fun, and even were
     i too lose i feel i have gotten even with Cleton. Those who live
     in glass outhouses shouldn't be so quick to throw shit :)
     So keep watching everyone, for as long as it lasts.
