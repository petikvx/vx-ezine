   -=Welcome to the CRISNEWS section called "KEYRING"=-

Who the heck am I?                      Yoooo Know Me.. Right?

...used to line in Montreal, canada... then I had to move to
virginia... know me yet? I now have a system in .....

I could send you netmail, but would you know if it was me?
I could be your closest freind, or your worst nightmare.

Digital signatures are now the standard for Identification.

Who the heck am I?                      Yoooo Know Me.. Right?
Well lets just say you will have to find that out on your own.
Run this section thru PGP and it will identify me, maybe.

Anyone that wants to respond with particular questions may send their
F.A.Q.'s to CRIS BBS.
This section is NOT written by Michael Paris, and ONLY DIGITALLY SIGNED.

This section of CRISnews is written by a regular fidonet sysop that
just happens to support PGP encryption. I also participate in the
Secure Mail Network of Fidonet. And I know my pgp in my sleap.

Alright lets get to the beef, First part deals with your liabilitys
if you censor your mail. Next part is the solution, read the secure
mail network info packet and join in if you agree. If you do want to
join the secure mail network the person you want to contact is GK Pace
at Fidonet 1:374/26
I see the only way to safeguard my system and myself is:

     1) Create a personal certified PGP key.
     2) Not censor any In transit mail on my system.

And the final third SECTION contains all the need parts to put together
your own macros for a .msg type netmail editor (frontdoor/Intermail)
FOR USING pgp WITH FUNCTION KEYS, a real nice and easy setup.

I will conclude this introduction at this part and let the data speak
for itself.

How do you create a key? What is PGP?

All I will say is that there is already alot of fine sources that explain
all of this in great detail. The PGP23a.zip contains two .doc files that
are not only huge, but are also very clear and easy to understand.

Heres the first page:
                          PGP Version 2.3a - 1 Jul 93
                                  Software by
                               Philip Zimmermann
                                      with
                Branko Lankester, Hal Finney, and Peter Gutmann

     Synopsis:  PGP uses public-key encryption to protect E-mail and data
     files.  Communicate securely with people you've never met, with no
     secure channels needed for prior exchange of keys.  PGP is well
     featured and fast, with sophisticated key management, digital
     signatures, data compression, and good ergonomic design.

I could not have said it any better, maybe "its great!".

Think of PGP as another PKzip, but different.
You have a program, and parameters, and filenames. What happens is affected
by the command line parameters and optional filenames.

==============================[Imported]========================================
ref:PGPDOC1.TXT  Page 33
    ====================
     Here's a quick summary of PGP commands.

     To encrypt a plaintext file with the recipient's public key:
          pgp -e textfile her_userid
      
     To sign a plaintext file with your secret key:
          pgp -s textfile [-u your_userid]
      
     To sign a plaintext file with your secret key, and then encrypt it 
     with the recipient's public key:
          pgp -es textfile her_userid [-u your_userid]
      
     To encrypt a plaintext file with just conventional cryptography, type:
          pgp -c textfile
      
     To decrypt an encrypted file, or to check the signature integrity of a
     signed file:
          pgp ciphertextfile [-o plaintextfile]
      
     To encrypt a message for any number of multiple recipients:
          pgp -e textfile userid1 userid2 userid3
      
     --- Key management commands:
      
     To generate your own unique public/secret key pair:
          pgp -kg
      
     To add a public or secret key file's contents to your public or
     secret key ring:
          pgp -ka keyfile [keyring]
      
     To extract (copy) a key from your public or secret key ring:
          pgp -kx userid keyfile [keyring]
     or:  pgp -kxa userid keyfile [keyring]
      
     To view the contents of your public key ring:
          pgp -kv[v] [userid] [keyring] 
      
     To view the "fingerprint" of a public key, to help verify it over 
     the telephone with its owner:
          pgp -kvc [userid] [keyring]
      
     To view the contents and check the certifying signatures of your 
     public key ring:
          pgp -kc [userid] [keyring] 
      
     To edit the userid or pass phrase for your secret key:
          pgp -ke userid [keyring]
      
     To edit the trust parameters for a public key:
          pgp -ke userid [keyring]
      
     To remove a key or just a userid from your public key ring:
          pgp -kr userid [keyring]
      
     To sign and certify someone else's public key on your public key ring:
          pgp -ks her_userid [-u your_userid] [keyring]
      
     To remove selected signatures from a userid on a keyring:
          pgp -krs userid [keyring]
      
     To permanently revoke your own key, issuing a key compromise 
     certificate:
          pgp -kd your_userid
      
     To disable or reenable a public key on your own public key ring:
          pgp -kd userid
      
     --- Esoteric commands:
      
     To decrypt a message and leave the signature on it intact:
          pgp -d ciphertextfile
      
     To create a signature certificate that is detached from the document:
          pgp -sb textfile [-u your_userid]
      
     To detach a signature certificate from a signed message:
          pgp -b ciphertextfile
      
     --- Command options that can be used in combination with other 
     command options (sometimes even spelling interesting words!):
      
     To produce a ciphertext file in ASCII radix-64 format, just add the
     -a option when encrypting or signing a message or extracting a key:
          pgp -sea textfile her_userid
     or:  pgp -kxa userid keyfile [keyring]
      
     To wipe out the plaintext file after producing the ciphertext file,
     just add the -w (wipe) option when encrypting or signing a message:
          pgp -sew message.txt her_userid
      
     To specify that a plaintext file contains ASCII text, not binary, and
     should be converted to recipient's local text line conventions, add
     the -t (text) option to other options:
          pgp -seat message.txt her_userid
      
     To view the decrypted plaintext output on your screen (like the
     Unix-style "more" command), without writing it to a file, use 
     the -m (more) option while decrypting:
          pgp -m ciphertextfile
      
     To specify that the recipient's decrypted plaintext will be shown
     ONLY on her screen and cannot be saved to disk, add the -m option:
          pgp -steam message.txt her_userid
      
     To recover the original plaintext filename while decrypting, add 
     the -p option:

          pgp -p ciphertextfile
      
     To use a Unix-style filter mode, reading from standard input and
     writing to standard output, add the -f option:
          pgp -feast her_userid <inputfile >outputfile

PGP can tell me if my newest version of F-PROT is valid, It can
sign my messages that if changed afterwards by another, will cause
a invalid message warning. Or if the message was not tampered with
would verify it as being untampered.

One can process a message with public key cryptography and get one
of three outputs: encrypted text, armored-signed messages, and
clear-signed messages.

For signing echomail use the -sta parameter and +clearsig in the config.txt

1. Clear-Signed Messages.  These are messages processed such that 
the text is not modified except for the addition of deliminator 
lines and a signature block.  The signature block contains digital 
information providing for the verification that the text contained 
within the deliminator lines has not been altered, and information 
identifying the person who signed the message.  The text can 
easily be read by anyone.  Verification that the message is intact 
as signed, and who originated it can be done by anyone using the 
proper program and a copy of the originator's public key.
 
2.  Armored-signed messages.    These are processed the same as an
clear-signed message, except an "armor" is added.  This make the
message harder to corrupt in transport, such as frequently happens
due to varying end-of-line definitions, but has the detriment that
no one can read the message without processing it through the
encryption program.  The "armor" is a process, similar to
uuencoding, that will make readily apparent if the message has been
tampered with.  It is not essential to the digital signature, but
makes the transport more "robust".  Like the clear-signed message,
since only the originator has the originator's private key, whoever
reads it, be it one or a thousand, knows that only the originator
could have sent it.

3.  Encrypted messages.  These are encrypted by the originator
using the *recipient's public key*.  Remember that by design, the
public key has been widely distributed so anyone can use it.  Due
to the nature of public key cryptography, only the intended
recipient can read this message.

==========================[NEW  TOPIC]==========================================

1) The ECPA *DOES* apply to the BBSes whether they want it to or not.
   All the hoping in the world doesn't make a statute go away. Merely
   declaring that the ECPA doesn't apply to you doesn't work -- try
   declaring the tax laws don't apply to you some time and see if that
   works.
2) The BBS operators are NOT liable UNLESS they censor the mail. If
   they censor the mail, they are liable for anything they fail to
   censor. If they do not censor, they are COMMON CARRIERs, and have
   no liability.

First of all, there are many BBSs that do
offer truly private mail, or whose sysops, as a matter of policy, do not
read others' private mail. Secondly, there's no legal liability associated
with allowing e-mail privacy. Third, federal law (the ECPA) bars
sysops from examining mail except under some very precisely defined
circumstances.

(taken from a EPCA discussion on liability of BBS sysops)

Which brings up another mis understood term. "Secured Mail"

Secured mail is a FIDOnet group of sysops that have organized
to route mail that is encrypted and un-censored.
It seems to me that sounds like the definition of COMMON CARRIERs?

Below is a message I found in the "secured mail" echo I found very
close to the truth in viewing the secured mail network in the light.

Subj: SecureMail Hosts vs FidoNet Hosts

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

  This is a reminder especially applicable to those who are new to 
SecureMail.

  We are not at odds with the FidoNet Host hierarchy.  There is 
not any ongoing disagreement, amnity, or other ill feelings, nor 
is there a dissagreement in principal between us.

  Many of the FidoNet Hosts agree with us, many would be 
SecureMail hosts themselves if they could.  But it is impossible 
for some Hosts to perform both positions.  A FidoNet Host 
(especially an RC) has to route to Hosts that have not adopted our 
SecureMail principals, there is not anyway around this save 
resigning the FidoNet Host position, which should not be done!

  In Fidonet, one individual in the position of Host, who refuses 
to offer a particular class of service, can prevent the others 
from doing so.  It takes agreement of all concerned, as well as 
cooperation of them all to make changes.  Until the whole of 
Fidonet agrees with our principals, we will have the 
responsibility for SecureMail, and our cause is served best by 
encouraging, and cooperating with those holding FidoNet Host 
positions - especially those who agree with our principals.

  We may be "rebels" in FidoNet... but not everyone disagrees with 
us, and those who do, are fewer than you might think.

=======================================================================


PGP config.txt
==============

Multiple Config.txt (pgp cfg) selections can be used by saving a backup
of that config.txt and copying it when needed.
Examples; using PGPshell, a whole different setup in config.txt is needed
than what I prefer from the command line or in batches. No problem In the
batch copys the saved config.sav (you should edit the batch files!)

 
Also note the call to two outside utilities:

FDATE and Qedit
===============

I call Qedit with a macro (qedit macro) to cut the header off the message and
start the message a line above the BEGIN PGP starting line.
This looks better when sending signed messages, why duplicate the header?

===============

And FDATE adds logging text and dates to messages as well as a PGP log.

===============

Below is the Qedit macro. Type PGP and the filename to uncompress it
and the password is PGP
(this binary file was processed with PGP 64 radix command)
You will want to turn your VERBOSE=2 and INTERACTIVE=ON in PGP coonfig.txt
before extracting the messages below. This way you will know the original
name of the message file. Type in the original name for the output filename.

The macro can be dissasembled with Qedits QMAC to show only deletion of the
header in a message loaded by qedit (no directory or filenames are in it).
PGP message contains "noheader.bin" used by QEDIT.exe (external editor)
Password is PGP

================= Macros batch files =================

All of the above batch files can be extracted by running
this file thru PGP
Password is lowercase   pgp
You will want to turn your VERBOSE=2 and INTERACTIVE=ON in PGP coonfig.txt
before extracting the messages below. This way you will know the original
name of the message file. Type in the original name for the output filename.

ATTENTION!
ALL THE BELOW BATCH FILES NEED TO BE CHANGED TO YOUR EXACT
