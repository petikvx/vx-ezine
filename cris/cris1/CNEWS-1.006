       Well virus fans, when we last left you a battle was raging in
       the virus echo. Geno Paris was claiming moderatorship of the
       echo and gating it to his Cris\NuKE buddies. Edwin Cleton was
       mad as hell and his blood pressure rising in a seemingly vain
       attempt to get the echo back from Geno who had Elisted it and
       was making life miserable for Cleton.

       What can one say about it? It has been great anarchy friends,
       and I have personally enjoyed it. It looks like that each side
       is going their own separate ways as these posts from Mr. Cleton
       and Mr. Paris would suggest:

The final chapter.

I have given the zone star 1:209/209 a final chance to comply with my request,
if he doesn't, zone 1 will be disconnected as of 1 november 1993 according to
fidonet routing, to which I see no change today.

When zone 1 successfully has been disconnected, a new alternate routing will be
setup to accommodate any zone 1 node with this echo, with the current situation
in zone 1 I am left with no other option.

Re: Virus Echo sites
St: Local

As I posted earlier the Virus echo is leaving the backbone you can pick up the
true virus echo at the following sites:

These sites are edited here by the Cris Staff, and this note is added.
Note: The following is a clip from the Crisnet nodelist. _Not_ all of these 
sites have stated that they will cary the echo. But they do pickup Crisnet 
mail so they will be able to tag the area for you.

It is still unclear as to what Fido has in mind for the echo. Gene was told 
it was going to be removed from the backbone, so if it comes to this, Cris 
will help all that they can to keep it going. Also we feel it is good 
reading. I myself enjoy the echo with Gene Paris as the moderator, and in
talking to him he has the desire to continue moderating it, so we will 
continue feeding it to everyone that wants to join in it.

I must add that I netmailed Edwin Cleton direct asking him his views
with no reply as of yet. I had hoped to find out more info as to the US
and the systems already getting the Fido virus mail, and what plans he 
had if any for routing. Seeing I got no reply I assume he has no desire
to deal with re-routing the mail at this time. So I feel it would be good 
to act now before loosing the connection to those that are connecting and 
want to continue receiving the virus mail.

If you want to find a close site from the list below, you can ask the sysop 
at that location if they will tag the echo for you. All they will need to 
do is netmail me and I will add the mail to there current Crisnet mail if
they want.


(Additionally it will soon be on the Worldnet backbone as WN_VIRUS_POL)

       So friends be sure and pick up the real Virus echo at one of
       these fine sites. Also be sure and send Mr. Cleton a message
       concerning his being a anal retentive character in drastic need
       of a laxative :)

BOOT TO THE HEAD
     -KWI CHANG CAIN

       Oh and friends, here is a recipe from my good friend Chef Ansehl
       Ronygos:



                 MUNCHIE HEMP BROWNIE PIE

     4 eggs                          1/2 packed brown sugar
     1 (4 oz) baar sweet cooking     1/4 Not enough room here for this one.
     chocolate, melted and cooled    1/2 c. granulated sugar
     1/2 c. bisquick baking mix      1/4 c. margarine or butter
     3/4 c. chopped nuts

     Heat oven to 350. Grease 9 inch pie plate. Beat all ingredients,
     except nuts, until smooth, 2 minutes in blender on high, stopping
     blender occasionally to stir, or 2 minutes with hand beater. Pour
     into plate sprinkle with nuts. Bake until knife inserted in center
     comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool 5 minutes. Check for DEA
     agents before eating.

     Serve with ice cream, if desired.

WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO BE THE GIRL?
