Thanks in advance for any responses, please circulate this survey to 
whomever you think may be interested in responding. I am particularly 
interested in non-power pc users, and blue collar workers. thank you.


These questions are being asked to help document how different people
perceive various aspects of the virus problem. Any and all responses
will be appreciated. It is not necessary to include any identifying
information, but you can if you wish. Affiliation/Position would be
appreciated, such as Virus Writer, Virus Exchange BBS Sysop, Virus
Collector, Professor of Law, Student of Psychology, etc.

I've asked these general questions before, so if you responded then, I
would still appreciate another response now. People change their ideas
on all of this from time to time, so I'm trying to get a current
perspective :)

Responses can be e-mailed via Fidonet 1:227/190, Internet vfr@netcom.com
or SGordon@Dockmaster.ncsc.mil, or Virnet 9:10/0. Paper mail responses
are also appreciated, at the address P.O. Box 11417 South Bend, Indiana
46624. You may directly upload your answers via modem, if you wish, to
219-273-2431; logon survey , password survey.

Thank you very much for the continued assistance so many of you have
given in the past!

1. Laws addressing computer viruses vary from location to location. Are
you familiar with the laws of your country? If so, can you tell me what
laws specifically address the virus problem? Please be as specific as
possible.

2. Do you know of anyone who has been prosecuted under any portion of
any law pertaining to computer viruses? If so, please give as much
detail as you know regarding charges, sentencing, recidivism, etc.

3. Are you familiar with the term 'incitement'? If so, how do you feel
about this portion of law that many countries are now adopting?

4. Please tell me how you view this statement. "If it is not illegal to
do it, it is ok to do it". Specifically, since it is legal in many
places to put viruses on a BBS for anyone to take, with no restrictions,
do you think this is an o.k. thing to do? Why or why not?

5. Please define "Responsible" behaviour relating to distribution of
viruses.

6. Please define "Computer Virus Researcher", paying special attention
to the term Researcher :). What is a researcher? What qualification and
responsibilities does a Researcher have?

7. What is the function of INTERPOL as you understand it?

8. Which branch of governments that you are aware of deal with computer
viruses, if any? This can be from your own country or from any country
that you are familiar with. What is the function of the branch/division
you are aware of.

9. Do you feel the trend in legislation against computer virus exchange
bbs will continue to grow? Do you think it is a healthy trend?

10. Do you think laws in other countries are applicable in cyberspace,
where there are no formal territorial boundaries?

11. Have you ever taken a class relating to ethics? If so, at what grade
level. Did the class specifically address ethical behaviours as relate
to computing environments? Please define the word "ethics", i.e. what
does this mean to you personally.

The source of all information will be publicly available unless you
specifically state you do NOT want your name used, so please, make sure
you specify if you do NOT want your name or any identifying information
used. If you do not want your name used, and say so :), any info you
give will be presented like "a virus writer from argentina" or
"professor of history from china", i.e., generic. If this is still too
broad for your liking, please specify to not include any reference to
you personally.

Laws are being tossed about daily, globally that could have far more
reaching impact than I ever realised. I am interested to know what other
people are thinking and doing to help stop this from happening.

Also, if you have a resource file, text file, paper, article, or any
information related to any of the above areas, I would appreciate
receiving a copy. Please circulate these questions to anyone and
anyplace you feel may have an interest in responding. Thanks :)
