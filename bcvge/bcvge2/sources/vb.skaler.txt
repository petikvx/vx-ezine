Rip it off, kids : Presenting VB.SKALER by alcopaul  \\\\\
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

all of my previous worms uses outlook to propagate via e-mail... one time, i revisited my past and viewed my old creations 
and thought that i'm really a lame ass then.... but not anymore... :D

This is my first SMTP worm that sends itself to the e-mail addresses contained in htm and html files located in
Temporary Internet Files folder... And the first SMTP Visual Basic worm to be featured in an e-zine, i think 
(Slap me if i'm thinkin' wrongly...  :) I've modified PetiK's technique of collecting e-mail addresses (Thankie PetiK! :) ),
so the collected e-mail addresses will be a valid e-mail addy... If the collected e-mail addy contains "?", it will be
replaced by a bogus e-mail addy, but with a valid syntax...

I was thinkin of putting the MIME sploit in here but i thought that it would not be cool coz the sploit is too way archaic..
:P... Waiting for the automatic execution via HTML sploit... heheheheheh

and also thankie to a VB programmer (you know who you are.. just look at b64 function.. :) ) for the base64 routine....

i'm expecting to break even with the number of VC++ smtp worms.... it depends to you, VB enthusiasts... you can
enhance this code.. put some Internet Connexion Checking and stuff... Check the registry for some smtp server, sender
name and e-mail addy... cool payloads... file infection.. backdoor capabilities... keylogging... etc....

"Watch out, VB worms are coming to your mailboxes!"

TADA! Rip it off, kids... hehheheheh
