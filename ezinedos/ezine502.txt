                    They wear black clothes, pray to Satan,
                    burn down churches, and murder people.
                    Welcome to my record collection. 

                    Starting in the early eighties as a
                    gimmick-flavored synthesis of classic
                    Metal's dark, horror-film aesthetics with raw
                    thrash music, Black Metal has evolved into
                    a widespread, harsh-sounding subgenre
                    whose lyrics and imagery invoke occultism,
                    misanthropy and severe anti-Christian
                    sentiments. 

                    When the intial wave of evil thrash
                    innovators, including Celtic Frost and the
                    mighty Venom, declined and subsided, a
                    new generation of fiercely dedicated fans
                    took up Satan's mantle, and this morbid
                    vision of youthful rebellion mutated into
                    something like an ideology. In Norway, a
                    small but fervent underground Black Metal
                    scene quickly grew violent around 1992, as
                    members of well-known bands in that
                    country became involved in a wave of
                    church burnings, suicide, and murder. At
                    the same time, some image-conscious
                    scene kingpins incited the media with
                    unapologetic messages of hatred, nihilism,
                    and, in many instances, racist sentiments.
                    Since this time, similar events linked to the
                    Black Metal underground have taken place
                    in Germany, the US, Russia and
                    elsewhere. In Lords of Chaos, an excellent
                    book documenting the phenomenon in
                    great depth, Michael Moynihan reports
                    that, to date, nearly a hundred churches
                    worldwide have been burned or desecrated
                    by fanatical Black Metalers. 

                    Needless to say, the infamy and record
                    sales of the musicians involved in such
                    bizarre sociopathic behavior have only
                    increased. Despite losing various members
                    to the Reaper or the jailer, all of the
                    seminal Norwegian bands of the 1992-1993
                    era continue playing to this day.The music
                    produced by these Satanists and fringe
                    dwellers is cold, fast, and ugly. The
                    symbolism (inverted crosses, "corpse
                    paint" and spikes) is unsurprising and
                    almost laughable. The lyrics variously
                    speak of the icy majesty of the Northern
                    landscape, battle rage, cosmic mystery,
                    and of course, the eminence of the Goat
                    Lord in all his guises. Scandinavian metal
                    acts also identify heavily with their Viking
                    ancestry, so there's plenty of Odinism,
                    Tolkien, and mythological references for the
                    thoughtful Metal head . 

                    Groups as incongruous as Rastsfarians
                    and White Power Skinheads have clearly
                    defined styles of music that serve as a
                    soundtrack for their chosen subcultural
                    statement, but the scope of Black Metal's
                    anger is alarming. Despite the brutal
                    actions and opinions associated with Black
                    Metal, its irresistable sensationalism brings
                    increasing attention from young music
                    fans. So if your kid comes home with an
                    inverted cross around his neck and his face
                    is made up to look like a corpse but it's not
                    Halloween, you might want to hide the
                    matches and take a peek at his CD
                    collection, just to get an idea where he's
                    coming from. Marilyn Manson is a pale
                    fake in comparison to the evil in action of
                    bands like Burzum, Mayhem, and
                    Emperor. Links to their home pages are
                    provided below.
