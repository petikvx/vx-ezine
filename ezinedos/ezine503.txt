 thoughts for the future
<----------------------

    the way in a new century knocks on the door. our generation gets 
compared with what we have done and with what we are going to change. not
the fear of the future, of the problems we will have to solve, of the tiny 
possibilities we have for our revolution, should rule us. The possibility
if changing and of creating should inspire us.

    we are on our way to get global men. the global man will distinguish 
himself through is understanding. his work, his tolerance his strife for 
learning and helping will make the future to his underling. It will be the
mix of his real life and his virtual presence that will mark his life.

    these properties will help him, cause there are some rules of the net.
they don't care about your race, your sex, your knowledge or your age. the
thoughts are free... only the thoughts count. the tolerance and not the 
ignorance is the base of our community.

    we, that think and work like this, will form the humen with our thoughts.
there will be a new order, very soon, that will be formed by the people of
the net. it is also necessary to help those that do not already have the 
possibility of helping us to change the world. we are the beginning. let us 
begin to form the world to a better one. lets write tolerance on our flags 
and lets lay down our weapons. break down the walls and work together not
against the other ones. we and the ones that will follow us have to support
the new base together. lets acknowledge ourselves as that what we are as 
the ones that will try to change the world to something better. 

    we have to create our own little world so that we can work together and 
that we can save our individuality. But we mustn't do this at the pain of 
someone else.

    yes... i will make the begining. If you join me, if you agree to my 
thoughts or if you tolerate me... all these possibilities are one step 
ahead. you can't... no you should correct me. everyone counts and everyone 
is involved. it is necessary noone can be excluded. 

    My thoughts are the future, my work is the beginning.
    Keep these words in your heart. 

    Be as I am and make your own beginning. Join our revolution and help us
saving everyones freedom. Help us to keep the world from its end, the control
through a few individuals.

    I am rising my voice against the exclusion the control the limitation 
and the restriction of men. i want to change it.. i say it, i want to stop
the stream of hate and fear. i stop it.

i want to be a pioneer for our future... come and help me to make it better!
