                          HTML-Beginner압 Tutorial

  <----------/\---------------------------------------------/\---------->

    The first thing you should know about HTML is...Throw away ALL your 
WebPage-Editors!!! The only program you need is your notepad! 

Let압 start!

O.K....HTML is a programming lanquage like all the others too...you gotta 
learn a few "tags" and you앏l be able to write your own homepage...you 
don앖 believe? let압 find it out!

As mentioned above, HTML uses tags...tags are always written between 
<> ...an example: <b>hello</b> produces hello...that means it makes the 
word "hello" bold...

The layout of your page depends on you... You can have <b>bold</b> and 
<i>italicized,</i> <fontsize="+1">Larger</font> and <fontsize="-1">smaller,
or it could look <tt>type-written.</tt><br>...

Every html code has to  start with a <html>! That압 a must!!!

So what are all the "<" and ">" doing here? When you place a certain thing
within these, you are making something known as a tag. For example the </b> 
tag is saying to stop bold text. The tag with the slash (/) is known as the
closing tag. Many opening tags require a following closing tag, but not all
do. Tags make up the entire structure of an HTML document.

Note: Tages in HTML are NOT case sensitive. For example... <title> and 
<TiTlE> are interpreted by web browsers as being the same thing.

Here are some tags you can use for your page:

Headings
 Headings are some of the most important tags within the BODY of your HTML
 document. You will usuall use a heading to tell what the following section
 of your page is about. The opening tag for a heading is <hy> and the 
 closing tag is </hy> with y being the size of the heading, from 1 to 6 
 (1 being largest and 6 being smallest).

Horizontal Ruled Lines
  Horizontal Ruled Lines are used to separate different areas of a web page.
  The tag for a horizontal ruled line is the <hr> tag. The horizontal ruled
  line DOES NOT have a closing tag. You may also add certain attributes to
  the <hr> tag, such as WIDTH=n (for fixed pixel width) or WIDTH=n% for a 
  certain percentage of the screen wide, SIZE=n to make the line a certain
  pixel amount thick, and NOSHADE to turn the line's shading off. A plain
  <ht> tag with no attributes will make the line the full width of the 
  screen.

Align Tags
 Many tags support ALIGN attributes. Basically what this tag does is 
 aligns text wherever you want it to be aligned (center, left, or right).




The Line Break
 When a HTML document is viewed, line breaks (going to another line) do not
 occur by themselves. To make a line break, one must use the <br> tag. This
 tag does not have any closing tag (</>).

Preformatted Text
 If you want to line text up properly, using the space key, it would not 
 generally work. In this case, the <pre> and </pre> tags are very useful.

The Center Tag
 The center tag is used many times to make a page look more organized. The 
 opening center tag is <center> and the closing tag is </center>. Whatever
 is inbetween the two tags will be centered.

Links and Images
 Links... Without links, the Web wouldn't be a web! To add a link you would
 use the <a href="http://www.servername.com"> and the </a> closing tag. Any
 text between the two different tags would be highlighted.

Usually links are used to go to other internet sites, but they can also be
used to have an e-mail link. To do this, replace the internet address 
(http://www.servername.com) with "mailto:emailaddress@server.com".

Images
 As you know, most web pages have images (pictures) on them. YOU can also
 add pictures to your pages (only .gif, .jpg, or .jpeg)! To do this you 
  would use the <img src="http://www.servername.com">.

Note: The <img src> tag doesn't have a closing tag.

Combining Links and Images
 Many times people want to make pictures into links, so that when clicked 
 on, will to go another page. To do this, simply put the <img src> tag 
 between the <a href> and </a> tags.

Body Attributes
 The body tag has many attributes. Here are some of the most useful ones:

   <body background="http://www.servername.com/picname.gif"> - Background 
                                                               Image

   <body bgcolor="#hexadecimalcolor"> - Hexadecimal color code for 
                                        background color

   <body link="#hexadecimalcolor"> - Hexadecimal color code for unvisited
                                     links

   <body vlink="#hexadecimalcolor"> - Hexadecimal color code for visited 
                                    links

   <body text="#hexadecimalcolor"> - Hexadecimal color code for text

 Hexadecimal colors are very simple to use. All they are are a combination
 of letters and numbers that form a color. Here are the most common 
 hexadecimal colors:

                                 #ff0000 - Red

                                #00ff00 - Green

                                 #0000ff - Blue

  #000000 - You wouldn't be able to see black text on a black background, 
 but this is the hexadecimal code for black...

Well...that압 it! You are now able to write your first (simple) webpage!
Easy, isn앖 it? I hope you find this little tutorial useful...
