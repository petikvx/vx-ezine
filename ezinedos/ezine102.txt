Removing a cd-check
hello folks...

...
    i am a member of the LineZerO crew, an austrian crack and virii crew.
this here is the 2nd article i write for our e-zine.
as i am a newbie in cracking, i' m writing this tutorial in order to
teach others that do absolutely not know how to crack a program and in
order to find someone that can teach me a better way of cracking this
program... so if you read this and think you know a better or just 
another way to crack this program, it would be cool if you sent me
a tutorial to  iarragon_lzo@yahoo.com    or to  lzo.crew@gmx.net  .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> WHAT IS THIS GOING TO BE????

i think this will be a tutor on HOW TO CRACK A CD-CHECK. i will first
explain how this works in general and then give you an example of it
with anno1602 you can also find it in the e-zine here...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK... how does this work in general?

the following lines will try to explain it to you...

GOOD CODE

GOOD CODE
CALL A FUNCTION THAT CHECKS IF THE CD IS AN ORIGINAL
IF IT IS THEN JUMP TO A GOOD PLACE, ELSE GO ON
                    |
BAD CODE            |
BAD MSGBOX          |

GOOD PLACE <---------

can you imagine this? the program runs as it would always run, till it calls
a function that checks if your CD is ok or if it is a burned one. if your CD
is the original one, a jump will bring you to the good code and the game
will run without problems... but if you don't have an original cd the
jump won't be done and you step right into the bad code with the bad msg
(eg. please put the original CD in your CD-drive) or smth like this....

what will you do if you find this kind of protection? 
there will be a 'je' or a 'jne' that jumps to the good place if your cd
is ok. if you change this 'je' or 'jne' to a 'jmp' the programme won't
only jump to the good place if the cd is orig. it would also jump if the
cd is not original...even if it is not inserted...ok?

so REMEMBER: if you find this protection....you have to kill the 'je'
or 'jne' and put a 'jmp' that always jumps instead of it!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

another protection you can often find is

GOOD CODE

CALL A FUNCTION THAT CHECKS THE CD ORIGINALITY
IF IT IS AN ORIGINAL GO ON, ELSE JUMP TO THE BAD CODE
GOOD CODE
GOOD CODE
GOOD CODE

BAD CODE
BAD CODE

i think you will understand this example too...

how can you handle this protection????
here would be a 'je' or a 'jne' that would jump if your cd is not an
original.... ok what can we do now... hm... i would suggest we nop
the jump! what does nop mean??? NOP = No OPeration = do nothing!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


so how can you hook a game that uses this kind of protection???
you can try to run the game without the cd in the drive or 
with a burned CD...  

then you will get a msg that says that you have to insert the
original cd or something like this...

now you disassemble the .exe and look in the string refs for the
msg you got.... if you double click the string in eg w32dasm you
are warped to some place in the code... where?? hm... normally 
you will land in the bad code part!  look at my example! ;)

good code
good code
good code
call cd check routine
jump over bad code to the good code

bad code ;  you would normally land here if you hook like i told it
bad code ; then you would step upwards where the bad code is possibly
bad code ; called and change the jump or whatever it is the way i
         ; explained it first...  easy..isn't it?? not always ;[
good code
good code
good code


ok that must be enough for you to crack some of the easy cd-check 
protections... i found a tutor that explained how to generally crack
this kind of protections and so i was able to do my first crack...;)

i hope this tutor helps you to do some cracks too.... if you have
any questions or aditions or whatever please contact me at
iarragon_lzo@yahoo.com

thanx to you for reading my tutor :)

for an example look at the 'cracks' section...
