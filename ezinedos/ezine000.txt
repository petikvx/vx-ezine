    First I would like to welcome you to LineZer0 Networks first e-zine! 
For all who don't know what LineZer0 is or does, are here some short infor-
mations. We, the LineZer0 Network are a group of crackers, virus writers 
and 'normal' coders who want to find new technics in coding and of course
we want to help newbies to start. We are all also mainly newbies and our
main goal is to help others and get better for ourselfs. So if something
isn't perfect in your eyes, plz give us a chance...;) In our issues will 
always be two kind of articles. Some for newbies and some for the advanced
ppl. So this was a short introduction to LineZer0. If you share our ideas 
and also want to help newbies or find new technics, feel free and send an 
email to our main address. We are always searching for new members! So if 
you think you are the right, try it! Due we are now present in the internet,
we got a new member, Black Jack welcome in our team and I hope that we will 
do a lot together!


    Our articles will be a mix of articles about virus writing(asm & vba),
cracking, normal coding, news, weird stories and some miscellaneous stuff. 
If you have any comments or articles, please send it to us! This mix of 
articles will be the same in future issues of our e.zine except we loose
the coders of one genre ;) K, I hope you like this and keep reading our new
zine.


    In our first issue HeX Crasher and Nostradamus will show you the basics
in cracking, Black Jack, Zero and me will show you how to write virii, our
teammates of the Application Team will show you the basics in HTML and some
other stuff. We have also some fine source codes ;) written by us or our
friends. And last but not least, our trial member Crazy Guru will search 
the worldwideweb for some interesting sites. There will always be a few
weird stories or food for your brain! So if you have some article you want
to publish or some source, feel free and send it us, we will publish it in
our next issue.


    So the fact is that LineZer0 is probably a new group, so don't expect 
to much for our first articles, but the main thing is, have fun while read-
ing our articles!


    We had a lot of time problems with making this issue so we can't offer
you everything we wanted to put in this zine. We had to cut a lot of things
planned for this issue but time was the enemy this time...but we hope we
can offer you here a few interessting things.


    In the end of this first editorial the crew and me would like to thank
the following people who helped LineZer0 in our first days on internet:
§Tally §Slage Hammer §Cicatrix §The Might §VBuster and all others we forgot, 
you know who you are! Thanks ppl!
