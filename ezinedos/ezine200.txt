hello folks...

this here is a part of a large tutorial on removing time protections. But
without the theoretical stuff and without  the protection-schemes and with-
out the backgrounds of asm and this stuff. You can get the complete tutorial
on our page at http://beam.to/lzo or in our e-zine #2. So this here will
only deal with the cracking of the 30 day evaluation of 

ANIMAGIC GIF Animator V. 1.05 32 Bit Version .... 


Here we go ->

First of all check the programme out and think of its protection.
Hm, you can see, that you're dealing with a 30 day evaluation copy of the 
programme. If the 30 days are over, you can't save the .gif files anymore.
In the HELP file, you can read, that if you register the copy, you get a 
reg-code. With this reg-code you can enable the save buttons also after 30 
days. 

So what will you do now. You could try to crack the key-protection. You 
could hack the key. Or you could simply disable the 30 day evaluation 
protection. As all the functions work if you are in the 30 day evaluation,
we will only disable the counter, that counts the days that animagic was 
used.

For this crack, you will need SoftIce, w32dasm and a heXeditor.
And you should know how to work with these tools.
If you don't know this, get the complete tutorial!

But you will learn also something out of this tutor, if you are a complete
beginner.

Press CTRL-D to get into Softice. Then enter 'bpx getlocaltime'. This here
is a breakpoint that hooks, if the API-function getlocaltime is used. Some
Programmes use this API function to get the time of your computer. But there
are a lot of other API functions that can be used to get this.

Then run the programme. You will soon be back in SoftIce. Now you are in the
KERNEL32. You can read this at the bottom of SoftIces code window. Now press
Ctrl-D again till you can read animagic32! here instead of Kernel32!. Got it?
I have to press Ctrl-D once to get there. 

Ok... where are you now? now you are in the GETLOCALTIME-function of your 
computers Kernel. So press F12 to get back there, where this function was 
called. You should now land one command behind the call to the GETLOCALTIME-
function in the animagic32.exe . 

Now the tactic normally is: Search the cmp that compares the install-date and
the local date, and patch it...  but here it is a bit easier... ;) Here it is
enough, if you noop the call to the GETLOCALTIME. And how can we do this now??
Set a new breakpoint, one command before the call to the getlocaltime... here 
on my 'puter it is 

'bpx 0137:0046D3C1  50   Push       EAX' .

the address may be different on your computer. Then disable the breakpoint on 
getlocaltime (bd 0). Now press Ctrl-D till you get out of SoftIce. Then close 
Animagic. 

Restart Animagic now. Softice will pop up again, and you are where you set the 
breakpoint before. The next command is the call to the getlocaltime. Now step 
with F10 till you are exactly at the CALL. This call has 5 bytes as you can see.
We want to noop this CALL. As the nop only has 1 byte, you have to make 5 nops, 
that the call is away... this is clear, isn't it? 

if you don't know what a nop is... this is the 'DO NOTHING' command in asm.
read the complete tutorial to hear more about this ;) .

so type in 'a' and press enter. now you can enter your own commands for the 
address you are at. so type now 'nop' and press enter. make this 5 times at
all. then press ESC and then Ctrl-D till you get back to animagic. And what
can you see? The nag-screen doesn't tell you to REGISTER anymore and you can
save your .gif s again....  but... what if you don't want to make this every
time you start animagic?????  RIGHT! you have to patch it! 

OK... just do all the stuff again, but write down the heXcode of the call to
 getlocaltime and the command before and after it. On my 'puter this is:

50 E858010000  0FB755FC

Now search for this number with your heXeditor... i used hworks32 to do this.
When you found it, replace the E858010000 with 9090909090. Do you know why? 
Because 90 is the 'nop' command in heXadecimal. and AGAIN... why do you have
to write 5 times 90? Because the call has 5 bytes! (1 byte is 2 numbers ...;)

Now.. if you didn't make too much mistakes, you should be able to use animagic
GIF V.1.05 32Bit Version  forever. ;)

- - - - - - - - - ---- - - - - -- - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - -- -- - -  -- - -  - - - - ----  - -------

here is the code for a patch for it!
only use this for Version 1.05.. it probably won't work for another Version...

ok... now.. I hope you enjoyed this little tutorial. Please note, that 
normally my tutorials are more precious and that they normally contain more
theoretical stuff, so that you can really learn something out of them... 
well my older ones don't, but the few new ones do... and in future will do!
:) Ok... so try to get the complete tutorial from our page http://beam.to/lzo 

If you find errors, or have questions, or something like this, just contact
me! If you want to join us, contact me or the crew at lzo.crew@gmx.net or
iarragon_lzo@yahoo.com . Austrian crackers are very welcome! We are austrians
too! But every other one is also very welcome!   OK....   that's it.... thanks
for reading my tutor!
