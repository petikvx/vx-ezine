Most of people think that collecting viruses is one of many hobbies like
collecting stamps. But I have collected viruses, Because I have the purpose
to reaseach viruses and know how to protect a system from their attack.

  for how long were you inactive?, why did you stop?, why did you decide
  to continue?

yes, for a month, most of people in my country think that it is a bad thing
like virus' author makes a virus. But I am assured of it is not a bad thing.

yes, But they don't exactly know what it is.

- Do you consider necessary to avoid telling people you collect viruses? If
  yes, why?

no

- Do you avoid trading with any collector? If yes, who and what are the
  reasons?

Not yet, As soon as possible i will try to trade viruses with all traders in
the world.

- Is there any virus collector that you admire for any reason? If yes, who
  and what are the reasons to admire him?

Germano, SlageHammer, TRNEY and my friend, When i start to collect viruses, i
have received many help from them. for example, how to remove a fake sample,
what to use tool making log, etc...

- Did you ever work for an antivirus company?

Sometimes i have sent some viruses which my av programs can't detect. 
But I don't support all viruses to av company.

- Did you ever trade with an antivirus company or an antivirus researcher?

Well, I don't know that.

- Do you keep stuff that you can not/do not want to trade?

yes,I have some files called rare, but I will send all viruses to my best vx
friends even if they are rare. I am assured of they know what a rare mean.

- Did you ever exchange your complete virus collection with other collector?

Not yet.

- In your opinion, what is the best and what is the worst antivirus scanner?
  Why?

Hmm..Well,, i think kav, nav, mcafee, pc-cillin are the best antiviruses.
Specially, kav have many functions that various excuting packers, many
database to detect viruses, easy interface for users.

Also Nav, When a new variant of begle which has polymorphic and infect a
normal file is reported in the world, According to My researching expirenece,
Nav exactly detected all files infected by bagle as W32.Beagle.gen@mm. Though
Kav could it, Kav detected only as Type_Win32. So i think nav is one of the
best.

i don't know the rests are the worst or not.

No

- How is your collection sorted and stored? Do you keep viruses compressed or
  uncompressed? What is the directory structure?

My collection is sorted as crc32 and is uncompressed, i rename all files with
their CRC32 because is useful to avoid dupes.

- Do you make backups of your collection? If yes, How often and what is the
  media you use to make backups?

I have stored my viruses on my second hdd and cd-r by the months.

- Did you used to use VS2000 package tools before it became viriiware? If
  yes, what is your opinion about the change from freeware to viriiware?,
  Did you continue using VS2000 package tools after the change?

yes, Well, i think if all traders use viriiware, they need to donate some
viruses for viriiware's author. Then Viriiware's author will make a useful
tool more than currently using viriiware. But don't force it and it is up to
all traders.

- What is your opinion about the viriiware?

Plsease, See the above answer about this question.

- Your greetings, if any, go here:

Thank you for all traders who trade with me. Specailly, Germano, SlageHammer,
TRNEY, NexusC, some others... Many computers have been attacked from viruses,
users have losted all their files like data, movie, picture, etc. So i will
continue to collect viruses for researching viruses and finding the effective
ways to protect a system from viruses' attack.

Have a nice day!
