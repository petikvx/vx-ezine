- How old are you? Where do you come from?

19 y/o from Italy

- Why did you start collecting viruses?

When my computer was infected for the first time I discovered 3 viruses on my 
pc so I thought that on the web there were a lot of them. In this way I
started my collection.

- For how long have you been collecting viruses?

Since 2001.

- Did you ever stop trading viruses and continued after a time? If yes, for
  how long were you inactive?, why did you stop?, why did you decide to
  continue?

Yes, sometimes I stopped to trade. I was inactive for few months and I think 
to will be inactive again in the future. There are different reasons but I want 
always continue.

- What are your virus statistics actually? (AVP/F-Prot/... unique/total)

For AVP: 18588 unique
For F-Prot: 12352 unique
For RAV: 15969 unique

- What antivirus do you usually use for making logs? Do you use any other
  antivirus from time to time? If yes, what are them?

I'm using AVP 4.5, F-Prot and RAV, all for Windows.

- Do the people near you (parents, friends, ...) know you collect viruses?

Only 3 people: my sister, one my friend and my ex-girlfriend.

- Do you consider necessary to avoid telling people you collect viruses? If
  yes, why?

Yes, because other people have bad opinion about viruses so they could 
think that I'm an hacker.

- Do you avoid trading with any collector? If yes, who and what are the
  reasons?

Usually I trade always with the same traders. When I want to begin to trade
with unknown traders (or they want to begin to trade with me) I ask to other
traders if they know him.

- Is there any virus collector that you admire for any reason? If yes, who
  and what are the reasons to admire him?

Yes, Germano. He lives in my country and he helps me very often.

- Did you ever work for an antivirus company?

I didn't, but sometimes I cooperate with them sending them some suspicious 
files found in the wild

- Did you ever trade with an antivirus company or an antivirus researcher?

I didn't

- Do you keep stuff that you can not/do not want to trade?

I trade everything I have.

- Did you ever exchange your complete virus collection with other collector?

No, I never exchanged my complete collection.

- In your opinion, what is the best and what is the worst antivirus scanner?
  Why?

The best antivirus scanners are AVP/KAV (but it's slow on my old pc) and RAV
(very fast on my old pc!). About the worst... I don't know.

- What is the program you use to process logs?

I use VS2000 to process logs

- What is the program you use to rename files?

I use RENFILES to rename in CRC32; RENEXTS and EXTSCAN for correct extensions.

- What is the program you use to sort your collection?

I use VS2000.

- Do you check for fake viruses? If yes, what is the program you use for
  doing that?

Yes, I check fake viruses with FAKESCAN and VIRWEED.

- Do you use any additional program for doing any virus collecting task? If
  yes, what are those programs and what they do?

I use FWEED to check fakes, parts and corrupted.

- How is your collection sorted and stored? Do you keep viruses compressed or
  uncompressed? What is the directory structure?

My collection is sorted as Bulk Style. The files are uncompressed.
I rename all files with their CRC32 because is useful to avoid dupes.

- Do you make backups of your collection? If yes, How often and what is the
  media you use to make backups?

Yes, I make backups of my collection every month on rewritable CDs.

- Did you used to use VS2000 package tools before it became viriiware? If
  yes, what is your opinion about the change from freeware to viriiware?,
  Did you continue using VS2000 package tools after the change?

I used the public version of VS2000. I think that the change from freeware to
viriiware is a good idea.

- What is your opinion about the viriiware?

I think that viriiware is a good idea, developers must be compensate of their
job.

I thank all people who are tradind with me!
