                  ---------------------------------------


   Most traders  (all?) have  fake and/or false positives virus  samples in
their collections.

   Just to refresh concepts:

   A fake virus is a file created or forged on  purpose to be detected by a
specified antivirus. Some  well known  fake virus generators  were coded by
Vecna or Z0MBiE. Jack Liu also  created fake virus samples to be identified
by KAV. Some unknown  person added Windows  headers to DOS  viruses to fool
F-Prot.

   A false positive is a file that was not created on purpose by anyone but
that is detected by antivirus when it's not a virus. KAV for example, scans
VBA source code files as the virus. Some time ago a game coded by GriYo was
being scanned as a trojan when it was not.

   Other category of fake could be those virus samples modified to get them
not working. Example: Adding INT 20h as first instruction of a COM sample.

   We can not  consider as fakes  corrupted or  damaged viruses done by the
virus coder. Also are not fakes dropped files by a virus, as INI or BAT.

   Why is  not a good idea to  include fakes in VS2000 or any other program
DAT files?

   Because if they are included when you check other collector log file, if
you miss  from him  a virus that  you have  as fake, the  program  will not
request it.

   So I suggest you remove fakes  from DAT  files to avoid  not  requesting
good samples you have as fakes.

   If you are afraid of requesting same fakes you have from other collector
because they are not in the DAT file so you miss them I suggest you discard
requests by CRC32. You only have to add the CRC32s of fakes to CRC32.DAT.
