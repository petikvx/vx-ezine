                             by VirusBuster
               -----------------------------------------------


   Before explaining the "how" I would like to explain the "why".

   There are  several reasons to explain why someone would like to obtain a
list with the viruses he misses from AVP aka KAV. One could be in  order to
make a "most wanted" list or a request of missed stuff. Other reason can be
that someone could make a search in Google or similars looking for the worm
or virus or whatever he misses and find it. Per example you notice you miss
"Backdoor.Iroffer.1209", so you go to Google and  look for "iroffer". First
result is "iroffer - home" which is the site of the  backdoor so you get it
without much effort.

   Now  that you know  why is so  interesting to have a list with the stuff
missed from AVP we are going to see how to obtain it.

   First I will explain three methods to obtain the list containing all the
viruses detected by AVP and finally I will comment how to use it to  obtain
the list of missed stuff.


   First method: AVLIST

   "Virus name lister 1.5 for AntiVirus Software.
   This is a Shareware by Jack liu.    (/? help)
   Support: AVP, F-Prot, Dr.Solomon, NAI Scan 4.x

   Usage: AVLIST path
     path     AntiVirus software path

   default path
     AVP          ..\AV\AVP\
     DR.Solomon   ..\AV\DR\
     F-Prot       ..\AV\FP\
     Scan 4.x     ..\AV\NAI\
   for F-Prot
     Please do: F-PROT /VIRLIST>F-PROT.LST"

   AVLIST  is a  tool  coded  by Jack liu with just one purpose: generate a
list with the missed stuff from AVP, F-Prot, Dr. Solomon and NAI Scan 4.x.

   The tool is  really simple to use and you only have to tell AVLIST where
is the path containing AVP databases. After that you will get a  log having
all detected stuff by AVP.


   Second method: AVP eXtender aka AVPX

   "AVPX  AVP eXtender  release 3.29  (c) 1998-2001 Z0MBiE  http://z0mbie.cjb.net

   syntax:
     AVPX [option[-] ...] [!keyword ...] filemask[.AVC] [outpath[\]]

   options:
     /no    ...do not create obj files (both 16 and 32-bit) -- works faster
     /no16  ...do not create only 16-bit obj files
     /no32  ...do not create only 32-bit obj files
     /l     ...keep obj libs (.l16/.l32) files -- do not erase 'em on exit
     /k     ...keep lnkNNNN.dat files
     /names ...extract ONLY virii names
     /a     ...append to _names instead of overwriting file
     /q     ...be quiet (but show warnings/errors)
     /qq    ...be quiet (show nothing)
     /nh    ...no headers/info
     /ns    ...no stamms/info
     /p     ...pause on error/warning messages
     /ren   ...automatically rename .OBJ files
 
   examples:
     AVPX c:\avp\* d:\sux /names /a  ...append all known virnames to d:\sux\_names
     AVPX . ...will extract all AVCs in the current directory"

   AVPX is a tool coded by 29A member named Z0MBiE and it is multipurpose.

   We do not need to know all its uses, just the commands  necessary to get
the list of all viruses detected by AVP. For this we follow next steps:

   1) We create a directory and copy *.AVC there.

   2) We go to directory having *.AVC and execute AVPX using next commands:

      AVPX . . /names /a

   3) We execute VS2000 console with next command line:

      VS2000 -DA _NAMES C:\TEST\TEST.EXE~9infected:~20

   4) We rename _NAMES to AVP.LOG

   AVP.LOG will be the log with complete list of viruses detected by AVP.


   Third method: AVPVLIST

   AVPVLIST is a tool installed along with KAV 4.5 and it is used to make a
list of all viruses detected by the antivirus.

   The usage of the tool is really simple. The user must  indicate the path
where the log must be stored and then press "Generate".

   After this you must modify the generated file in order to  convert it to
a valid AVP log file. I use EDIT.COM for this for example.

   Valid AVP log format is: path + tabulator + infected: + space + virus ID

   Example: C:\TEST\TEST.COM#9infected: Jerusalem.1808.A


   Final step: Using the log with all detected stuff by AVP.

   You just have to compare the log you got with your AVP database.

   Example using VS2000 console:

   VS2000 -C AVP.LOG

   And that is all. You will get NEWAVP.LOG with all the stuff you miss.
