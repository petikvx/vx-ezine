                           ------------------


   Virus magazines oriented to virus coders have been really popular in the
history of the vx scene, but really few stuff for virus collectors has been
released since scene exists.

   Most of the articles and stuff in any other shape oriented to collectors
have been released individually and there have been a few attempts of doing
a magazine for virus collecting community. It was many years ago, around 99
when Virus Trading Center group formed by VirusBuster, Shadow Seeker, Tally
and Slage Hammer gathered several articles and put all them together inside
"Virus Trading Center (VTC) Newsletter". This  attempt of  doing a magazine
for collectors was not successful and it did not have a continuation.  More
recently  some people from  virustrading.com gathered  several articles and
other stuff like programs and  also viral  stuff into a magazine, but their
work did not see the light and  remained unreleased, not to  mention it was
not a fully focused virus collecting magazine.

  Resuming... in over 10 years of vx scene there has not been a serious try
to make a magazine for collectors and I thought it was time to finish that.

  The magazine pretends to be an open  channel for all  virus collectors or
anyone that can contribute in anyway. Contributions will be reviewed by the
editor (that is me,  VirusBuster) and  they  will  be accepted  or rejected
depending if the stuff is interesting, new and accurate. Even members  from
antivirus industry and security field can participate if they want.

  It is well known the "discrepancies" between several members of the virus
collecting community and me but this magazine pretends to be a neutral zone
where everybody have voice, so nobody will be rejected by his nick.

  I animate all collectors to participate in this project so it will not be
a "one man" work. Collectors also can request articles for specified themes
that can be discussed and explained in future magazines.

  Not much more to say here... just hands on work!

                                                                VirusBuster
