                                by VirusBuster
                            ---------------------


- How old are you? Where do you come from?

I am over 20 years old and from Europe.

- Why did you start collecting viruses?

I had some viruses on a CD, I got infected and I was interested to have more
of them, because they had an "underground touch" - I liked to have something
"prohibited/dangerous" to collect. So, I started to collect viruses instead
of stamps and other things.

- For how long have you been collecting viruses?

About 6 years.

- Did you ever stop trading viruses and continued after a time? If yes,
  for how long were you inactive?, why did you stop?, why did you decide
  to continue?

Yes, I stopped trading viruses when I was fooled by some trader. I think I
was inactive for 1 year or so; dunno anymore exactly. But I still continued
to collect viruses when I had time. I decided to continue when I had some
more time and when I saw that there where enough new small traders with new
stuff for me, in order that I would again be one of the big traders in a
short period of time. Butt his time I was a bit smarter and tried to avoid to
get fooled again. Also I stopped to provide weekly collections of viruses for
free download of other traders etc. I am again retired, this time because I
have not enough time for that. Maybe in some years I will trade again, maybe
I will never trade again like I did in past.

- What are your virus statistics actually? (AVP/F-Prot/... unique/total)

I do not tell actual statistics, as I am retired since over a half year. I
guess that it was around 40.000 AVP uniques and around 100.000 in total.

- What antivirus do you usually use for making logs? Do you use any other
  antivirus from time to time? If yes, what are them?

I used AVP, F-Prot and McAfee.

- Do the people near you (parents, friends, ...) know you collect viruses?

Yes, they know.

- Do you consider necessary to avoid telling people you collect viruses? If
  yes, why?

Depends. Some people are quite stupid, and if they would hear about it, they
would spread around that I am a terrorist just because I collect them. Other
peoples that knows me better and are more intelligent knows that what I do
is harmless, so it is not necessary that I avoid it to them.

- Do you avoid trading with any collector? If yes, who and what are the
  reasons?

No, but there were traders with who I prefered to trade, because I know them
since long time and because they have good reputation (always fair trades,
good samples, etc.).

- Is there any virus collector that you admire for any reason? If yes, who
  and what are the reasons to admire him?

I admire VirusBuster, because he is the "King" of the vX scene and he helps
other traders providing tools, links and news related to VX.

- Did you ever work for an antivirus company?

No comment...

- Did you ever trade with an antivirus company or an antivirus researcher?

No comment...

- Do you keep stuff that you can not/do not want to trade?

No comment...

- Did you ever exchange your complete virus collection with other collector?

No comment...

- In your opinion, what is the best and what is the worst antivirus scanner? Why?

The best scanner is in my opinion KAV, because they are usually the first in
providing new AV techniques, they have a high detection ratio and they use
various names for each variant and easy-read names for naming viruses.

The worst antivirus scanner is in my opinion Sophos, because they do not
have automatic updates, not very high detection rates and no good heuristic.

- What is the program you use to process logs?

VS2000GUI of VirusBuster.

- What is the program you use to rename files?

VS2000GUI of VirusBuster.

- What is the program you use to sort your collection?

VS2000GUI of VirusBuster and sometimes if VS2000GUI is currently working I
use CollectionMaker.

- Do you check for fake viruses? If yes, what is the program you use for
  doing that?

VS2000GUI of VirusBuster or various antiviruses as pre-check. I also use some
other "secret" tools ;-)

- Do you use any additional program for doing any virus collecting task? If
  yes, what are those programs and what they do?

All I need is already contained into VS2000GUI of VirusBuster. Some other
tools I use does check for fakes/garbage or deleting empty directories (what
also VS2000GUI can do).

- How is your collection sorted and stored? Do you keep viruses compressed or
  uncompressed? What is the directory structure?

My collection is stored on Hard Disk. Old samples are compressed in ZIP files,
the new samples are uncompressed (in order to delete the dupes before
compressing them). Samples are stored by AVP names (VS2000GUI ->
CollectionMakerStyle).

- Do you make backups of your collection? If yes, How often and what is the
  media you use to make backups?

Yes, I did in past backups every year (that is not often enough, as I had to
discover many times :-/ ), on CDs or on a second Hard Disk.

- Did you used to use VS2000 package tools before it became viriiware? If
  yes, what is your opinion about the change from freeware to viriiware?,
  Did you continue using VS2000 package tools after the change?

Yes, I used it also before. The change is a good idea; nowadays there is
nothing you can get for free i fit is good - if you want quality, you have to
give something away. Yes, I continued to use the tools after the change.

- What is your opinion about the viriiware?

Good idea. I was a bit hard to understand at the beginning of the change,
but after a while I understood that it was a good decision taken by the
author.

- Your greetings, if any, go here:

I want to greet all VXers, especially  (in alphabetical order):
m0n30, PanoiX, Perikles, SPTH, TRNEY, VirusBuster, VirusP and all the others
who traded with me during the last years.
