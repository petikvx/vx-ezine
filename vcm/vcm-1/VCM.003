   How many times above lines have scrolled in virus collectors monitors?

   At least on mine hundreds of times, probably thousands.

   AVPDOS32 3.0 build 133 was  for many years, along  with F-Prot, the most
popular antivirus used for virus trading.

   Many years ago Dr. Solomon and F-Prot used to be the most popular avs to
exchange viruses. After a time Dr. Solomon started to remove unique IDs and
add more and more generic detections, so it was time for a change. That  is
why AVP became so popular among collectors: AVP was able to  detect a large
list of viruses in a unique way, without generic detections.

   AVPDOS32 became after a time the most used  antivirus between collectors
while F-Prot started to lose popularity and this has been that way for many
time. AVPDOS32 the unquestionable king of log files.

   AVPDOS32 have had its pros and contras. I would point as pros:

   + With the time became freeware.

   + Antivirus databases updates are for free.

   + All virus collectors used to use it to make logs.

   + Frequent updates: weekly and daily updates.

   and as contras:

   + Support was discontinued.

   + "Midnight" bug which produces I/O errors while  scanning certain files
     if scanning is done between 00:00 and 00:59 AM.

   + Slow scanning speed.

   + Depending of the command line you get different scanning results.

   + No automatic updating.


   After january 2004 cumulative the situation has changed: if AVP was slow
now its terribly slow. Per example my collection used to need 3 hours to be
scanned with AVPDOS32 and actually it needs over 11 hours. That is too much
for anyone.

   So I consider that is time for a change but not of antivirus as occurred
with Dr. Solomon, just of version.

   Some  collectors are  actually using  KAVDOS32 3.0 build 135 or KAVDOS32
4.0 to make logs. They switched from AVPDOS32 3.0 build 133 to any of these
versions. Why? I really do not know because those versions are still really
slow compared to KAV 4.5.

   Kaspersky  Antivirus 4.5 is  the solution  to speed  problems. It  needs
around 48 minutes to scan  my collection. That is a third  part of the time 
that AVPDOS32 used to need when it was working fine.

   What are the main problems someone could find if he decides to change of
antivirus version? (AVPDOS32/KAVDOS32 -> KAV 4.5)

   First, the tools he uses must be adapted to use KAV logs. The  most used
set of virus  trading tools  is VS2000 package which is already prepared to
manage KAV logs. So I recommend to use VS2000 package tools.

   Second, he must know how to configure and use KAV.

   Configuration of KAV:

   1) Run AVP32.EXE

   2) Click "Expert" button from left menu.

   3) Click "Options" button from left menu.

   4) In "Options" you select:

      Save report file -> Enabled

      Define where to store the log and with what name

      Show pack info, Show clean object, Append and Limit size -> Disabled

   5) Select your preferences from "Customize" menu from left menu.

   6) Go to "File" menu and select "Save Profile as Default".

   Using KAV:

   KAV can be used from command line or from the GUI.

   From command line the user must use:

   AVP32 /S /W /Q C:\DIRECTORY_TO_SCAN

   or:

   AVP32 /S /W /Q /redundant C:\DIRECTORY_TO_SCAN

   to use redundant scanning.

   From GUI the user must select what directory to scan.

   It is not possible to use redundant scanning from GUI.

   From command line is not possible to define where the log will be saved.

   If you want to run KAV from a batch file you must use "START /W".

   Example:

   C:
   CD \ANTIVIRUS\KAV
   START /W AVP32.EXE /S /W /Q C:\VIRUS
   CD \ANTIVIRUS\F-PROT
   F-PROT /DUMB /ARCHIVE /PACKED /NOMEM /COLLECT /REPORT=F-PROT.LOG C:\VIRUS
   ...

   If you do not use "START /W" the batch file will continue running lines.

   Third, and finishing problems issue, different identifications question.

   There is also other problem common to all AVP/KAV versions. Depending of
the version and command line you use AVP will identify a  virus with a name
or other or it will not identify it at all.

   That explains why even using same databases you can miss stuff from logs
of other collectors but when you get that stuff it does not scan as new.

   In order to know exactly all the stuff AVPDOS32/KAVDOS32/KAV are able to
detect in a collection would be necessary to make at least 6 logs:

   1) AVPDOS32 3.0 build 133 without redundant scanning:

   AVPDOS32 /S /Y /* /M /B /P /H /W=AVP.LOG C:\PATH

   2) AVPDOS32 3.0 build 133 with redundant scanning:

   AVPDOS32 /S /Y /* /M /B /P /H /V /U /W=AVP.LOG C:\PATH

   3) KAVDOS32 4.0 without redundant scanning:

   KAVDOS32 /S /Y /* /M /B /P /H /W=AVP.LOG C:\PATH

   4) KAVDOS32 4.0 with redundant scanning:

   KAVDOS32 /S /Y /* /M /B /P /H /V /U /W=AVP.LOG C:\PATH

   5) KAV 4.5 without redundant scanning:

   AVP32.EXE /S /W /Q C:\PATH

   6) KAV 4.5 with redundant scanning:

   AVP32.EXE /S /W /Q /redundant C:\PATH

   Obviously making 6 logs every  week is a crazyness, so my suggestion is:
when a  new cumulative  update is out  you make a log  with KAV 4.5 without
redundant scanning then you make the other 5 logs and you create a log with
all the stuff missed by KAV 4.5 log so until next cumulative is out you add
manually the missed viruses adding them apart:

   VS2000 -B AVP.LOG -A MISSED.LOG

   That way  you will not miss  viruses that only are detected by different
versions of AVP.

   Here you can see the pros and the contras from KAV in my opinion:

   Pros:

   + Technical support is available.

   + Antivirus databases updates are for free.

   + It becomes to be the standard log to use in trades.

   + Frequent updates: weekly and daily updates.

   + Fast scanning.

   + Automatic updates.

   Contras:

   + It is not freeware.

   + Depending of the command line you get different scanning results.

   + It is not possible to define where to store the log in real time.


   As you can see it has more pros than contras compared to AVPDOS/KAVDOS32
so it is time to make it the standard... the unquestionable king of trades.

   Updating KAV bases is a child game. You just need to run AVPUPD.EXE.

   If you  plan to use  AVPDOS32 and/or  KAVDOS32 there  is an easy  way to
update all versions  at a time.

   Imagine  you  have  KAV  at  C:\ANTIVIR\KAV,  AVPDOS32 3.0  build 133 at
C:\ANTIVIR\AVPDOS32 and KAVDOS32 4.0 at  C:\ANTIVIR\KAVDOS32. If  you  have
one directory with bases for each  version means  you must have 3 times the
same files and update 3 times the 3 antivirus versions.

   This is not necessary at all. You can  have KAV 4.5  databases installed
and  modify  AVPDOS32/KAVDOS32 AVPDOS32.INI in  order to  point  "BasePath"
section to where KAV 4.5 bases are installed.

   Example of AVPDOS32.INI:

   [AVP32]
   DefaultProfile=
   LocFile=AVP_LOCe.DLk
  
   [Configuration]
   KeyFile=AVP.KEY
   KeysPath=.
   SetFile=AVP.SET
   BasePath=C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\KAVSHA~1\BASES

   So when you run AVPUPD KAV 4.5 bases get updated but also DOS32 versions
are updated too.

   KAV also  has other advantage  and it is the easy retrieving  of X-Files
databases. You only have to launch the Updater and check "Change settings",
then  open "Update AVP from Internet" tree,  click in the "..." button, and
add an URL like this one: "ftp://ftp.kaspersky.com/updates_x/" finally just
move the URL you just added to the first place of the list  clicking in the
up arrow.

   For all the above reasons I suggest you switch to KAV 4.5 to make logs.
