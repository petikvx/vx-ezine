                            ----------------------


- How old are you? Where do you come from?

36, Italy

- Why did you start collecting viruses?

Hate and love. When i got my first infection i fall in panic. Then, using my
first antivirus, i discovered vx could be easily managed, so i saved a sample
copy onto a floppy disk. On facts i started my collection.

- For how long have you been collecting viruses?

About 13 years, since 1991.

- Did you ever stop trading viruses and continued after a time? If yes, for
  how long were you inactive?, why did you stop?, why did you decide to
  continue?

Never stopped since i known internet traders. They helped with tips and
tricks to improve my collection, i found also kind people. I don't know if
i'll stop my collection in the future, i'm very busy with my work... and
other hobbies ;-) but i'm still fascinating about vx world.

- What are your virus statistics actually? (AVP/F-Prot/... unique/total)

For AVP:
43695 total
42527 unique
For F-Prot:
39027 total
36417 unique

- What antivirus do you usually use for making logs? Do you use any other
  antivirus from time to time? If yes, what are them?

Actually i use AVP 4.5 for Windows and F-Prot for DOS, i'm thinking for RAV
in a next future.

- Do the people near you (parents, friends, ...) know you collect viruses?

Yes, they know... but i'm not sure they understand exactly what it be.

- Do you consider necessary to avoid telling people you collect viruses? If
  yes, why?

Yes, for two personal reason: first, cause my work. I'm a businessman, you
know many people have bad opinion about vx... second, i don't like to talk
about my affairs to other people: they aren't interested for sure about this
matter.

- Do you avoid trading with any collector? If yes, who and what are the
  reasons?

Usually i set trades with known and tested people. For unknown traders i ask
first, to avoid frauds.

- Is there any virus collector that you admire for any reason? If yes, who
  and what are the reasons to admire him?

Three ppl: Virusbuster, ViruP and Trney for their kind, help, tips and skill.

- Did you ever work for an antivirus company?

I didn't

- Did you ever trade with an antivirus company or an antivirus researcher?

I think no

- Do you keep stuff that you can not/do not want to trade?

I share all my stuff for all traders.

- Did you ever exchange your complete virus collection with other collector?

No, i don't exchange my whole collection, sorry.

- In your opinion, what is the best and what is the worst antivirus scanner?
  Why?

I think VirusP's avx test is a good way to value that. However Kaspersky
(AVP/KAV) seems one of the best.

- What is the program you use to process logs?

To process log i use VS2000 tool.

- What is the program you use to rename files?

To rename file i use RENFILES for CRC32; RENEXTS and EXTSCAN for right
extension.

- What is the program you use to sort your collection?

To sort my collection i use VS2000 tool.

- Do you check for fake viruses? If yes, what is the program you use for
  doing that?

I check fake virus, dupes and other craps using FAKESCAN and VIRWEED.

- Do you use any additional program for doing any virus collecting task? If
  yes, what are those programs and what they do?

I use FSCAN to recognize samples marked as parts, corrupted and fakes.

- How is your collection sorted and stored? Do you keep viruses compressed or
  uncompressed? What is the directory structure?

My collection is sorted as Bulk Style and i use a dedicated PC to manage my
collection. My collection is uncompressed (but few files: for their nature
they must stay compressed), i rename all files with their CRC32 because is
useful to avoid dupes.

- Do you make backups of your collection? If yes, How often and what is the
  media you use to make backups?

Sure, i make backups of my collection. I do that every 2-3 months on CD
media. Then i format my HD (for safety reason you know).

- Did you used to use VS2000 package tools before it became viriiware? If
  yes, what is your opinion about the change from freeware to viriiware?,
  Did you continue using VS2000 package tools after the change?

I used the public version of VS2000 and this is the reason i still use the
viriiware version of VS2000. VS2000 is a complete tool, but i think new
traders can be involved to use other FREE vx manager. Technical aspects of
program are costantly improved, very good.

- What is your opinion about the viriiware?

Did you know? I love porno sites instead VS2000, but i must pay money to
access there :-p

In other words: viriiware is better than pay. It's the right price for his
developer.
