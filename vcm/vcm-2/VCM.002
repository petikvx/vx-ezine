   Depending on how you have named your file names you can lose some trade.
Also the paths  to store files are  important. This  is due you  give clues
about where you got the  file or the name of the file, which can be used to
look for it at Google.


   2 examples of bad file naming follow:

   H:\NEW\HEIBAI04\0BDD0831.zip/SDBOTEdit.exe Infected Backdoor.Tongbot.102 <cd0000.0.e>

   H:\viru\HEI\mmfriend1.0.zip/mmfriend.exe Infected TrojanDownloader.Win32.Friendown <cd0000.0.e>


   In the first case we notice the file  was probably downloaded from a web
site called "Heibai" due the path where the files is stored.

   In the second case we notice the probable file name to look for it.

   That is why it is smart to rename file names to their CRC32, which it is
also useful for other questions.
