   Traditionally AVP (KAV) and F-Prot  have been the  two more  popular avs
used to make logs and exchange with them.

   F-Prot popularity has decreased due the problems in the engine (crashes,
different detections depending of the  extension of the file, etc) and also
because the amount of unique detections was not increased as AVP did.

   That is why nowadays AVP is the only antivirus used  to exchange by many
virus collectors, but  since some  time ago some  collectors started to use
other antivirus to exchange: McAfee, RAV, PC-Cillin, Nod, Dr.Web, ...

   A good  question is: Is worth to  make and exchange  using those logs or
would be better to use other antivirus?

   This article will try to reply this question.

   There are two important points in order to  decide if it is worth to use
an antivirus to exchange or not: amount of unique detections in first place
and speed in second.

   If an antivirus has a low  number of unique detections will not be worth
to use it. Why? Because many different viruses and malware will be detected
with the same names, something not interesting for us, or even worst, it is
not detected at all.

   If an antivirus is slow, you probably only will want to run it from time
to time, not weekly.

   So taking in account these two premises I will rate most popular avs:


   Avast:

   Bad in unique detections: less than 30,000.

   Bad speed: over 1 hour and 30 minutes to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Not recommended to be used to exchange.


   AVG:

   Bad in unique detections: less than 25,000.

   Normal speed: Around 50 minutes to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Not recommended to be used to exchange.


   BitDefender:

   Excellent in unique detections: over 60,000.

   Bad speed: over 2 hours to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Recommended to be used from time to time to exchange.


   Dr. Web:

   Normal in unique detections: Around 30,000.

   Normal speed: Around 45 minutes to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Not recommended to be used to exchange.


   eTrust EZ Antivirus (Vet/Innoculate):

   Bad in unique detections: Less than 25,000.

   Normal speed: Around 40 minutes to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Not recommended to be used to exchange.


   Ikarus:

   Bad in unique detections: Around 25,000.

   Ugly speed: Over 4 hours to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Not recommended to be used to exchange.


   KAV:

   Excellent in unique detections: over 55,000.

   Bad speed: over 1 hour and 15 minutes to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Recommended to be used to exchange.


   McAfee:

   Normal in unique detections: Around 30,000.

   Bad speed: Around 1 hour and 20 minutes to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Not recommended to be used to exchange.


   Nod32:

   Good in unique detections: Over 40,000.

   Excellent speed: 18 minutes to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Highly recommended to be used to exchange.


   RAV:

   Excellent in unique detections: over 60,000.

   Good speed: Around 30 minutes to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Highly recommended to be used to exchange.


   Sweep (Sophos):

   Good in unique detections: Over 40,000.

   Bad speed: Around 1 hour and 11 minutes to scan 120,000 files.

   Evaluation: Recommended to be used from time to time to exchange.


   Final words:

   Considering results I recommend KAV, RAV and Nod32 as the best antivirus
to be used to exchange, and BitDefender and Sweep to  be used from  time to
time.
