   The way to rename file names in your collection is an important question
you must not understate.

   In the past one of the most popular ways to rename files was to give the
file the name that the antivirus (F-Prot or AVP) gives to the virus.

   For example, if AVP was detecting "Jerusalem.1808.a" the file name was:

   C:\VIRUS\AVP\Jerusalem.1808.a.COM

   Virus sorting tools as Collection Maker, done by Igi, used this style to
store files in collection.

   This sorting method was fine for a while, until VirusBuster (that is me)
had a really interesting idea.

   *History mode-on*

   One of the problems trading is that collectors may use different DEFs to
trade, which means some  samples could be  traded unnecesarily. In the past
collectors  used to  exchange TbWeeder (famouse file weeder util) databases
previous to exchange, in order to remove duplicated files from the request.
This tradition of sending TbWeeder  databases got lost  and no other method
replaced it.

   *History mode-off* :-)

   The idea I had was that log files could act like  TbWeeder databases, so
duplicated files could be removed from requests automatically. For  this is
required that files have as name their CRC32.

   Other  advantage of  renaming  files to  their  CRC32 is  that meanwhile

   "C:\VIRUS\AVP\Jerusalem.1808.a.COM" are 33 characters

   "C:\VIRUS\AVP\12345678.COM" are 25 characters which means log files will
be smaller.

   Nowadays DSL or even faster connections are well spreaded but some years
ago modems ruled internet and connections were  expensive, so reducing logs
size was not a joke.

   Other advantage of renaming files to their CRC32 is explained in VCM.002
: you may lose trades having files renamed in other ways.

   For all these reasons I suggest that if you are not still using CRC32 to
rename files in your collection you switch as soon as possible.

   An easy way to convert your collection to CRC32 naming is using tools as
Bulk, done by Poltergst, or "Bulk style" from VS2000 GUI, done by me.
