        Windows(C)(TM)(R)(ETC...)  is something which seems to be making most
 of  the  people  feel  nausea.  Why? I will try to explain this using my own
 feelings towards the thing.

        I  remember 1990, when I was in the 11th grade in high-school. It was
 then  when  the  first  286s  were  penetrating  the  romanian market and my
 high-school was priviledged to have some. I remember playing nice  games for
 those  times  like  Barbarian  and  Sokoban. Also I recall my first lines in
 Turbo  Pascal  5.0 and QuickBasic. Our main tool was Norton Commander and we
 didn't need anything else.

        Then, one friend came with a few floppy disks and said to us: "Hey, I
 have  this cool thing... Windows it's called. It's supposed to give you many
 facilities  and  stuff..."  We  said,  deh,  hell!, let's try it out. It was
 version 3.0.

        And  we  installed  the darn thing... At first sight it looked pretty
 ok,  but,  then  again,  pretty  useless... A bunch of application we didn't
 need. A clock, a calendar, a notebook... All looking the same. Of course, it
 caught  our  eyes.  All  those  colored  icons, the animated stuff... But we
 didn't stop there...

        I wrote a small tsr which was supposed to move the screen up and down
 two minutes after its launch. I started it under DOS and then enter Windows.
 After  two  minutes the whole Windows' screen started to shake. I understood
 then that Windows was nothing more than an alternative to a disk/application
 browser coming as an application over the operating system.

        Nobody  back  then didn't even think about the mighty plans Microsoft
 had  of overcoming the entire software industry... It came a few years later
 with  the  international  launch  on  the  market  for Windows 95. Man, what
 publicity...  what  drums  beaten  for nothing more than a bunch of animated
 stuff  having no other use than to do exactly what was doable before, but in
 a  more  "nice" environment. The mouse became the most important tool... But
 more  important  than  that,  for  the first time Windows tried to become an
 operating system.

        The  try  failed  miserably.  Even if Windows 95 tried to look like a
 pathetic  try to imitate the Macintosh desktop it was more than obvious that
 still  Windows  95  is  a  "something"  sticking on the back of the good old
 Ms-Dos.  I  will not enter the technical details here, but check for example
 Gryio's article from 29A#3 about VxD calls.

        Let's  not  even  mention  the  fact that Windows 95 probably had the
 biggest number of beta releases than any other product.

        Due  to  the  huge  ammount  of  bugs and the continous strange hangs
 experienced by Windows 95, Microsoft released the Windows 95 OSR2, also know
 by some people as Windows 96. Some bugs were fixed, other appeared.

        Two  years  later  and  after another serie of buggy betas, Microsoft
 released  what  they said to be the last version of Windows based on Windows
 95, named Windows 98.

        It's  true,  Windows  98 has less problems than it's parents, but the
 concept  of  HTML  desktop  makes it worse than them. The HTML desktop looks
 exactly  like  the  playground of some stupid children playing in sand... Of
 course, this is merely my humble opinion.

        A  complete other way got the other OS from Microsoft, called Windows
 NT.  Well,  this  is  more  like  what Windows was  thought to be. Much more
 reliable,  less  hangs, more security and more speed. It's big disadvantage:
 the high price. This is not an OS to have home but at the company.

        However,  in  1999-2000  Microsoft planed to join the two products in
 what  will  soon appear as Windows 2000. Even if the market is full of betas
 of  this  product,  I  was not curious yet to get it and check it. From what
 other people said, it looks like a Windows NT with a Windows 98 layout.

        The  question we all are asking: where is it gonna reach and how will
 this way affect the virus authoring.

        In my opinion, the Windows 2000 will soon become the most used OS all
 around.  The  win32  viral technique will face a big challenge then. Most of
 the  win32  viruses  work  only  under  Win95/98  because  of  their leak of
 security.  Windows  2000  will  be harder to overcome, but not impossible. I
 also  think that probably in a few years, Microsoft will drop completely the
 16 bit applications under Windows and will move to only 32 bit. Also, I have
 a  feeling that soon we shall see a new modification in the PE format, maybe
 even  a new name. I think soon Microsoft will loose completely the NE format
 and the PE format will remain for the new format as NE was for PE.

        What is most important for the virus author is too always be in touch
 with  the  latest  news  on the OS. For this one must visit pretty often the
 Microsoft site and download any new DDK or SDK uploaded.

        Basically  I  think  that in the following two years the most obvious
 enhancements  for  Windows  will be first of all graphical and second of all
 based   on  Internet.  Mostly  e-mail clients will appear with more and more
 security,  to avoid Internet worms. The browsers will go who knows were. But
 the  virus writer should stay calm... Microsoft Corporation will continue to
 give  us  working  material  in  the  future as it did in the past. The more
 complicated  the  OS  gets,  the  most  holes  will it have to use. The more
 advanced  the  low level programming gets, the more difficult will it be for
 viruses to be stoped.

        Already  the  anti-virus  industry is far beyond the virus scene. The
 AVs  cannot  hold against the win32 attack. It's maybe the peak of the virus
 activity,  and  all  resides  in  the  lameness  of  the  Windows  design. I
 understand  making a "nice looking" OS, but not by loosing all the security.
 Unfortunately  for the AV people, they cannot rely on using the undocumented
 ways  because  their  programs  *must*  be  trusted,  while  the viruses may
 basically use anything that comes in handy... And its much, so much...

        So,  as a platform for the Win32 System, the Microsoft Windows is and
 will still be a perfect place to unleash viruses. Hail, people!!
