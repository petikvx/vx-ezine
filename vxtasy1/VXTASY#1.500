        This  is  an  interview  with one of the best win32 coders out there,
 Jacky Qwerty. Good luck at University, man!!


 >>>>>> Q.  It is not everyday that people decide to go into VX writing. What
 made you go on this path?

        I've  been  in  contact with computers all my life, partly because my
 family  had  been running a computer store for years. So my first steps into
 the computer world went almost naturally. But it wasn't until I had my first
 contact  with a computer virus that I became completely curious, excited and
 crazy  about  them.  It  was  named "Tabulero", the very first file infector
 written in my former country Venezuela. Shortly after, there appeared others
 as  well  like Quiver and the infamous Dir2.Byway. But I was too y oung then
 and the "show" wouldn't really start for me until some years later ;-).

 >>>>>> Q. When and how did you appear in the VX scene?

        My first appearance in the VX scene occured shortly after the Concept
 virus was big news. At that time I had already gotten some average knowledge
 in  programming  languages  like  Qbasic,  Pascal and C/C++, but my assembly
 skills  were not that good. So in a hurry I decided to take my chance in the
 macro  stuff  world  which seemed a very promising choice at that time. So I
 downloaded  everything I could find on the subject, and a few weeks later, I
 started  to  write my own macro virus, WM.CAP, which I coded duri ng a whole
 restless  weekend  in December 1996. Shortly after, I met 29A, became one of
 its members, and the rest you know it well ;-).

 >>>>>> Q. How did you choose your nickname? Did you use other nicks before?

        Well  I  came  up  with  my  nick in a quite unusual but funny way. I
 remember  I  made a short list borrowing them from game packs, cartoons from
 TV,  etc, but it didn't help much ;). One day, after one of my biggest yawns
 ever  in  front  of  my  blurred  screen, my sleepy eyes quietly stood still
 looking at the keyboard, and read the first words that had always been there
 without  noticing:  "QWERTY".  It  didn't  sound that bad, I thought, but it
 lacked  something  else,  so I simply added "Jacky", since my real first nam
 e  begins  in  "J",  and  it finally became "Jacky Qwerty", or "jqwerty" for
 short. I have never used other nicks in the past, though.

 >>>>>> Q. Which are the main programming languages you use?

        My  favorite  languages  are  C/C++ and ASM since I can have a lot of
 control  over  a  known  environment  with them, and I like that! However, I
 program  some  other  high  level languages like Pascal, QBasic, Delphi, and
 also  M$ visual shitty stuff like VBasic, VC ++, etc. Recently however, I've
 been  experimenting  with  JAVA  and  Perl  for internet based applications.
 But  when  it comes to interact directly with the computer, I code much more
 fluently  and  faster in C/C++ than in any other language including ASM. For
 optimal speed and size though, ASM is the way to go. That's why most viruses
 are  written  in  this  languag  e.  Not  even  the best High-Level Language
 optimizer can ever circumvent this ;-).

 >>>>>> Q.  Where  do you live and how is the situation of the virus scene in
 your land ?

        I  currently live in Peru since almost two years ago. My family and I
 had  to  run away from Venezuela due to problems with justice - in short, we
 used  to  sell  pirated  software,  they caught us and took away most of our
 HW/SW  equipment.  Regarding the virus s ituation in my former country, what
 can  I  say, it really sucked. There seemed to be nobody there interested in
 viruses besides me, or at least that's what I thought at first.

        However  it  wasn't  until  WM.CAP  was  big  news  that I knew I was
 somewhat wrong. I started to receive emails from many virus writers all over
 the  world, including Venezuela - a big surprise for me indeed. None of them
 apparently  knew  about  each  other's exis tence - a thing not so common in
 Venezuela, and a sketch from the political situation there as well. Where TF
 had this people been all this time !? I keep wondering ;-).

        In  Peru however, the scene is a lot more active. There are plenty of
 youngsters interested in different H/P/C/V topics, including of course virus
 programming. Some notorious virus writers and very good friends of mine like
 Darkside (now retired) and Kid Chaos/SLAM are from Peru.

 >>>>>> Q. Tell us something about your last projects, if any.

        Sure, I have some projects going on right now, but unfortunately (for
 some enthusiasts) none of them are virus related. Some days ago I officially
 resigned  from  29A  and  retired  from  virus  scene  as well. A well-known
 ex-virus  writer once told me that all of us eventually get tired, bored and
 exhausted  of  virus  programming,  so  we  finally  retire  looking for new
 interesting areas in which to explore and research. And once we do, he said,
 it's  very  unlikely  to  ever  write  a  single line of virus code again. I
 think  he can't be closer from the truth. That's exactly what happened to me
 indeed.

        No,  this  doesn't  mean I won't ever write a computer program again.
 Lately,  even  though  I  have  found  myself  greatly  interested  in other
 non-computer  related stuff, my computer related interests have also evolved
 and  now  comprise  other  cool  programming  top  ics  as  well,  some more
 profitable  -  like  JAVA  and  Perl  programming,  and  others posing quite
 different  opportunities  - like compression and cryptography, for instance.
 As to what future holds, well I don't know 100%. It would be really boresome
 if we knew it all, don't you think? ;-).

 >>>>>> Q.  You  are  a  member  of  a  VX  group. Other groups you've worked
 in/with? Are there particular goals you and your group want to achieve?

        I  have  never  belonged  to any other group besides 29A in the past.
 Before  29A,  I  was just a new independant virus writer, just born from the
 media  and  the  hype  created by the CAP virus, now in imminent extinction.
 Perhaps  a bit of luck had something to do with it being a widespread threat
 and  also  with  my  entrance  in  29A.  I  remember  I  sent  a quick email
 congratulating  the  whole  29A crew after their very first zine, and then I
 received  replies  back  mostly from Mrsandman and Tcp. We exchanged lots of
 ideas  ,  mine  having to do basically with my independant research on Win32
 (SEH,  per-process  residency,  memory-mapping,  last  section trick, etc.).
 Shortly  after  I  was invited by Mrsandman to join the 29A crew, I said why
 not, and so it was.

        Since the very beginning, 29A has had pretty much the same goals that
 most  other  groups have had in the past: Programming the most technical top
 advanced  viruses ever, writing the best technical VX-related articles ever,
 and  finally  spreading  out all thi s knowledge farther. And even though we
 have come closer and closer to this goal, there's still much road to go over
 of course.

        In  addition,  apart from these technical goals, one of the most full
 rewarding experiences I've had with 29A and with others from the virus scene
 as  well, is perhaps those everlasting friendships that some of us developed
 during email exchanges, IRC chats , phone calls and even personal encounters
 during VX meetings. After all, what's really left when each of us eventually
 retires?  Surely  not  this  or  that kickass ultra virus technique, or that
 super  metapoly engine, it's perhaps all the friends you made w hat you will
 remember most in the future. Because in spite of AVers opinions about VXers,
 there  are  people in the VX scene with very high human quality that deserve
 to be remembered as such.

 >>>>>> Q.  Do  you  think that win32 programming will decrease the number of
 virus authors out there? Will macro virii start to take over?

        No, it's actually the opposite (imho). Win32 low level programming is
 increasing, you can tell by the number of viruses and worms recently written
 specifically  for  the Win32 platform. Win32.Cabanas started the Win9x-WinNT
 compatible  virus sequel, but it was shortly followed by other Win32 viruses
 as  well. There are also new emerging web pages about Win32 ASM programming,
 so Win32 is imminently increasing, no doubt about it.

        As  to  whether it will outnumber Macro stuff or viceversa, that will
 be  the  issue for years to come. That will depend greatly on M$ troglodytes
 of course. However, independently of "virus" programming on either platform,
 I think the M$ macro development i n general, which is basically application
 dependant, is much more fragile and can be interrupted easier than its Win32
 counterpart, which has obviously stronger roots since it's OS dependant. And
 even  this  statement may be no longer true in the future as Micro$oft keeps
 adding  scripting  language and embedding macro functionality in their OS's.
 Whatever  stays,  virus writers will have plenty of platforms to choose from
 ;-).

 >>>>>> Q.  Would  you like to do something else with computers than viruses,
 like demos or hacking or anything like?

        Of  course,  I  had  that  in mind since the very beginning. Not only
 viruses  have  got  my  attention.  I have also found particular interest in
 other  H/P/C/V  and compression/cryptography topics. It comes naturally: You
 only  do  one  single  thing,  you  end  up  getti ng used to it and finally
 disliking  it. Virus writers shouldn't be virus writers only. They should be
 "programmers"  long  before being virus writers, in that strict order. There
 are slight and extreme exceptions to this rule of course.

        For  instance, lamers who come to ACV or IRC and say "I wanna write a
 virus  and fuck up a HD real bad..", are nothing but childish kids who never
 manage  to  write a single virus ever, they will always be wannabes, with no
 evident intention to research, evo lve or code something original throughout
 their  miserable  lives  -  tough but true. However it's also true that some
 virus writers never reach to be "true" programmers as well. And that happens
 if they dedicate solely to virus programming only.

 >>>>>> Q. Are there things or people you dislike within the VX ?

        Yes,  I  really  dislike  certain god-alike attitudes that some virus
 writers show towards other "human beings". For instance, when they manage to
 write  viruses  that  effectively  escape  into  the  wild. I have met virus
 writers  that  change  dramatically their be havior once this happens, as if
 saying  "Ok  I'm no longer a newbie, and you're no longer my master". I just
 laugh and say to myself "Gee he has the god-psyndrome" ;-).

        I   also  hate  selfish,  unfriendly,  arrogant  attitudes  sometimes
 evidenced  by persons, VX-related or not, I have never known or heard about,
 but  who  suddenly  drop  me  unexpected  emails  or appear on IRC with such
 childish offensive attitude. At first, I expla in my reasons to them, that I
 simply  do  it  for  fun,  etc. But after a while you get used to it, you no
 longer  give  explanations,  you simply ignore them - i.e. you kick/ban them
 ;-).

 >>>>>> Q.  What  makes  you  choose  the  names  of  your viruses? Give some
 examples...

        I  have  no  written  rule for that. Sometimes I name a virus after a
 good  friend  of mine, as in the Win32.Cabanas virus. Other times I choose a
 name  of  a  person  I dislike, as in the WM.CAP virus. And at other times I
 simply name a virus according to some fu nny story or anecdote that makes me
 laugh,  as in the DogPaw or Numbless virus, etc. At other times I don't even
 choose the name, AVers do, as in the Win95.Jacky virus ;-).

 >>>>>> Q.  Does  the  VX  have  an  influence  on your life/friends ? Has it
 changed ?

        I  have  tried  to  carry both virus programming and my personal life
 apart  from  each  other.  So far it has worked. Neither my relatives nor my
 closest  friends  would  ever suspect about me, a guy who in real life never
 talks  about  his  predilect  H/P/C/V  topics  to anybody except him and his
 computer.  Moreover,  I  obtained  my  bachelor's  degree  in  a  completely
 different  area  other  than  programming or computer science related stuff.
 Because  of  that,  my life didn't really change dramatically at the time my
 nickname began to irritate users and AVers out there ;-).

        I  just  took  everything  smoothly  and naturally as it happened. Of
 course,  I enjoyed a lot that secret virtual part of me, as much in the same
 way  as  in real life I still enjoy doing other sort of things normal people
 usually  do  -  go to the movies, chat in a cafe, going to parties, etc. But
 regarding virus related issues, hey I'd better keep that to myself. The dark
 side of me, if you prefer.

 >>>>>> Q.  What  are  your  favorite  stuffs in the VX field (virus, author,
 engine,   etc...)   Is   there   one   virus  you  like  most,  due  to  its
 originality/complexity?

        Some  viruses  come to mind: The "Byway" virus had a strong influence
 over  me.  I remember I disassembled it from top to bottom and learned a lot
 from  it. It was a imminent threat in my former country and it spread wildly
 like most Dir-2 viruses did during their lifetime. "Natas" was also quite an
 advanced  bug, with strong poly, full stealth, etc, but its author seemed to
 have  no  creativity at all for a good payload, same as "Hare" and all other
 destructive viruses.

        I also liked "OneHalf" very much, as it was an exception to the rule.
 Its author had the idea of addicting the computer to the virus by encrypting
 the  hard  disk  and decrypting it on the fly, which it's not destructive by
 itself.  It  also  enhanced the "Com mander Bomber" infection which addicted
 infected  files  to the virus as well. In short, OneHalf was (imho) far more
 ingenious  than  Hare  or  Natas.  It's  quite  curious  how  the  so called
 "effective"  AV  programs were the real "destructors", while not being abl e
 to handle this and other viruses properly.

 >>>>>> Q. How would you consider the perfect virus? ;-)

        There  ain't  such  thing as a perfect virus, anyway such virus would
 have  to  be completely undetectable and untraceable by all means, with full
 stealth capabilities in both memory and files, slowly polymorphic, with fast
 infection  features,  multipartite,  a  ble to infect MBRs, boot sectors and
 multiple file formats as well: DOS/MZ files, Win16/NE files, Win32/PE files,
 OS/2/LX  files, OLE2/DOC/XLS files, Linux/ELF files, OBJ/LIB OMF/COFF files,
 ZIP,  ARJ,  RAR,  CAB,  LZH compressed files etc, etc. It would also have to
 work on different platforms (Linux, MacOS, OS/2, Win3.1, Win9x, WinNT, etc.)
 This  virus  would  have to be as small as possible and as bug-free as could
 be.  A  bit difficult for any virus with so much features like this one, but
 you asked, heh ;-).


 >>>>>> Q. What do you think about destructive viruses?

        It was perhaps the fact that I had a very bad experience with "Natas"
 virus  -  we  lost  a  whole  hard disk at the comp store - that I got a bit
 paranoid  about  destructive  code.  I  really don't like at all any kind of
 destructive  rubbish  in  any  form  or  means, including in a virus, trojan
 horse,  worms,  etc. I disagree with people who write destructive code (file
 deletion,  disk  formatting,  etc.)  for  the  simple reason that I know for
 myself  how  harmful  such  destructive code can be. However I wrote viruses
 since I have a different opinion on what a virus is ;-).

 >>>>>> Q.  All  along  the  virus  history  and  the  VX scene itself, which
 "original" viruses deserve to be reminded and why?

        Well  I  think  those viruses which proposed new infection ideas, new
 means  of  memory residency, new infectable file formats, etc. deserve to be
 reminded  somewhat  along  the  whole  virus  history.  I  could name a few:
 "Jerusalem"  -  said  to  be  the  first  file inf ector, though I doubt it,
 "Brain"  -  said  to  be  the  first  boot  sector virus ever, the bulgarian
 viruses:  "Number  of  the  Beast"  -  for  being  the  first "full stealth"
 infector, the "Dark Avenger" virus - the first fast infector and the "Dir-2"
 virus - for ha ving developed a new original infection technique. "Commander
 Bomber" follows - for its kickass approach of inserting chunks of virus code
 all  along  the  host,  also "Concept" and "DMV" - for being the first macro
 viruses  ever,  etc.  I  know  there are quite a lot more advanced bugs that
 deserve  to  be  mentioned as well, but damnit, I'm far from being a rolling
 virus enciclopedia ;-).

 >>>>>> Q.  Do  you want to make an appeal to anyone? (beginners, ex-writers,
 whole scene)

        Beginners: Please don't write intentionally destructive code.
        Ex-writers: I'm coming aboard, erm my fingers just start to rust..
        Whole  scene:  Hot  than  ever  before.  Groups/Independants: make it
 worth!

 >>>>>> Q. What else do you do when you aren't coding a virus ?

        I  currently  work  for  a big Telecoms company. I spend all morning,
 noon  and  part  of  the  afternoon working for the project management team.
 Curiously  I  seldom  sit  in front of a computer ;-), except when I have to
 write down those bored reports for my boss, or those excel sheets, etc.

        However,  in  spite  of my stressful job, I find time most afternoons
 after  work to go mountain biking in the Peruvian Andes with my friends from
 the  old  mountain  bike team at Uni. I find this activity very pleasant and
 healthy for my brain and lungs, so I practice it at least twice a week.

        I  also find time most nights for my pretty girlfriend Carol, to help
 her  with  her  undergrad studies in psychology, mostly with her statistical
 and  maths  related  courses.  Most  weekends  however,  we go out with some
 friends to the movies, discos, or just ch at in a cybercafe bar for a while.

 >>>>>> Q. Where can you be reached ?

        I    still    can    be   contacted   through   my   email   address:
 jqwerty@cryogen.com.  If I delay too much in replying it's perhaps because I
 am  specially  hurried  those days, or maybe you asked a very stupid/obvious
 question  that  deserves  no  answer  at  all, or probably you asked a virus
 related  question.  Please remember I'm retired. That means no virus related
 questions.  There  are plenty of Win32 coders better than me nowadays. Visit
 the official Win32 ASM Programming homepage for some of them.

 >>>>>> Q. Any greetings ?

        29A:  Hey you have strong competition here: SLAM! Lord Julus: Perhaps
 in the next eclipse? ;-) SLAM: Keep up the good work buddies! VX scene: Keep
 the scene alive!

 >>>>>> Q. Any final word?

        I  want  to  thank  the SLAM team specially Lord Julus for this great
 opportunity. I'm glad to see how the SLAM team has evolved from being solely
 a  macro  VX  related  zine  to  what  it  is  today:  a  highly  active and
 heterogeneous virus team with very talented virus coders. Keep it up!

        Jacky Qwerty.-
