 % Lord Julus %

        Just  wanted to gather some words for eternity from as many people as
 I  could... Here are the answers in the exact order as I received them in my
 mailbox...


 % Mr.Sandman %

        Lord  Julus,  one  of my best friends in the virus scene, asked me to
 write  a  few  words for eternity. I didn't know what to say until i thought
 about eternity itself...

 To see a world in a grain of sand
 And a heaven in a wild flower
 Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
 And eternity in an hour.

        In  maltese,  which  is  the  language i speak everyday together with
 english since i'm living in Malta, it sounds like...

 Biex tara lid-dinja fi frak tar-ramel
 U l-genna f'fjura salvagga
 Zomm ghal-dejjem fil-palma ta' idejk
 U l-infinite f'siegha.

        This  is  an  excerpt from "Auguries Of Innocence", by William Blake,
 which  is  known  by almost every virus writer after it was used in the well
 known Maltese Amoeba.

        Let me say it's a small part of my next project... ;)


 % Putoksa Kawayan %

        A  virus  zine  is always welcome in the virus scene Knowing how good
 you are in what you are doing I know this one is sure going to come out fine
 Lots of luck on your new endeavor.

 % Lethal Mind %

        I  want  to  thank all the guys from 29A who greatly helped me and to
 Pockets. Now a small advice for the beginner : Read read read read, and then
 read  again...  Once  you've read everything, start to code... ANYTHING, but
 code. And don't ask silly questions on undernet, or you'll meet my foot ;)

 % Shaitan %

        Anyways,  my  message goes out to all vx-ers in India: "Wake up guys!
 And drop me a mail at shaitan@psynet.net". Also, to all those who think SLAM
 is dead: "WE'RE NOT! We'll be back..."

 % Silence %

        Vx  is  a  form  of art And The AV:ers are the critics who tryies too
 destroy it.

% Reptile %

        Ok i'd like to say that "it's smart to shave your ass daily..."

% The Wizard %

        "I`ts  time  to  take  a  look  to  the future ... this means Windows
 viruses  and such like, but INMO i think its too boring ( get k32 , get apis
 ... ). Anyway .. lets play! ;)"

% Mental Driller %

        The  limit  of  virus  making  is  only in the mind of the anti-virus
 makers.
