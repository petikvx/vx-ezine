        Outside people
        ==============

        Everyone  in  the VX and AV scene have different points of view about
 the  relative side. For example there are coders in the VX side that have as
 first thing to try new technic of coding and fuck the AV programs. There are
 coders  that  write  viruses  like an artist makes something of personal and
 there  are  coders that write viruses because they consider creating viruses
 is to create life and many other point of view everyone interesting.

        In the other side there are AV coders that every day find new viruses
 and  update  the programs in a game that will be infinite. New viruses = New
 AV programs = new knowledge for all !!!!

        But  in this 2 side or worlds there are few people that many in the 2
 sides condiser outsiders: People like me, SlageHammer.

        Everyone  that  knows  me know that i am a virus collector and tester
 like  other friends, like Cicatrix and VirusBuster and Tally but for example
 the  AV  side  considers  people  like  me in the VX side maybe because, for
 example me I am member of a Virus Writing group.

        This  article  wants to show to the 2 sides that in the 2 sides there
 are people in the middle because some virus coders sometimes want to send to
 AV companies their new bugs but for some reasons can not do by themselves so
 they  ask  this  to me and sometimes people in the AV send me new version of
 their  program  to  know  my  point  of view about them and if in my opinion
 detects a good % of the new viruses around.

        It's  true  that  sometimes i send stuff to the av companies but it's
 only  when  an author asks this directly to me and only if the autor asks to
 me  to  send  the stuff. No other stuff is sent without a permission!!!!! In
 the  other side when i got a new version again not released of an AV program
 I use it only for my test and when i found something wrong in it, I send the
 list of the problems but not the files that generated the problem.

        So  i  think  that in the reality there are not 2 sides but 3: one on
 the  left,  one  on  the right and one in the middle. People like me are the
 competition  to  create  viruses  maybe  not  relly  good viruses but anyway
 viruses  but  the  first  interest  is  to  find  new stuff for the personal
 collection and new information in the 2 sides without giving out information
 relative to one specific file or a type. It is true that for me is important
 primary  to  help  the  brothers in the vx side with all my stuff and all my
 knowledge  and  i  use  all  this  information not to help the AV men but to
 incremetate  the  knowledge  in  the  vx  side even when i discover a new av
 program  that  maybe has something new in front of other av, and in the same
 time  when i check my stuff with a new av and it crashes send the program to
 the  companies  with the result of the scan but without the virus file. So i
 think  to  be  usefull  to  the  2  sides  and to get knowledge is something
 everyone is interested.

        All  this  is my point about myself and i don't want to offend anyone
 and a side.This is only a way to show at the public that someone consider me
 an  AV  or  VX or an intruder. MY position is always clear and if i can help
 someone in someway i do it without exit to the ethic to give out things that
 are only for me.

        Anyway  i  am a virus collector and i like to get as soon as possible
 new  stuff so if reading it anyone has any or want to send any to me, always
 is welcome!!!
