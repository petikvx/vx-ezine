        It's  been  three  years  since  my  first  encounter  with the virus
 programming  field  and  I  have to say that, from the information gathering
 point  of  view,  from the understanding point of view and from the point of
 view  of  the  research  itself,  they  were  three  magnificent years. As a
 beginner  I  stumbled  over tutorials, vx magazines and virus sources once I
 got  myself  hooked to the Internet... After that, it was just a small step.
 As a virus writter I cannot say I was successful, because I wasnt. Maybe the
 main thing beyond my viral activity incognaisance is the fact that I really,
 really  get bored so quicly. Once I manage to reach a certain goal, I cannot
 be bothered to make all the banalities in order to make it a complete virus.
 That's  why  I  mainly decided to write tutorials and include there the most
 part  of  my knoledge and ideas. However, I found myself at a certain point,
 wondering  why was I really doing this? This is how this article emerged, an
 article in which I will try to peruse the motivation behind the virus writer
 and  to  point out a trend for a virus writer's activity. I would be so glad
 to  receive  any  ideas  on this issue (after you read this...) on my e-mail
 address  (lordjulus@geocities.com)  in  order  to make the best virus author
 portret. Thanx.

 °°°±±±±±²²²²²²²ÛÛÛÛŞ      Who is the virus writter?     İÛÛÛÛ²²²²²²²±±±±±°°°
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ


        There  are  quite a few things that catch the people's eyes when they
 first  meet with a computer. Just to mention some: games, demos, multimedia,
 etc.  It is not long until the people start to think: how can I do all those
 things...  It is then when people start purchasing books and start to learn.
 But,  don't  get  me  wrong,  only a part of people are actually doing that.
 Above  a  certain  age,  nobody  is  willing to learn to code anymore. In my
 humble opinion the age of the person who starts to learn coding goes from 15
 years old until 25 years old.

        Before  15  years  the  mind  is  not complete to understand the main
 concepts  behind  programming.  I don't say that younger people cannot code,
 but  surely  until  15 years old they will not be bright (note that I do not
 consider the genius cases, which exist).

        Also,  if you didn't learn to code at least one language until 25, it
 is 90% sure that you will never do. Even the age between 21-25 is difficult.
 The  difficulties  come  from the beginning of the family, or only sex life,
 which kinda drags the people into society and away from the dark side of the
 Internet chat.

        However,  if  you  did  learn  to  code  until 25, you could probably
 continue  to  do  so  until 80, but for sure you will start looking at other
 fields than virus writting. The reason for that is that if one decides to go
 into  the  computers  bussiness,  he  must also earn money... No can do with
 viruses for that!

        So,  the  age  of  the  virus writer is 15-25. I know the spread is a
 little big, but it is true...

        Now,  let's  focus on the gender. It is of no question that 99.99% of
 thevirus  authors  are  men.  The  0.01% which are women probably only think
 about  it.  I have no clear explanation on this issue, but I guess it can be
 found  by  researching men's desire of conquest, opposite to women desire of
 inner  achieving and interiorization. Men like to be liked and are trying to
 do  it  by  force sometimes, even if it is obvious that the goal will not be
 achived  (I  had  a  college  mate  who  used  to poke his face with needles
 thinking  girls  will like him... None did...) Women also try to impose, but
 if  they do not achive this they retire inside themselves and even cry. Man,
 tries  to get revenge... Also, you could consider that the 'technical world'
 is  more  a  men's  world. Rather than writing a virus, a women would better
 poke  you  with the scissors. Men try to find more "delicate" ways to obtain
 even bigger results.

        Talking  about  the  family  could bring even more light on the virus
 author  portret.  First  of  all,  it  takes  some money to earn a computer.
 Usually people that get their PCs at their command, the next day, are people
 who  do  not  worry  about  money and they will probably *never* think about
 writing viruses. They will probably not even open their computer but to play
 games  or use Microsoft Office (bleah!). It's the people that have to *earn*
 their  computer that will probably write viruses. There is a very small line
 linking  hacking  and phreaking to virus authoring. If you don't have money,
 you  will  try  to learn how to steal credit cards and how to foul the phone
 company.  It's  a  very small step until virus writing. Suddenly all that is
 ilegal  gives  you  a  special feeling, something that drags you to do it...
 Also,  the  atmosphere  in  the house must influence that. A stressed person
 will  try  to  refulate  in  the  computer. A person living in a family with
 problems (quarels, fights, etc), will isolate himself in the dark circles of
 the irc chat and other forms of cyber talk. So, i'd say that the usual virus
 writer comes from a family with some problems and not having sufficent money
 to fulfill all the desires.

        I'd have to say, that myself, I am pretty much in this picture.

        Also,  on  very  important  thing.  Sometimes  the  virus  author  is
 presented  like some kind of antisocial creature almost close to a murderer.
 Instead,  most  of  the  virus  authors  I know are very intelligent people,
 attending  Universities  and  colleges, and all of them are pretty sure they
 will  drop  this hobby after geting into the real life (that's when geting a
 full time job... ;-/)

        This  was a brief description of the external factors that could lead
 to virus writing, IMHO, of course... Criticize if you like...

 °°°±±±±±²²²²²²²ÛÛÛÛŞ How virus writing attracts people? İÛÛÛÛ²²²²²²²±±±±±°°°

        The  answer  to this question is fairily simple. Basically *anything*
 which can make a person appear in a nice picture in front of the others will
 always   attract  him.  This  is  why  demo  making  attracts  so  much  the
 programmers.  Demos  are cool and nice. However, they are pretty hard to do.
 But  viruses  are not so hard, and still one can make his name go around the
 world just with some hundred lines of code. This is why usualy virus authors
 will  not  stay  too much in the safe place given by anonymacy. Most of them
 will  join a group or more, or even form a new one, and will start to act on
 the  Internet.  How  can you wonder why virus writing attract people? It's a
 way that can make you:

        -programm at your place, drinking beer and having fun
        -get your code on other computers all around the world
        -get in touch with a lot of smart people in the bussiness
        -make friends and spend nice time with them
        -get famous!

        No need to go any furthure.

 °°°±±±±±²²²²²²²ÛÛÛÛŞ    Virus authors classification    İÛÛÛÛ²²²²²²²±±±±±°°°
 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

        Well,  like  any other classification, mine is also touched by my own
 subjectivism.  It  is  normal  to be so, as from the definition of the being
 itself,  a  personal  opinion  is  subjective.  It  is objective only if the
 statement is a know and accepted truth, which is not the case here. So, this
 is my own classification. Deal with it! ;-)

        So, my categorization goes like this:

        1.Learning  freaks-  these  are  the  people who will learn fast just
 about  anything  concerning computers and virus writing will be just a small
 step in their entire programming career and will help them develop different
 techniques.

        2.Bored  programmers-  these  are the guys who probably work a lot on
 computers  at  work  but  still they are addicted to computers. At home they
 feel  like  doing  something  different.  Virus  writing could be one of the
 possible escapes.

        3.Adrenalided  teenagers-  very  young  people  who  got  a  grip  on
 computers  and  "they  wanna  sh0w  the w0rld!!". Usually the most dangerous
 virus  authors;  however  easy  to  be  scared.  I assume these are the wide
 spreaders.  But  if they get cought once, they will probably quit doing this
 and start making exploding rockets or something.

        4.Deceptioned  people-  here  is  a  very strange category, I assume.
 These  are  people  that  were  deceptioned  in  life and feel like taking a
 revenge  on the whole world. For example people left by their lovers, people
 who failed some very important exams or were kicked of their jobs. The anger
 is fulfilled in revenge through a deadly virus.

        5.Funny  people-  these are probably the least dangerous people. They
 make  viruses for fun and their payload is usually one that should amuse the
 user  (if  we  could  say  so).  For  example  displaying a picture of their
 favorite star, or print some lyrics of their favorite group.

        6.Money  makers-  this  is  a  very  dangerous  breed. They would get
 friendly  with  almost  all  virus writters and learn stuff. Then they would
 release a virus and after that, under a different name, an anti-virus. I say
 dangerous  because  I  do  not like this kind of double life. But in reality
 their  viruses  cannot  be  really dangerous because if they get cought they
 could be in really big trouble.

        7.Sceners-  I  call  like  this people who are in the scene, write in
 their  entire life one or maybe two viruses, but their activity is very low.
 They simply enjoy the company of the "bad guys" and they like to hang around
 them.  They lack fame at home or at school but around the scene they can act
 really cool.
 

        Note  that  this classification has nothing to do with the quality of
 the  viruses  written.  For  example a Scener could write the best virus and
 then  retire,  or  a  funny  guy  could  write  a  very  advanced virus. The
 classification  takes  into  account  the comportament of the people and the
 "thing" pushing him to do it.

        My  conclusion  doesn't  only  apply  to  virus  authors, but also to
 hackers,  crackers  and  phrackers.  It goes like this: as long as computers
 will  exist,  no  matter  how complicated and/or secured will they be, there
 will  always  exist  virus  authors.  You think you can contradict this with
 arguments?  I don't think so, but if you do, I can hardly wait. I'd say that
 my  conclusion  goes like an axiom. You cannot prove it, but it is more than
 clear  that  it  is  true. So, do not even think that the virus authors will
 vanish  eventualy  with  the  new  operating  systems and new tools. We will
 always  be here in one or another form... So beware... We could work in your
 company... We could be one of the network administrators... We could be your
 children... ;-> Gotta learn to live with us...
