        It  is  always  the  fear  that  gets all people whenever it comes to
 changing the normal, usual, used ways. It's the same as always in life. It's
 like  when  you  change  the  college or workplace, or even your car. In the
 beginning there is something that keeps you from going, something that draws
 you  backwards  and  seems  to be holding you steady. Of course, that little
 thing  will  not  dissapear  by  itself. Instead, it takes a lot of work and
 strength to overcome the hardness of the situation and get over the facts.

        This  is  the same situation when we think about the win32 system. It
 looks  hard for most people to move from normal Dos assembly language to the
 win32  assembly language. Now, I am not going to tell you that in fact it is
 a piece of cake, because it isn't and I am not going to tell you that I am a
 master  in  it,  bacause I am not. All that I will try to do in a few little
 articles  is to give you some guidelines, like a startup, from where you can
 build up your own work.

        So,  the  Win32  is a name given by its programmers to an application
 programming  interface (API). So, basically the entire Win32 system consists
 of  a  set of functions, structures and constants defined. The functions can
 be  called  from  within  the  code and all actions can be performed via the
 Win32 APIs.

        Currently  the win32 system exists on five platforms: Win32s, Windows
 NT, Windows 95, Windows CE and Windows 2000. Note that Win32s is the name of
 the  Win32  system  implemented in the Windows 3.1, and Windows 2000 doesn't
 exist but in it's beta pre-release. In these articles no refferences will be
 made  to  either  Win32s nor Windows 2000. Also, note that there also exists
 the  Windows 98, but in these articles I will also call it 95 because of the
 similarities.

 = The difference between NT and 95 =

        The  Windows  NT  is  from  far the best operating system produced by
 Microsoft.  This  OS  has  no  MS-DOS background and is thought as to be the
 operating  system  of  the  future.  However the huge ammounts of memory and
 storage  space required by the system, as well as it's price made Windows NT
 not so accessible for all users. However, and mock my words!, the Windows NT
 *will* be the most used operating system in the future.

        The Windows NT's main feature is the complete closure of all types of
 accesses  to  the  low  level  resources of the system. Under Windows NT one
 cannot  access  I/O ports. Any application that is trying to do this will be
 immediately terminated.

        For  the moment, however, due to it's smaller size and smaller prize,
 the  Windows  95  operating  system is the most used OS from Microsoft right
 now.  It  replaced the good old 16bit Windows 3.x and the attempt to a Win32
 system called Win32s.

        The  thing  to  note  is that Windows 95's Win32 system contains less
 APIs than the full version from Windows NT (please note that Windows NT also
 has some APIs missing, but only to add robustness to the OS).

        So,  even if in the future the Windows NT will be the leading OS, for
 quite a long time Windows 95 will remain the most used operating system.

        So,  finally we come to our conclusion: in order to assure one of the
 most  important feature for a virus, one *must* write Windows NT and Windows
 95 compatible code. We shall try to cover this topic later.

        And  as  a  final  conclusion:  MS-DOS  is  dead. Win32 is the future
 system. Everybody *MUST* move to the Win32 programming. Please, read on as I
 will try to introduce you in the Win32 little by little.
