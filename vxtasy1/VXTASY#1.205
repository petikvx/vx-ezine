        Well,  the relation between viral activity and *any* operating system
 is  more than obvious. It is a know rule that any lock can be broke. This is
 reflected  in  the  computer fields as "any program can be hacked", or, more
 deep,  or  more specific, if you want, in the virus field as "any system can
 be infected".

        The  above  sentance  has  a little more than meets the eye. First of
 all,  it  is  not  true.  To make it better we should change it to "any weak
 system  can be infected". Try taking a look at the Unix system. Widely used,
 this  one  didn't  meet  the problems that the Microsoft systems did. Let me
 remind  you that more then 20000 viruses exist only for the MS-DOS platform,
 while almost none for the Unix platform.

        This  made  it  more than normal for programmers to look at something
 new. This was kindly offered by our friends from Microsoft under the form of
 Windows.  Back in time what seemed like an add-on for the computer, a simple
 utility  to help you in the office, Windows looked like a pretty cool thing.
 But  the strangeness of the NewExe format made it not so easy for authors to
 infect it. I'd say that compared with the existing possibilities, the number
 of  Windows  3.x  viruses  was  way  too small. Why? Simple... Because quick
 enough  Microsoft  crafted  a  new  little monster and unleashed it into the
 world.  It  was  a  real  Pandora's box opened with no shame. It was the new
 implementation  of  the  Win32  system. A new implementation that came under
 different  faces:  Windows 95 and it's "improved" children: OSR2 and Windows
 98, and Windows NT 4.0.

        I  basically  think that the idea of making an universal system, that
 should  work  regardless of the existing hardware is nice. However, too much
 room  is, after all, too much room... I think that Microsoft didn't consider
 enough   the threat that came together with the release of the Win32 system.
 Sure, it was normal for users to be struck by a bit of fear, when seeing the
 new  methods  in  the Win32, and I reckon this is what Microsoft based their
 theory  on. But assuming that due to the hardness of the Win32 system no one
 will  learn  it  was a terrible mistake. It took a few years but now I'd say
 that  the  threat  over  the  Win32  system is a threat no more. A threat is
 something  that  eventually  *might*  not  come, whilst the infection of the
 Win32 system is a certainity and something which cannot be ignored any more.

        I  have  to say, with the hand on my heart, that the Win32 system has
 gone.  It  was  taken  over.  The  battle  has  been won by the hard working
 programmers...

        Of  course, this doesn't mean that the war has been won... Nope... In
 the  quite  near future we are expecting the new version of the Win32 system
 which  will run under the name of Windows2000. I think this is gonna be some
 kind  of WindowsNT running under a Windows98 GUI. I tell you now that things
 are  gonna  be  changed  again.  Kernel  addresses, low level stuff, lots of
 things...

        What will this do to us? Nothing... Just offering a NEW START!!!
