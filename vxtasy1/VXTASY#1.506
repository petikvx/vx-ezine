        Some  jokes  from  the net to freshen you up a little. You might know
 them, but a little remembrance doesn't hurt... Have fun...

 ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 BILL GATES GOES TO HEAVEN
 ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

        Bill  Gates  dies  in  a car accident. He finds himself in purgatory,
 being sized up by St. Peter.
        "Well,  Bill,  I'm really confused on this call; I'm not sure whether
 to  send  you to Heaven or Hell. After all, you enormously helped society by
 putting  a  computer  in  almost every home in America, yet you also created
 that  ghastly  Windows '95. I'm going to do something I've never done before
 in your case; I'm going to let you decide where you want to go."
        Bill  replied,  "well,  what's  the  difference between the two?" St.
 Peter  said,  "I'm  willing to let you visit both places briefly, if it will
 help your decision."

        "Fine, but where should I go first?"

        "I'll leave that up to you."

        "Okay then," said Bill, "Let's try Hell first."

        So  Bill  went  to  Hell. It was a beautiful, clean, sandy beach with
 clear  waters  and  lots of bikini-clad women running around, playing in the
 water,  laughing  and frolicking about. The sun was shining; the temperature
 perfect. He was very pleased.

        "This  is  great!" he told St. Peter. "If this is hell, I REALLY want
 to see heaven!""Fine," said St. Peter, and off they went.

        Heaven  was  a  place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about,
 playing  harps  and  singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell. Bill
 thought  for  a  quick minute, and rendered his decision. "Hmmm. I think I'd
 prefer Hell," he told St. Peter.

        "Fine," retorted St. Peter, "as you desire."

        So Bill Gates went to Hell.

        Two  weeks  later, St. Peter decided to check on the late billionaire
 to  see  how  he  was  doing  in  Hell.  When  he  got there, he found Bill,
 shackled to a wall, screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned
 and tortured by demons.

        "How's everything going?" he asked Bill.

        Bill   responded,   with   his   voice   filled   with   anguish  and
 disappointment,

        "This  is  awful!  This  is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks
 ago!  I  can't believe this is happening! What happened to that other place,
 with   the  beautiful  beaches,  the  scantily-clad  women  playing  in  the
 water?!???"

        "That was a demo," replied St. Peter.

 IS WINDOWS A VIRUS?
 ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

 No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses do:

 1. They replicate quickly -- okay, Windows does that.

 2. Viruses use up valuable system resources, slowing down the system
 as they do so -- okay, Windows does that.

 3. Viruses will, from time to time, trash your hard disk -- okay,
 Windows does that, too.

 4. Viruses are usually carried, unknown to the user, along with
 valuable programs and systems. Sigh... Windows does that, too.

 5. Viruses will occasionally make the user suspect their system is
 too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware. Yup, that's
 with Windows, too.

 6. Viruses do unknown tasks in the background...so does windows.

        Until  now  it  seems  Windows  is  a virus but there are fundamental
 differences:  Viruses  are  well  supported by their authors, are running on
 most  systems,  their  program  code is fast, compact and efficient and they
 tend to become more sophisticated as they mature.

 So, Windows is not a virus.

 GOD, BILL & BORIS
 ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ

        God  called  a  meeting of Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Gates
 and said:
        "I've  given  you  all  the tools you needed to make a better world -
 you've blown it and I'm ending the world in two weeks."

        Bill  Clinton went on TV and said "I have good news and bad news. The
 good news is that God exists. The bad news is that the world will end in two
 weeks."

        Boris  Yeltsin called his advisors together and said "I have bad news
 and  *really* bad news. The bad news is that God exists. The really bad news
 is that the world will end in two weeks."

        Bill  Gates called his co-workers together and said "I have good news
 and really good news. The good news is that God thinks I am one of the three
 most  powerful  people  in  the world. The really good news is that we don't
 have to fix windows 95."
