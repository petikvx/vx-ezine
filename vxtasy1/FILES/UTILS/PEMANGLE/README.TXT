
PEMangle.ASM

        This is a mild encryption tool for Win32 applications. It is far from
 being  good,  it was meant only to show the possibilities. It might not work
 with  all  PE  files as it is not fully error checked. However, assemble the
 TEST.ASM file and try it out.

 Command line:

        PEMANGLE <filename>

        To compile PEMANGLE type:

        MAKE

        but  be sure you set the right directory for the import32.lib file in
 the MAKEFILE file.

        DISCLAIMER:  This  utility  was not tested to the full extent and the
 author  may  not  be held responsible for the damages produced on certain PE
 files which rendered them to being unfunctionable.
