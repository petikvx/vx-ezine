        I  named this article 'some stuff' mainly because... well that's what
 it  is...  Firstly I wanted to name it some news, but then I realized that I
 have  no  time to gather 'new' news, or even so, those news would be already
 old,  so  I  gave up... Also, what I wanted to say here is notoriety already
 and thus, no news...

        First  of all, the virus scene is shaken again... Not only that it is
 fucked  up,  as from three years now, but it is also shaken. Being fucked up
 comes from the fast changing of the operating system on the PCs, as you will
 read  along  in  the  Win32  articles, but the shaking comes from government
 involvment in the underground activity...

        It's  of good knowledge that the activity of the so called antisocial
 groups,  like  hackers,  phreakers,  virus  writers, etc... was, is and will
 always be monitored by the government. Actually not quite by the government,
 but by some organizations that respond to the government and have the unique
 role of covering this area. It is very important from their point of view to
 let  the  people express themselves. First of all, anything which is free is
 less  likely  to  happen. And, opposite, what is forbidden is searched to be
 done...  Like  the  forbidden  apple...  On the other side, the minds of the
 people  out there can sometimes hold treasures, and the govt. is so happy to
 use  their  ideas  for  free...  Both  these things make the govt. leave the
 underground to work and use the fruits.

        But it comes a time when the govt. itself feels threatened. I remeber
 a  movie where I first felt in love with the actress of my dreams. The movie
 was  "The  Net".  Here,  the company that was protecting the entire American
 system  was  also  the one hacking into the system. This is the kind of fear
 you  don't wanna feel... It's like being at work and seeing in the newspaper
 the  photo  of  an escaped serial killer, which happens to look exactly like
 the  housekeeper  you  hired  yesterday  to  babysit your children... Get my
 point?

        That  is  the  time  when the official feel that they need to sort of
 show  off. Show to the world, that the underground exists by their allowence
 and that anytime they can crush it...

        And  here  we come to what happened this year with the Melissa virus.
 Not being a very complicated one, the Melissa virus had two qualities. First
 of  all,  it  was original. And second of all, it showed huge bug holes into
 one  of  the  leading  softwares  available, the Microsoft Outlook, and also
 shading  a  black  light on the name of the releasing company, the Microsoft
 monster.  The  unique  quality  came from that it was able to spread through
 e-mail  (actually  it was not completely unique, or new, but the method used
 was  original).  I  remember  a  while ago while arguing on different e-mail
 lists  about  the existance of the mail spreading virus. I remember standing
 along  the  idea  that  it couldn't, cannot and will not exist, *unless* the
 user  is stupid enough to run it!! It was valable then and it stands now to.
 The Melissa virus is not able to spread on a system unless the user detaches
 the  e-mail  and opens the file. Those are two actions which pose a question
 on  the  persons' IQ if they happen. However, somebody up there decided that
 it  is the time to *show off*. VicodinES, the supposed author of Melissa got
 arrested,  funny  because of a Microsoft Office bug which left a mark on the
 original file leading to the computer. Suddenly, a big FTP area which hosted
 many  vx  related  pages  was  shut  down  by  the  FBI. We all remember the
 sourceofkaos  pages...  Also, pushed by their luck, the FBI decided to close
 down  the  page of the Codebreakers group (the codebreakers released a virus
 which  was  able  to steal PGP keys and upload them to ftp.codebreakers.com;
 until  the  witchhunt began the FBI didn't touch their site, but only warned
 people  to  hold it as hostile). After the page was closed and the group was
 disbanded,  suddenly  a  big silence sorounded everything. In the mean time,
 the  biggest  free  web  page  hosts,  Tripod and Geocities, began a massive
 action  of shuting down vx related web pages. My page was killed in this war
 and I was forced to move to xoom.

{       Please  not  that  as  from a few days ago, The Codebreakers are back
 together and released their 5th e-zine. Looks like God is still around ;-) }

        Did  this  help?!? Did this help, I repeat?!? Man, it's like shouting
 on the radio: hay, people in 10 minutes there will be a 7 degree earthquake.
 What  are  you going to do?!? What are you going to do? Stay in the house or
 rush outside and be really, really in panic?

        After  all  this  crap,  which  made  such a big publicity, the virus
 writters  saw the big hole offered by the Microsoft tools and started to use
 them.  One  by  one, more and more e-mail worms are starting to appear. This
 year and the next, I think, will be the years of the e-mail worm.

        In  this  e-zine I will not speak about them as I have no interest in
 them,  but  mock  my  words (I like this ;-)): soon the e-mail worms will be
 everywhere!!

        I  remember reading the virus-l list hosted by Nick Fitzgerald, and I
 recall  reading  mails  written  by people working in NAI, DataFellows, etc.
 They  were  presenting the big clashes, the data loss and all the bad things
 that  will  happen due to the Melissa big spreading during only one weekend.
 They  were  saying  big  things  like e-mails multiplicating at an EXP rate,
 servers  going  down, bussiness going down the drain... BULL-SHIT!!! Nothing
 happened...  All  the  servers  that  were  closed down were closed by their
 administrators  to  prevent  what could happen. The reality is cruel: nobody
 was  right. Someone showed a real hole in a so called universal software and
 everybody started throwing rocks.

        Hey,  smart  dudes!!  Read  this:  FIRST  WRITE DOWN DECENT PIECES OF
 SOFTWARE AND THEN WINE ABOUT THEM BEING HACKED!! DON'T START SHOUTING BEFORE
 PROVING THE QUALITY OF YOUR WORK!!

        You're gonna have to forgive me for being so angry, but I just cannot
 have this 'we are the boss' kind of stuff...


        As  for  other  news which you might or not hear about already, Jacky
 Qwerty  and  Vecna, two of the best win32 programmers and virus authors quit
 the  scene,  each  for  their  own  reasons  (check the interview with Jacky
 Qwerty). I hope all the best for the 29A group even if it is a tough time.

        Also, please note that my good friend Virtual Daemon told me it is ok
 to  notify  here  that  the  Slam  group  is  dormant,  meaning  there is no
 certainity  that  there will ever exist a new Slam issue due to the members'
 lack of activity. I do hope VD will do just fine in college as he will start
 this year, and also for all the other members.

        As  for  another  group that emerged with much hope and died quickly,
 that is DDT. I haven't got a clue why the memebers didn't continue their job
 after  Billy  Belceb£'s  quit. However, I see some of the members joined the
 Feathered  Serpents,  and  some  look  like  acting  on their own. Good luck
 anyway!

        Also,  we  are  waiting  for the first e-zine from the Ultimate Chaos
 group. Keep it up, guys!!

        Most  people knew that this issue was to be released on 1st of August
 1999.  The  reason  for  the delay is first of all that I *had* to go to the
 seaside  and  have  some fun, the second was that the millenium eclipse just
 took  place  in Romania, and the last but the most important one is that one
 very  good  friend  of  mine  came to visit me here... Actually the story is
 longer.  I  do  not recall exactly how it came to talk about, but I suddenly
 found  out  that Jacky Qwerty is a big eclipse fan and I invited him to come
 over and stay at my place. Because of university reasons, finaly he couldn't
 made  it,  but  instead, guess who came? Mr.Sandman came with his girlfriend
 and they sleep in my bed as I type this ;-). I have to say he is a very cool
 guy  and I hope we will remain friends. I kinda messed up the plan because I
 always seem to set up too many goals and ruin all... My idea was to take him
 and  meet VD near Ramnicu Valcea where the eclipse was to be seen best. But,
 I  had to go to the seaside and MrS came the same day when I left, so he had
 to  stay in my apartment with my mother ;-) They got along pretty well as he
 speaks  a  very good romanian and Miss Sandwoman understands it perfectly. I
 have  to  say  that  this  was  one  of the greatest summers of all. My only
 disappointment  is the fact that I missed the encounter with VD, but we will
 surely meet someday...

        Another  fact  is  that  my  virus  activity will probably decrease a
 little  after  this issue, as I also have other hobbies. For instance, since
 my  childhood  years  I  was  fascinated with writing and Sci-Fi. So, I will
 probably  dedicate some of my time to writing the novel of my life ;-). Wish
 me luck! I need it...;-)

        So, for now this is the stuff... Read and hope you will enjoy it...
