        In  the  beginning...  there  was  VOID... And the void exploded in a
 wheel  of fire and thousands of pieces of dust began to gather together. And
 melted  by fire and blown by the winds the dust became stronger and stronger
 and bigger and bigger. And then, from within the forming rocks, wires of hot
 boiling  water  began to blast out with a terible noise. And the water mixed
 with  the dust and a dark brown matter began to came to life and soround the
 hot  rocks.  And little by little a small round form appeared in what not so
 long ago was a big black void...

      ...And  after  that, the boy sqeezed the black ball of dirt in his hand
 and,  with  a quick smile lighting on his face, he bent a little, rolled his
 hand  around  a  few  times and throw the mud ball away... The window became
 thousands  of  glasses and the old lady came out screaming and holding a big
 stick: "I'm gonna get you, you bastard"...

        "No, you're not," replayed the boy...

        And  suddenly he was a boy no more... He was a big giant looking down
 at the old frightened woman.

        "No  you're  not!! Because I AM THE POWER! And I hold the world to my
 feet now! And nobody will never, ever tell ME what to do anymore!!"

        And with a quick step the giant foot felt on the old womans head...

        "Look...", said the young boy, "a poster with an old woman!!"


        This little intro, sci-fi like, dream like, or whatever you want like
 doesn't  mean  I  usualy  like  to  sqeeze  old  women under my feet. It was
 supposed  to  be,  well,  as  a  metaphor or something... I would let you to
 discover  the  meaning  by  yourself, but this would mean at least a hundred
 meanings, so I will explain it myself. This is the short presentation of the
 little  boy's inner feelings. Whenever we are little, we want to be big. The
 smaller  we are, the more we want the world to be at our feet. The bigger we
 grow  we  start  to understand that... hell, the life is still gonna be over
 one  day,  wether you owned the world or not. And as soon as we do something
 really bad, we want to be kids again, so the biggest punishment would be one
 week grounding.

        Then  we  come to computers... Ehhh... computers. Nice word. The home
 computer  is  a way of achieving, at least partially, some of our dreams and
 thoughts.  And  what  better  way  of  actually  doing  it can there be than
 allowing  the world to see you? None! All you need is a computer, a cable to
 connect you to the Net and a cheap ISP. And then... you HAVE to act!! Having
 the Internet around and not acting would be like keeping a bottle of beer in
 the house more than one hour without drinking it ;-)

        I hope you understand where I am driving to... After this little "why
 are we doing this" kind of presentation, let me tell you who is doing this.

        I  am  so glad of finaly being able to ACT! This time by issuing this
 VX related e-zine where I hope you will find some useful information.

        Unfortunately  (I'll tell you why), I, Lord Julus, am writing this by
 my  own.  I  say  unfortunately because I really like the team work. I don't
 want  any  of  you  to think: "hey, here's another <I do it all> guy"... No,
 that's  not  it... The problem is that it looks like the vx scene is really,
 really, really fucked up, as no one is willing to ACT anymore... Well, I did
 and this is what came out. If you like it, I am glad. If you don't, you know
 your delete commands. Let me brief you about how this came out...

        One  year  ago  I  joined the SLAM group at the kind invitation of my
 good  friend VirtualDaemon. By that time the SLAM group was completely moved
 to  asm  from  macro and had already 4 issues out. I joined exactly when the
 entire  scene was moving fast towards win32 programming. I must say I had an
 excelent  time  in SLAM. VD created a mailing list where we spoke many times
 and  shared  many  ideas. I must say all the guys were absolutely great. You
 might  ask why did I move and tried to publish my own zine? Because I wanted
 to  be  boss?  No  way!! The actual reason is that most of the guys in SLAM,
 including VD were in their final years and moving to colleges. This put SLAM
 in  a  dormant  state, but not disbanded as some rumors were heard. This was
 combined  with  the  fact  that this year I felt like I was at the top of my
 activity.  I don't know if it will last too long, so I decided that I cannot
 wait another year for another issue of SLAM, so I tried to form a new group.
 Unfortunately,  again, I wasn't able to find active people ready to get into
 action.  That's  why I decided to release this, even if it could be my final
 stuff. Though, I'd hate to see the first stuff being also the last stuff...

        The  name  of  the  group  came  to  me suddenly, without any link to
 anything. Just "Virus Extasy" maybe, which became "Vx-tasy".

        Also,  please  note that from the beginning I wanted this issue to be
 the very first win32 only vx e-zine. When I write this there exists no win32
 only  vx e-zine, but until I really release the stuff it might come out. So,
 basically  in  this e-zine I will take win32 from bottom to top and from all
 points  of view which ever interested me. It could look poor to you as I did
 it  all  by myself, but this is the most I can do all alone. However I think
 there  is  some  nice  stuff inside. Please note that I also included my old
 win32  articles,  with  some  mild modification. No, I didn't do it to annoy
 you, but it simply looked ok to me as to make a complete win32 virus writing
 guide. Please note that *this* is the official release of these articles, as
 my  WEB page is purely an informative area, and which also got zapped due to
 it's so called anti-social content... Bullshit! ;-))

        So, I guess that would be the thing about us. Note that I say "us" as
 I  hope that in the future I will be able to gather some other people around
 and  create  a  powerful  group.  I  am thinking about a team of around five
 people, but we shall see what the future brings us.

        Also,  you  might  wonder why a win32 only e-zine is presented into a
 Dos  only environment. Well... call it conservatorism... I still have to say
 that I like more what you can achieve using the Dos text mode, more than the
 clasical  Windows  faces. Besides, the short time didn't allow me to write a
 Win32  viewer,  even  if it is more than simple... Maybe next time, or maybe
 never ;-) (I like being dramatic, don't I? ;-))

        Some more notes, now... Please nottice that this issue is more on the
 tutorial  side.  I  wasn't able to write more than one new virus for you and
 this  is all because of the lack of time. However, I think you may find many
 interesting  things  in the tutorial I wrote. The presence of my older win32
 viruses in this issue is purely for their perpetuation. My WEB page might be
 erased  any  moment  and  I  wanted  these  babies  to  live  in  a friendly
 environment, e.g. an electronical zine...

        And  at  last,  but  not at least: if you have any comments, critics,
 whatever, please feel free to fill in the survey and send it over to me...

        All the best,
                      people !!
