INVASION OF THE CYBERPUNKS

By Clark Staten

Chicago, IL - The modem lights blink as a screeching sound
signifies that the two computers have established a
connection.  Like thousands of other "data calls" that are
transmitted throughout the country each day, this call may be
an innocuous transfer of some numbers from one company's
spreadsheet to another.  But, then again, it also may be the
work of a member of the little known techno-underground . . . 
of a so-called "Cyberpunk".

Who or what is a "cyberpunk"?  He is typically in his late
teens or early 20's, extremely bright, is introverted, has
owned or worked with computers for several years, and
probably doesn't have much respect for what the
counter-culture calls "the establishment".  Many cyberpunks
are the best and brightest of the computer hacker
evolutionary chain.  Most spend much their time
"on-line" in the sightless and quiet "cyberspace world" of
datastreams, modems, and computer software.

The terms "cyberspace" and "cyberpunk" evolved from the world
of science fiction writers and stories.  Early in the 1980's,
a novel called "Neuromancer", written by William Gibson,
helped to shape the image of a cyberpunk.  Reportedly, he took
many of his themes from "underground rock-and-rollers" of the
punk-music scene and transferred the aggressiveness and
seditiousness to the use of computer technology.  The actual
term "cyberpunk" was reportedly coined by a short story
writer by the name of Bruce Bethke.

Many of today's cyberpunks were believed to be the better
educated and more radical "hackers" of the early 80's. In the
early days of "hacking", most practitioners did not intend to
cause damage to the computer systems that they invaded.
Early "hackers" were not generally considered
malicious. In fact, to be termed a "hacker" was originally
considered a compliment. In its earlier context, "hacker"
meant someone who could fashion a workable way to generate
effective computer code, often to solve difficult software
problems.

Most hackers say that they were simply exploring other
computers and trying to learn more about computers and
programming.  They point to the exaggerated costs of computer
hardware, software, and programming tools in the early
1980's, and most say that they just wanted to "borrow" some
information or programs.  The challenge, they say, was simply
to gain entrance into college, business, and government
computers and learn something others didn't know.

As time went on, the challenges became fewer, information
seemed more frightening, and some hackers began to develop a
very definite attitude toward the government and multi-
national corporations that they were invading.  Some
bored and talented hackers/programmers began to experiment
with writing computer code that caused various kinds of
real and imaginary malfunctions to occur, when executed.
These now infamous codes have come to be known as a computer
viruses.  Scores of these crippling or even destructive
viruses are written and unleashed on unsuspecting computer
users every year.

Others went in other directions, and used more sophisticated
methods of manipulating both the telephone systems and the
user interfaces of computers all over the world. Various
colors ( blue, black, etc.) of electronic boxes were built
for the purposes of "phone phreaking" or breaking into
regional phone networks and subverting them to provide for
many hours of free phone calls for the cyberpunks to explore
more distant computers.  Various strategies were developed
for dialing into and out of private companies to use their
telephone accounts free and to disguise the routes of the
actual connections that the cyberpunks used.

As the frequency of intrusion increased, and the more
aggressive "punks" began to experiment with stealing
corporate and military secrets, and planting evil "Logic
Bombs", "Worms", and "Trojan Horses" to cause computers to
self-destruct.  Federal law enforcement agencies were called
in to stop the trespasses.  In 1990, the FBI and Secret
Service undertook an operation called "SUNDEVIL". Raids were
conducted on private BBS's (Bulletin Board Systems) that
supported or even fostered the cyberpunk mystique and allowed
the "punks" collectively to communicate and share information
that would help others to break into new and different
computer systems.

A similar investigation and raid was conducted in the
Chicago, IL. area, in 1991.  Evidence had been collected by
federal officials that some segments of computer control code
that were used in the 911 emergency telephone system by
Southwestern and Illinois Bell had been compromised by
Illinois cyberpunks.  Confiscation of another BBS and a large
amount of computer software was undertaken in the Illinois
raid.  Questions of illegal entry, possession of copyrighted
material, and issues of proprietary license began to be heard
in federal court.  But, the arrests and seizures haven't
seemed to disrupt or discourage the new breed of hackers.

October, 1992 brought the report of an arrest of a 23 year
old Newark, NJ man, identified only as "Maverick" by press
reports.  "Maverick" reportedly was arrested in an
investigation involving disruption of the 911 telephone
service in the New York area.  Two other arrests are expected
soon of teenagers who may have also participated in the plot.
"Maverick" reportedly has been described by unofficial
sources as being a member of a cyberpunk group called the
`Legion of Doom'.  The "Legion" has been identified by
various law enforcement agencies as a prime source of illegal
information and activity.

Concurrently, Toronto, Canada police reportedly have arrested
a fifteen (15) year old boy who is charged with misdirecting
emergency medical service (EMS) crews and calling in false
medical calls by home computer modem.  More interesting, are
the charges that the youth routed his calls through telephone
exchanges in the United States to confuse telephone security
tracking systems. According to Toronto police sources, they
believe that the boy was also involved in a group of
cyberpunks, who were using 911 telephone systems as a
"prank".  Toronto police say that this prank could
potentially cost someone's life, if essential EMS crews were
duped into responding to false calls, while someone actually
needed medical care.

Not as ominous, but surely just as unlawful, was the recent
(Nov., 1992) arrest of three (3) teenagers in Brooksville,
FL.  The high school honor students have been accused of
making tens of thousands of dollars worth of long distance
phone calls.  Reportedly, the group had used a home computer
to tap into the private company's private branch exchanges
(PBXs) and Southeastern Bell telephone lines to correspond
and exchange computer information across the country.
According to press reports, a single company lost more than
$35,000 worth of phone calls.

Some science and computer writers seem to show a certain
commiseration with the cyberpunks, and even suggest that they
could be a positive force for resisting "global oppression of
the masses" by monitoring governments and multi-national
corporations and dispensing `politically incorrect' secrets
to the exposure of the media.  Others report the vast
capability of cyberpunks to cause the "electronic
destruction" of computer systems used for national defense,
banking, communications, nuclear power, transportation, and
other vital services.  At least one unidentified cyberpunk
has been quoted by as saying that, "with current level of
knowledge and the way computer networks are structured, we
have the capability to shut down everything . . . not just
locally...but globally".

Are cyberpunks a force for good or evil . . .  or merely an
extension of an emerging pop subculture that is using the
advanced, available, technology to express a point of view?
Fueled by movies such as THE TERMINATOR, ROBOCOP, and
BLADERUNNER, cyberpunks seem a natural futuristic
extension of the rebellion that is youth.  The major question
that is remaining is whether the cyberpunks will lead
us to freedom of expression and understanding . . . or to the
destruction of society as we know it.
