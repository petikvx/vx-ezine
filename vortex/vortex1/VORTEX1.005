                          Viruses and Trojans


    I won't go into a lengthy discussion about what Viruses and Trojans
    are, I expect you already know this. Hopefully you are to the point
    where you can write your own, if not I have furnished you with a
    couple in this issue of the VORTEX. However you should strive to
    program your own. Trojans are especially easy to write. In a future
    issue I will go more into the writing of trojans and virii however
    for the mean time we will just focus of the distribution and packaging
    of both Viruses and Trojans.


IF YOU DO THAT AGAIN WHEN I BEND OVER TO GET THE SOAP,
I'M GOING TO BE REALLY MAD
   -MIKE TYSON PRISON SAGA

                    PART ONE: SCOPING OUT SECURITY

    Generally before I even think about creation I will log on a few
    BBS's in my area and set up false accounts. I pay careful attention
    to setting up these false accounts, and I make lists of the BBS's
    security. Generally some of the things I look for is the presence
    or absence of a call back verifier, whether or not the BBS will allow
    uploaded files to be immediately put online, and if files uploaded
    are checked for viruses, and if so what virus checking program they
    are using. Now, any security can be bypassed, it all depends on how
    much you want to work on it. Generally though, most BBS will allow you
    to upload files, even if you are not verified. The ideal BBS is one
    that will allow you to upload files without call back verification
    and allows uploaded files for immediate download.

WHO SAID I HAD TO KISS YOU?
    -J. MCAFEE

    Now, if a system does have a call back verifier, it makes it harder
    to get infected files to them. If you really, really want to get
    someone all you have to do is biege your lap top and either go plug
    in at a pay phone, or you can biege into a apartment complexes phones.
    This allows you to successfully get past their call back verifier, but it
    is a royal pain in the butt. A method that is a hell of a lot less
    trouble is taking a user list from a local BBS (like your own) and
    calling the target BBS using the names and passwords in the user.bbs
    Most users use the same password on every BBS, and sooner or later you
    will find one that is the same on each BBS. Heck I usually go hack
    out a few Telegard BBS's (I will teach you to hack a Telejunk BBS
    in a future issue of the Vortex) to provide me with multi user.bbs.
    It is especially nice if you don't like the user whose name you are
    using :) Uploading a virus or trojan to a target BBS in his name
    doesn't help his popularity very much.

                         TROJAN AND VIRUS STRATEGY

    Generally if I am going to hit someone with a virus I just download
    a hot piece of software (that just has come out), infect the file(s)
    and spread it around. Now infecting a file is no fun if you are going
    to infect yourself in the process, so to avoid this the best strategy
    is to put the virus, with the file you want to infect, on your floppy
    drive (it should go without saying don't have anything on this floppy
    that you cant live without). To make sure the virus does not get onto
    your HD type the following for all your drives:

        SUBST X: A:\  (with X being the letter of your HD and A: being
        your floppy.

    This will reassign the path of your drives to your floppy and will
    not let the virus spread to your system. Run the virus and watch the
    lite on your drive and listen to see if the virus is writing to the
    target file. It is a good idea to run the virus several times, to
    make sure it will infect the target file (not all viruses infect
    every time they are run, it also pays to know as much as you can
    about the virus you are using). The virus now has infected the file,
    zip it back up and send it out.

    Trojans are more work, but more fun as well. First of, almost anyone
    can write a trojan. However, if you can't write one, pick one up
    from your local Vx BBS. Now packaging trojans is a art form. In
    "packaging" a trojan you take the little nasty, and then name it
    something that your target is going to want to run. It is very
    important that you make the trojan believable, write docs for it
    and since most trojans are between 200-300 k you need to resize
    it to make it look right. Picking up Nowhere Man's Utilities from
    your local Vx BBS is very important in this. In addition to a resize
    program it has a program for changing the date and all sorts of
    other helpful programs. No self respecting technopath can be caught
    without Nowhere Man's Util's. My most successful trojan was a two
    fold trojan. It was 286to386 & 386to486 it claimed to increase
    the speed on your computer. If you can a 286 it would make it
    operate like and 286, a 386 to a 486. You have no idea how many
    people were stupid enough to fall for this, 30 or 40 last I heard,
    and no telling how many people who are too ashamed to admit it :)
    Packaging a successful trojan is a ART FORM! Remember make it where
    you almost want to run it yourself!


                        BEATING VIRUS SCANNERS



    Okay, a down and dirty (and easy method) to  get  any  virus
    past a virus scanner is to Pklite (or Lzexe) it. Doing this is
    very simple. Take your virus or trojan (if you are using a virus do
    this to the already infected file, because once the file is run
    it will lose it's compression and the virus scanner will then be
    able to detect it) and run Pklite on it (note: small files may
    have to be resized before Pklite can affect them). After you have
    Pklited the file put it into your hex editor, you will see something
    like this:

                                  Disk Editor

    Now the Pklite header is the part of the file that will tell the
    scanner that the file is compressed. If you overwrite the header
    (the part that says "Pklite Copr. 1992 Pkware Inc. All Rights Reserved
    Not enough memory) then the scanner will not be able to detect the
    virus or trojan. Be sure and not overwrite the "$" symbol. So when
    you get through with the overwritten file it will look like this:

    If you don't want to go to all the trouble of over writing the Pklite
    header yourself, pick up Nowhere Man's Utilities and he has a utility
    that does it automatically.
