                      CYBERSPACE VS THE SILICON VORTEX

     It was William Gibson, that fine author of fiction that gave us
    the term "CYBERSPACE". "CYBERSPACE", (though personally I have
     never liked that term) is the interdimensional matrix of data
    bases  as  they  are  networked, brought together  through
     the boorish miracle of modern technology. In the hypothetical
    world of CYBERSPACE an individual PC with it's data base is the
     smallest unit of the matrix, united to the whole through the
    paths of communication. Corporations with their lans and their
     file servers are bigger units. Big corporations being gigantic
    monoliths of information, the bigger the corp the bigger data base,
     the greater the importance to the matrix. Make no mistake, every CPU
    on the planet is linked to every other CPU in one way or another.

     Security (or ICE) is the constricting force of Cyberspace, data
    bases are seemingly safe guarded from prying eyes and fingers through
     electronic security, black ice(?), call back verification and a myriad
    other ways. The lines of communication (mostly though the lines of that
    wonderful invention of Saint Bell, that we call the phone) make up the
     exoskeleton of this world inside a world. Nets exist to further the
    communication of the small units, making these units part of a large
     data structure within the matrix: fidonet, Internet, USAnet, AssholeNET,
    Adultlinks, and Worldnet. Information for good or bad is the bottom
     line in CYBERSPACE, and everyone that is intelligent is attempting to
   obtain more...

     Now here is where the myth  of CYBERSPACE  breaks down. Outer Space for
   all it's vastness has rules, laws, and order. For all its dark empty-
     ness, space is governed by the terms of physics. CYBERSPACE is not. This
   is why The SILICON VORTEX is a much more descriptive term to describe
     this informational matrix. The VORTEX has no political boundaries, the
   matrix crosses these borders and makes them non-existent. Borders,
     countries, laws, mean nothing to the SILICON VORTEX. The VORTEX is larger
   and beyond such contraints. Technology gives us great flux, constants
     are rare. Certainly there are pockets of resistance where make believe
   demigods believe they are in control, however the true nature of the
     VORTEX is anarchy. Aliester Crowley could never have even dreamed of the
   VORTEX, but still he defined the only constant of it: DO WHAT THOU
     WILT SHALL BE THE WHOLE OF THE LAW (side note: don't get caught). To
   imagine restrictions is foolish.


"ARGUE FOR YOUR RESTRICTIONS, AND SURE ENOUGH, THEY ARE YOURS"
  -J.L. Seagull


   Octave Mirbeau described the whole world as "The Torture Garden", Ann
 Rice called it "The Savage Garden". The VORTEX is this and more, inside
   this medium there is only continued flux, the pursuit of information,
 and joyful destruction. Steven Donaldson's Despiser is our only god
   and anarchy is our only goal.

                       CYBERPUNK VS TECHNOPATH


   Cyberpunk is the term that Gibson gave that highly technical
     group of phreakers\hackers in his hi-tech fictional world.
   Now if you think I disliked the term Cyberspace, you ought to
     here my opinion on Cyberpunk. Man a punk is somebody who bends
   over and takes it up the ass. If that's what you feel like you
     are then fine, power to you. Feel free to call yourself a punk,
   that is fine by me, however personally I have always liked the
     term that Vesselin Bontchev (a much over rated virus researcher)
   gave the Dark Avenger. In one of his extremely boorish papers
     he called DA a "Technopath". I like the term. Thanks
   Vesselin, you old cock sucker, we know you really write viruses,
     yes we do. Perhaps you can hide your true nature from the world,
   but from not us, your brothers in destruction.

  -PROVERBS OF MUAD'DIB

     There are many ways to obtain godhood in The SILICON VORTEX, however
   if you can leave the false worldly constrains of ethics and morals
    behind I can give you the ability to manipulate the environment of
   the VORTEX, to become a sorcerer of silicon. Creation is always nice,
    but true power rests in the power to destroy. Even in the MEAT world
   we live in this is so, the United States has the greatest power to
    destroy, therefore we are the greatest nation. Creation of destruction
   inside the VORTEX is a art form.  The  true  Technopath is a artist
    whose true power comes from within. Information is a tool the artist
   uses. The information contained within this journal and the others
    doubtlessly to follow will give you the ability to tap into that dark
   side of yourself that likes to cause anarchy. True artistry comes from
    creativity. The tougher the security to crack the better the game. The
   greater the risk the greater the high and everyone inside the VORTEX is
    playing the game.. just some of them are the prey. When you cross the
   line, your desire to create the anarchy of destruction will become
    all most all consuming. Like a junkie searching for a vein you will
   crave bigger and better destruction. True gratification comes in the
    creative and stylish destruction of others data base inside the VORTEX.
   True joy is the destruction itself.


AND NOW HERE'S SOMETHING YOU'LL REALLY LIKE...
   -ROCKEY THE SQUIRREL

   So inside these VORTEX journals I will teach you how to creatively
     destroy, I will guide you, but your true guide will be your own
   creativity and originality. You are limited only by your imagination
     inside the VORTEX, your manipulation is only held back by this
   and your knowledge. Learn how to program the VORTEX and your
     technopathic ability will grow by leaps and bounds.
