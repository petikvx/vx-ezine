                    VIRUS TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

  APPENDING - A appending virus appends itself onto the end of
the host program, usually it will edit the beginning of the
  host program as well. Now a infected program should function
normally and when executed it will first run the virus and then
  go back and run the host program itself. After infection there
will be a increase in size in the host program equal to the size
  of the virus. A CRC checking Anti-virus program can pick this up.
"Smart" appending viruses also put a "marker" upon the host program
  so it can not be infected again  by the virus.

DISK INFECTORS - Disk Infectors are viruses that infect the boot
sector. The boot sector is the part of a hard disk (or floppy)
that is executed each time you boot up. When the system boots
up a disk infector will usually become active by going resident
(see resident or TSR viruses). Master Boot viruses (MBV's) are
viruses which infect the Master Boot Record on fixed disks and
the DOS boot sector on diskettes.

LOGIC BOMB - A logic bomb is similar to a trojan except that it
does not execute on its own. Generally a logic bomb is a .obj
file that is linked to another program. When a certain set of
conditions are met the logic bomb will go off. This has the
advantage of letting the program function normally until set
conditions are met. These things are gems, for instance say
you set a logic bomb to go off after August 12. Okay, now
if that person has had this logic bomb on his system for a
while it will be in his backups. Therefore even after he restores
it goes off again as soon as that program is run. Neat huh?

OVERWRITING VIRUS - A Overwriting Virus is a virus copies itself
over the beginning of the host program. So "overwriting" refers to
the way the virus infects. The infected file is generally destroyed
and will usually not run, which of course will cause user suspicion.
To combat this it is necessary to add a fake error message that
will be displayed every time the file is run, randomly chosen messages
are the most effective. One good feature of the overwriting virus is
that it causes no CRC changes therefore a CRC checker will not detect it.
A overwriting virus can never be cleaned by a virus clean program,
it must be restored from backup.

TROJANS - A Trojan is a programed named for the legendary "trojan
horse" used against Troy by the Greeks. A Trojan is a non-replicating
program (a trojan is not a virus, referring to it as such makes you
look like a moron). A properly made trojan is best disguised as
new versions of shareware, virus scanners, or perhaps commercial
software such as games. A trojan appears normal until the program
is run, when it formats the hard drive or does something nasty to
the moron that ran it.

TSR or RESIDENT VIRUSES -  A resident virus hides itself 
somewhere in memory the first time an infected program is
executed, and thereafter infects other programs when they are
executed (as in the case of the Jerusalem) or when certain other
conditions are fulfilled. 

SPAWNING VIRUSES - A Spawning or companion virus works on the principle that,
given the same file name, DOS will execute an COM program before an EXE
(given that both programs share the same name). A Spawning virus will
produce a hidden COM file that is a companion too the EXE, it runs instead
of the EXE file. None of the code in the original file is changed, this makes
it impossible for CRC based scanners to detect it.

VIRULENCE - Virulence is how many new files a virus will infect each
time it is run.

VIRUS - According to Dr. Cohen a computer virus is a program that can 
infect other computer programs by modifying them in such a way as to
include a copy of itself. This virus does not have to preform outright
damage to be considered a virus. Generally however most people consider
viruses destructive.
