      NOT TO BE USED FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES!!!!!! :)


     A_N_U_L requires the following to operate:

     o    an 80286 processor or better
     o    512k or more of free memory
     o    MS-DOS v3.0 or higher (v4.0 or higher recommended)


  ANUL will call a BBS repeatedly and log on as a new user, using a random
 string of bytes for the new user name/handle (as the system you are dialing
  permits, see: script file defs).  What is the point of that?  If you can't
        figure that out, you have no business reading this file.

if your modem isn't on COM1 or COM2, forget it, this won't work for you.

First off, you have to do some work, yes work.  You need to call the target
BBS (preferably someone who is a real bastard anyway), and keep track of:

                    time between necessary keystrokes
                               keystrokes

write all that stuff down, and then you get to work on the script file.  After
you have done the work, then it is very easy to activate.  
                                 ANUL -scriptfile
And that's it.  You can run it as a timed event, if you run a BBS yourself.

One more thing---it uses the console output for whatever comes in through the
modem, 3 reasons, 

one---can't get an ANSI bomb this way.   
two---keeps the stat screen looking good.
three--- I am too fucking lazy to make an ANSI decode scheme, useless anyway.

^^^^^--all that means ANSI shit will look funny, ignore it.

script file defs=

The script file is an amazingly normal one with a few enhancements.  You have
a couple control characters available at your disposal.

LINE 1 MUST BE COMPORT (as bios sees it, if you have a PS/2 mouse, you may
        really be on COM2, but bios sees it as COM1)
LINE 2 MUST BE # OF PASSES  (1-32000 or so acceptable)


!xx    Pause for xx seconds (0-59 acceptable)
$      Send +++ to modem to init, with appropriate 2sec guard times
#xxxx  Generate and send a random string of bytes, xx characters in length.
       (1-32000 acceptable)
^      Sends through an ASCII 13 (C/R)
*      Sends through an ASCII 27 (ESC)
~      Type this from the main screen to exit the program

%<filename> Will send a text file through the modem to your target (good for
            generic EAT SHIT new user letters.
  
A line beginning with anything else will just be sent through the modem as
a string of bytes. 
                                        
For more information, see the example EXAMPLE.SCR included in this archive,
it will log onto a Renegade BBS with FrontDoor.  It is further explained, 
linebyline in EXAMPLE.EXP.  This will need to be modified to work with any
particular BBS, if you can't handle it, or think it is too hard, you don't
want to piss off someone very much.
