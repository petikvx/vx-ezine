General description of the Nexiv_Der:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
The Nexiv_Der virus (which reversed name results Red_Vixen) is a TSR,
polymorphic, COM+Floppy_Boot+Hard_Disk_Boot-infector, stealth. The main
characteristic of this virus is certainly the possibility to infect a COM
file without changing in any way the entry point. Infact the file infection
is done using a complex procedure, that i'll explain later, which insert a
call to the virus in a random position of the file.
This capability, added to the polymorphism of the virus, makes the search
for it very hard, and for some less sophisticate antiviruses even
impossible.
Unfortunately the mutation engine isn't perfect, contrary frequently it
generate code that causes the pc to crash during a file infection.

How it works:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßß
When the virus is executed it will check if it started from a file or from
a Boot Sector. If the virus isn't already active in memory it will try
to infect the Boot Sector of the drive C, located at the Cylinder 0 / Side
1 / Sector 1.
After this operation, if the execution has been done from a file, the virus
will continue the execution of the host without doing anything else.
Otherwise, if the execution has been done from the Boot, the virus will
install itself in memory.
The memory installation is done with a normal hook of the Int 13h vector,
the needed memory is allocated decrementing the word at 40h:13h, that
contains the avaiable memory dimension in K (usually 640).
The routine of the Int 13h handler doesn't only hide the virus presence and
infect the Floppy Boot, but it is also used to hook the Int 21h once that
DOS has been totally loaded.
In detail, the routine waits for 3 sectors which contain as the first two
bytes 'MZ' are read. It is presumable that after the execution of 3 EXE
the DOS is now already installed in memory.
The Int 21h handler will handle the file infection, of course.


File infection:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
The infection routine is executed when a COM file is executed and is at
least 1000 but not more than 55000 bytes long.
Each file can be infected up to 3 times. This is done to avoid that the
virus will infect a file location that isn't executed frequently.
The number of file infections is stored as the number of the seconds of the
file: 5 = one infection, 6 = two infections, 7 = three infections, all the
other values = no infections done.
After this controls the virus passes to the real infection.
Once that the file is opened it reads the first 32 byte, and hooks the
Int 13h, the Int 3 and leaves DOS to execute the file normally.
To execute the file DOS must read it from the disk where the file is
located, using therefore the Int 13h.
And that is why the virus hooked the Int 13h! That's because the routine
can check when the first sector of the file is being readed, operation that
is done by comparing the first 32 byte with the 32 read precedently.
When the first sector of the file is determinated, the first byte in the
memory image is substituted with a 0CCh, which is just an Int 3.
After this the Int 13h handler is disabled, so there wouldn't be any
possibility that another Int 3 may be inserted.
When the DOS has finished to read the entire file it executes the file,
calling in this way the Int 3.
The virus by intercepting the Int 3 understands that the execution of the
file has started and so it restores the first byte of the file in the
memory and then it activate the virus tracer hooking it at the Int 1. Now
the file is executed step-by-step.
The virus also fills the part of memory just under the end of the file
in memory with a standard byte, which use will be explained later.
The step-by-step execution is a method to make the microprocessor
execute an Int 1 after each instruction. But i won't talk too much
about this. Maybe another day :)
The tracer hooked to the Int 1 waits that a random number between 256 and
1279 instructions of the file has been executed. Once that the selected
number of instructions has been executed, the tracer will continue in the
same way to execute the step-by-step mode, but it will search for an
instruction that is a CALL (0E8h,x,x), or a JMP (0E9h,x,x) or also a
ADD/SUB/CMP/XOR of a byte with a byte register, like for example the
instruction 'CMP CL,12h' (80h,0Cxh,x).
Note that all of this instructions are long exactly 3 byte, infact the
call to the virus that will be insterted is a CALL, which is long 3 byte.
Notice also that it isn't rare that are produced multiple infections which
are fully functional where the selected instruction is an instruction of
the polymorphic code of another precedent infection.
Selected a suitable instruction, the virus will search for a memory part
after the tail of the file that hasn't been modified by the host.
This check is done by searching a part of memory where a sufficent number
of contiguous standard bytes where left untouched. Here will be inserted
the body of the virus.
When the needed memory is found the virus is finally ready to start the
real file infection.
There is also a last check: it verifyes if effectively the selected
instruction is still at the selected position in the file.
If the file is compressed with PKLite, LZExe or Diet, or the file is
encrypted then the virus won't infect the file to prevent the damage of the
file.
At this point the virus unhooks the tracer from the Int 1, infects the file
and leaves the program to continue its work.
When the program terminates his execution the virus will unhook again the
tracer from Int 1, Int 3 and Int 13h. This is done to prevent some vectors
to remain still hooked after the termination of the file execution.
This may succed when the file isn't read using the Int 13h or when the
tracer is brutally disabled during the host execution.

Highlights of this method of COM infection:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
- For an antivirus the check for an infection is really hard.
- The virus may be also activated just in some cases when a determinate
  part of code is executed.
  Example: during my study of this virus an infection of the DOS program
  DISKCOPY.COM i noticed that when i started the program normally the
  virus doesn't activate, but it get activated just when i tried to
  copy a diskette (DISKCOPY A: A:)
- The entry point of the host is unchanged, so the check of some intergity
  verifyers and antiviruses is useless.

Defects of this method of COM infection:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
- Not all the COM files can be infected, the compressed and encrypted ones
  infact can't.
- The plain and uncompressed files that contains antidebugging code may
  cause a crash of the PC during its infection.
  This because the virus tracing uses the Int 1 and the file may change the
  Int 1 vector one word at once (mov [4],1234h)
- Only files that are on floppy disks and hard disk may be infected. To be
  more precise only files that are accessed using Int 13h can be infected.
  On remote or virtual disks the infection can't happen.

Hard Disk's Boot Sector infection:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
The infection of the Hard Disk is done in a more complex way than many
other multipartite viruses. This is due to the fact that the virus is
polymorphic also on the boot sector.
The virus reads the Boot Sector of the first partition of the first Hard
Disk that is located on Cylinder 0 / Side 1 / Sector 1 and checks if this
has been already infected.
This is done by checking if the second byte of the sector is equal to 'E'.
If it isn't already infected the Boot is partially overwritten by a
polymorphic loader, which will load and execute the body of the virus at
the Boot from the Hard Disk.
The original boot is saved at the location Cylinder 0 / Side 0 / Sector 6
and just after this, at the location Cylinder 0 / Side 0 / Sector 7, the
polymorphic body of the virus will be saved.

Highlights of this method of Hard Disk's Boot Sector infection:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
- The infection procedure doesn't apply any change to the MBR, so it
  won't worry any antivirus protections of the AMI and Award BIOSes.

Defects of this method of Hard Disks's Boot Sector infection:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
- None

Floppy Boot Sector infection:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
The infection of the Boot Sector of the Floppy is easyer than the Hard
Disk one.
When the DOS will try to read the Floppy Boot Sector the virus will check
if it has been already infected.
This is done by checking if the second byte of the sector is equal to 'E'
If it isn't, the Boot is infected by overwriting the first
part of it with a polymorphic loader which will load and execute the virus
body at a Boot from the Floppy.
The original Boot Sector is stored at the location Cylinder 79 / Side 1 /
Sector 1 and just after this, at the position Cylinder 79 / Side 1 /
Sector 2, the virus body will be saved.
Notice that the polymorphic body of the virus isn't created at virus
runtime but is just copied from the Hard Disk infection.

Highlights of this method of Floppy's Boot Sector infection:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
- None

Defects of this method of Floppy's Boot Sector infection:
ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
- The virus is quite long and risks to be overwritten on the Floppy
  disks that will be quite completely filled (for example with a backup or
  with an ARJ or ZIP in backup mode)
- Only 1.44M Floppyes are infected
