% An Introduction to IRG - by IRG %
___________________________________

On Friday, the 13th of September, 1996, the groups Immortal Riot and Genesis
came to an end, and the super group Immortal Riot/Genesis (IRG) was born. I
think most people reading the magazine will be familiar with Immortal Riot,
but Genesis might need some introduction. Genesis are ( were, I guess ) an
excellent, upcoming virus group. Perhaps their fatal flaw was the fact that
they were so busy coding, they never got around to releasing anything ( or
perhaps they were just lazy like IR? ). Immortal Riot on the other hand had
Insane Reality magazine to release all their source, but as they only had a
hand full of active good coders, there was not much to release. Considering
this, the merge seemed the logical thing to do since the two groups seem to
compliment each other so well. This merge bought us quite a large number of
members (16), and a group spanning 4 countries - Sweden, Australia, the U.K,
and the U.S.A.

It should be noted that some contributions to this magazine were written
before the merge, and hence contain references to Immortal Riot or Genesis as
seperate entities. Also IR zine stands for Insane Reality _NOT_ Immortal Riot
thats just coincidental. The groups name has changed, but the magazine's name
hasn't.

IRG have no official leader, but things are generaly organised by Rajaat,
The Unforgiven, or myself (Sepultura). But enough from me, lets go to The
Unforgiven and Rajaat.

% My view's why a merge became reality %
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A new merge between two groups somewhere in the end of 1996 may
seem weird to some. With arguments like "competition makes better
viruses" or "many members results in lazy members" it does indeed
seem like a weird decision to take. 

Maybe we do 1) wan't to be lazy. 2) Want no competition. 
But it's up to you if you want to believe those things. We 
did plan something else. Something better.

What we planned and what was going on inside our brains was this,
which also are the real reason to the merge. Genesis is a group
which has a shitload of truely amazing coders, but their problem
was that they wouldn't get their ass of to release their little
evil software. They did a lot but never did release shits to
the major public. If you know their members, surely you have
recieved private code from their members. Well, atleast *I* did for
quite some time.

Immortal Riot on the other side had a few good coders, most of them
really lazy though yet fully capable of releasing a zine or a virus 
once in a while. Occasionally we did actually release some material
and that was when when we had enough material to release. Ready or
not we did realease it. Our main problem was to get good material to
release. Consider everyone all sudden got really lazy, Immortal Riot has
been more or less dead the last years. We'd like to fix that. But how?
The merge, of course! 

The merge would get us (immortal riot) more material. More good material and 
more interesting stuff to release. So, the deal would go something like
this ;). Genesis would produce like shits and we would release their
material in the combined name "Immortal Riot/Genesis". Heh an easy
way to be credited methinks :-). 

I won't go into the reasons why Rajaat found a merge great he'll probably 
give you his thoughts concerning this in this article as well. The only really
important thing is just that there are no abuse from anyone's side. Surely 
when I said I would take credit for their work above I was joking.

Now we can hope this merge was a good decision to take. If you like this
zine, you can except a better next one. Our members roles aren't exactly
clear but most of us are coders, article writers while some are taking
care of the distrubution/spreading. In vlad#7 I was mentioned as our leader
together with Rajaat. Don't believe anything you read in your local
magazine ;) all I used to do was organize Immortal Riot. My position now
could perhaps be described as co-ordinator in the swedish sector, if anything.

Take care folks. The world will hear from me again...

% The Genesis of a new group, Insane or Reality? %

As you are reading this magazine, the merge may seem a little bit strange
to some people. I know The Unforgiven has commented the situation on his
part, but I'd like to comment my views too. Some people may have read my
interview with The Unforgiven, stating I don't like to be in a group. A few
months later Genesis was formed... Why?
The reason is very simple, I'm a virus coder. When I'm finished writing my
code, I don't know what to do with it. It is crazy to make a disk magazine
only for my own stuff, like Virogen did. Such magazine won't travel very
far, because his name is not that well known, only to insiders. This is the
main reason for my why I started Genesis at first, to have an expertized
group, that could discuss things amonst eachother, without leaking beta
versions of code to the outside world (I know this even happened one IN a
group, hi Quantum!). We would exchange ideas, program individually, and
release the whole pack as a disk magazine. Unfortunately we are not such
working in a very high profile, and we wanted to release a magazine in
december 1995 already. It never came to that. Most members were busy, and in 
this whole year I only released about 4 or 5 things. Two sources I contributed 
to PLASMA, but DC also has ceased to exist.

I already heard Vlad was having a near-death experience, so I had to think
of something to keep the scene alive... Then Immortal Riot entered the
stage and after having various discussions with Sepultura I came to the
idea to release our code together. Lucky enough he (and The Unforgiven)
thought this was a great idea, since they also had inactive members, little
or no free time at all to make viruses and other situations that caused the
delay on IR#8. We now have combined our efforts to (hopefully) release this
new magazine, the fruits of our joint-venture.
