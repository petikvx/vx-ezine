Here's an article discussing how to get the AV to name your viruses what you
want.. not much more I can say.

 % How to creatively name your virus? %

 One of the hardest things in virus writing is giving the virus its name.
 When you have a solid idea converted to code, have written it and
 tested it toroughly you have to think of something that you can identify
 it again when you see it showing up in the scanners and the newsgroups.
 The more viruses appear, the more difficult it is to think of yet
 another catchy name for your virus. I hope to present you some ideas
 here how to give your virus a name, where you can recognize it from
 when it gets in the wild.

 % Virus author confused with virus name %

 The thing that happens most is that virus researchers are going to group
 the viruses one author has written and next assign then numbers of
 their size. I can't think for a reason of this, probably because they
 will have problems using the Caro Naming Convention if they use these
 virus names. That's the only reason I can think of when they dubbed
 Andropinis to Rajaat.518. I'd rather hoped they would call it
 Rajaat.Andropinis. The thing you can do to twart their ideas, is the
 following:

 Make your virus so that, if it activates, only displays the name of the
 virus, and not the author. The author string can be embedded in the
 code, but should not be written out to the screen. The insiders will
 recognize your name, the victims often not. Don't make the name of the
 virus too long. By this action, researchers are almost forced to use
 the name of the virus to identify it, because the end users that will
 see the activation will most often search for that name in the virus
 encyclopedias.

 % Make the activation catchy %

 One other thing you should to is trying to implement a payload that
 will be remembered by the user. Falling letters on your screen hardly
 will raise and eyebrow or two, but a mandelbrot figure, a nice
 character animation (look at Diametric/Matricide for an example),
 some high pitched noise (accompanied with subtle screen shakes) or
 strange messages on a Novell file server will do just fine in the sight
 of an ordinary end-user. This graphic payload does not indicate that
 you virus can not be destructive. You could erase random sectors with
 every note the virus plays of the Nutcracker Suite. Just remember to be
 creative. Let the virus overwrite the MSDOS icon to an upwards pointing
 middle-finger. Let your fantasy go wild, I expect to see fruits soon
 ;-)

 % Think of a good name %

 If your virus was fun to make, you wouldn't dare to let it wreak havoc
 without having you assigned a good name to it yet. Too choose names,
 you can let yourself get inspired with everyday life around you. Name
 if after that long legged chick running loose in your college. Dub it
 like your favorite (ehum?) politician. Call it like a pop star, or add a
 few lines of a songtext. Give it at least one word that will jump out
 of context, it will most probably the chosen word for identifying your
 virus. "Hello, I'm your new pal." won't do it, or you should have
 concatenated the last two words by mistake because then it will be
 called the Newpal virus, without doubt! Try catchy lines like:

                            I'm NEUROMANCER!
             Spell my name right, it's Tarzan, not Trazan!

 The worst case scenario is that researchers will choose Trazan as name
 instead of the hoped NEUROMANCER. Should you remove the ", not Trazan"
 part it will most probably appear in the wildlist as NEUROMANCER, with
 a 5% chance that your name will be added to it, if there is already a
 neuromancer virus that has got nothing to do with this one.

 % Encrypt all other strings %

 If you know the story of the Girafe virus, you know it's a Coffeeshop
 virus variant that uses a beta version of the TridenT Polymorphic
 Engine (TPE). But when the virus was decrypted, you could see numerous
 readable words, each pair of characters being the first two characters
 of certain files the virus avoids infecting. The writer of the virus
 didn't want to infect Gobbler II (GII.EXE), Remote Access (RA.EXE), and
 FastEcho (FECHO.EXE) (I assume he meant these files), this constructing
 the GIRAFE string. Other strings in the virus were the TPE marker and
 the initials of the author. One way to avoid these mistakes is to
 encrypt all the strings that must not be plainly visible. Priest has
 understood this trick, and very often encrypted string with an XOR in
 his viruses. Don't use initials in your virus, since a 'RG' is as large
 as an 'MZ' and won't be used. 'PS' could mean 'Phalcon/Skism', but also
 be a PUSH AX & PUSH BX opcode.

 % Make the name a remembrance %

 To ensure that everyone knows the name of the virus and your handle,
 you can make it known to them the very hard way. If your virus will
 destroy the contents of someones harddisk, then make it so that the
 user only will see the name of your virus on his screen during a dir
 command. Thinks of this: all your files gone and the volume on your
 harddisk is now "Rajaat haha", you will never forget who did this to
 you. Never. One of the virus names that are even known to non-virus
 related people is Michelangelo, a rather unremarkable virus, but is
 known for it's destructive actions performed on March the 6th. The
 virus recieved its name from the researchers and didn't contain a name.
 If it had a name in its code, it surely would have been called by that
 namen, even though it's a lame variant of the Stoned virus.

 % Don't use complex names %

 Don't use complex names in your virus, because people won't be able to
 remember the name very well. Never call it something like Breeblebrox,
 as it's a complex name to remember if you are not familiar with The
 Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Give the virus a name that most people
 will recognize or have a simple lexical structure. Hamanu is a simple
 name, even when people won't recognize the name as being a character (a
 Sorcerer King, to be more exactly) in the Dark Sun books, a series of
 novels brought out by T$R. It's is the same series of books I used to
 give myself a name (I'd be a blunted idiot if I'd use my real name,
 won't I?) and my MBR/COM infector (Andropinis, a bit tougher to
 remember). Rajaat is an easy name to remember, as it has no complex
 lexical structure. Names that are suitable are words like Maverick,
 Goldfinger, Witchboard, TopCat and Jetsons, as they all represent
 common movie names, cartoon figures or items that are well known. Don't
 assign a name to your virus like Prerequisite, Conquistador or
 Alapalooza. Name that are suitable are everlasting by their infamousy.
 Don't choose a name that will anger people, as that name won't be used.
 There are a few viruses that have the name Hitler, but researchers will
 shun that name. Ripper is an excellent example, as Jack the Ripper is a
 name that rings a bell at many people, and won't hurt anyone since it's
 so long ago that Jack roamed the dark streets of London.

 % Don't use names of people %

 Researchers won't name your virus the way you want it if it's a name of
 some person. An example is the Klaeren virus, which is now called
 different. Klaeren was a real name, and the person had nothing to do
 with the virus its creation. Better use fictive names that are not too
 real sounding. Think of names like Frodo, Sauron, Gallard, King Tec,
 Zaphod or Egami (Image reversed). Reversed names also are very suitable
 for viruses, like Natas and Nexiv_der.

 % Use a name that represents actuality %

 We virus writers are viewed upon as old-fashioned, and even if there
 are numerous WordBasic viruses, we mostly enjoy writing our viruses in
 assembler, whereas the researchers have first-class tools to their
 disposal. To let them show we react on recent news, you can best assign
 a name to your virus that shows it actuality. Call your virus Camilla,
 Pile of Shit (that stings!), Booza (drinking too much booze like boza
 will end up in names like these) or Setab (Bates reversed, I don't like
 this Jim Bates person at all, as do all virus writers down here). To
 regular MTV watchers I suggest Cornholio as the perfect virus name ;-)

 % Don't stress the name of the virus %

 Don't stress the fact that a virus is called a certain way by you. We
 have seen this with the Bizatch virus, now better known as Boza. Since
 Quantum actually almost PLEADED to have the virus called Bizatch, the
 researchers called it Boza, just in spite. If I even DARE to add a
 string in Diametric/Matricide that is even remotely saying something
 like "You little fuckheads, call this virus Diametric/Matricide, or
 I'll bash your brains out!" they would most probably call it
 Rajaat.BrainBash or something equally similar. Just make sure that only
 the name is of the virus is easily recognized and additional strings
 must be hidden from the users view.

 % Conclusion %

 You can never FORCE a researcher to name your virus as you wanted it,
 but you can give them a push in the good direction. Reading this
 article is of course not an insurance your virus gets the name you want
 it, but it will certainly be of great help. I am curious myself how
 they will call my Diametric/Matricide virus, since the name mutates
 (that's very easy with a XOR key and an anagram). Maybe they will call
 it the same as I referred to it when the development of it was in beta
 stage (Hamanu was the name). I am afraid I've acquired myself a sort of
 Microsoft image with assigning project names to viruses when they are
 not finished.
