Lots has changed since Insane Reality issue #7. Firstly, several new members
have joined IR - these include Absolute Overlord, DV8, Liquid Jesus, and
myself (Sepultura). After this, we went onto merge with Genesis to form the 
group IRG. More on that in the 'Introduction to IRG' article. Secondly, The 
Unforgiven who has been the editor for the last 7 issues, has handed this 
task over to me. This is due to inactivity as far as I know. Its interesting 
to note that in the last issue of this magazine, The Unforgiven stated:

"My aim is to publish information of any kind which I in one or another way 
find to be interesting, funny to read or in one and another way amuses me. 

This can mean that this zine won't be as virus-oriented as it used to be,
or it might not. Hopefully viruses will continue to facinate me and then
it's also very likely that Insane Reality will be highly focused on computer-
viruses.

However, if you in the future see an IR-zine being released monthly and
contain nearly no virus-related articles and lack virus source code written
by me, don't be suprised. Basicly, I'm a journalist and not a virus writer."

Well, I'm a virus writer and not a journalist, so expect to see more IR-zines
coming out with many hardcore virus related articles, and virus source. At
least while The Unforgiven and the rest of IRG, leave me organising the zine.

Besides an overall increase in the technical quality of the included viruses
and articles, the magazine has had a general facelift. Most significantly,
the magazine now uses a cool new viewer from our friend Dark Fiber. It is 
also a lot more technically orientated. The magazine is about 1.4 meg, of
which about 99% of which is actual articles. Unlike some 'virus' magazines
we dont need 500k viewers / intros / music files to impress.

I'd also like to mention that `Magazine' is the keyword. Our aim is to supply
you, the reader, with all types of interesting virus related material, be it 
new viruses, old viruses, articles, interviews, or even ripped-off AV texts. 
If we were simply going to dump 20 .ASM files in a .ZIP, it would be called a 
code pack. Those who say there's not enough code should remember its quality 
not quantity. Those who still say they want more code should get VCL.

Well, thats all I have to say, except that a lot of effort has gone into 
improving the zine, so we hope you enjoy it. Any feedback can be sent to one
of the E-Mail address listed in the IRG Information section.
