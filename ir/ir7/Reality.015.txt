% Rather Small Virus [RSV] * 3 %

--------------------------------

What follow here is in practical the same virus three times :-). 
It was written by Conzouler ages ago, and it has as well been made 
public. I'm though quite sure some of you havn't seen it, so there 
you go..



Notice that this isn't any advanced way-cool things, but maybe some 
of you find them useful for something, and that's the thought (if there 
ever were any ;)) behind this article :-).

  Three educational viruses to show how to fool debuggers, 
  Invircible and how to perform an "intersegmentary hooking".

  I have planned to do a super-mega-ultimate-awsome virus quite 
  some time, but I just haven't done it.

  That could mean that I am too lazy, maybe. Or that I've been 
  doing some other stuff instead. However, I've done some research 
  (in fact I have done lotsa routines but I haven't put them together 
  in a virus that I'm pleased with yet) and here is three of those 
  routines, two are quite simple but the third is quite interresting. 


  I have put all of these routines on a small virus called RSV or 
  Rather Small Virus. This virus uses com-infect on execute and 
  is resident, it has no other features. It should not be detected 
  by existing scanners.



  The purpose is that you could look at the code and learn how to 
  use this yourself.



  First comes AntiTBC, which uses a prefetch trick.

  AntiTBC - A virus based on RSV that will fool TB-Clean.

  (c) Conzouler / Immortal Riot 1995.



컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

  Theory:



  Debuggers like TB-Clean reads one instruction a time from 
  memory while the processor will read 16 and put them in a 
  prefetch queue. Therefore, if you change code that already 
  is is in the prefetch the change won't affect the program 
  when run normally, but if the program is run with TB-Clean 
  it will run the changed code.

  Any branch (jumps, calls, ints and rets) will flush the

  prefetch and 16 bytes will be read from the new position. 
  So, you can change the location of a jump to make some

  code run if a debugger is used but another when executed 
  normally. Get it?

  The fun part with TB-Clean is that you can use this tech- 
  nique to simulate a program restoration but instead you

  put some mean code instead of the original program.



  You can also just do an int20 when tbscan is executed and 
  make TB-Clean say: "File might not be infected at all or 
  is damaged by an overwriting virus". Which is exactly what 
  TB-Clean would say if the file wasn't infected in the first 
  place.

;  Based on RSV.

;

;  Features:

;  memory resident

;  com-append on execute

;  no tb-flags (of course)

;  no f-prot heuristics

;  fools tbclean (look at the restore routine)

  AntiIVT - A virus based on RSV that will fool IVTEST and IVINIT.

  Theory:



  Invircible test and and init programs use a technique known as 
  "decoy-launching" to detect viruses.



  The decoy-launcher creates a dummy file with a random name and 
  runs it. Then it checks the file to see if  it has changed and 
  if it has, it's been infected.



  Simple, but effective. The major problem is that it only works 
  with resident viruses, and it can't detect them unless you are 
  infected.



  It is easy to fool. This virus just checks if the name of the 
  currently running program begins with IV, and if it does, it 
  won't infect a file. Simple but effective.



  Of course it's easy tool fool this virus, you can just rename 
  IVTEST.EXE. But how many does?



  The routine has other uses too. A possible use for it should be 
  to check if a program named PKxxxxx was running, and disable 
  stealth. This would solve the problem of disinfecting viruses 
  which don't spread because they have so good stealth.

  Tunneler - A virus based on RSV that uses Tunneling to go resident 
  first in the interrupt chain.

  (c) Conzouler / Immortal Riot 1995.

  Theory:



  The normal way to chain an interrupt looks like this:

  Get the address of that interrupt, set the interrupt

  vector to your handler. When your handler has finished,

  do a far jump to the old handler.



  There are only a few common ways of doing this far jump: 
  far direct jump, far immediate jump and the respective

  calls.



  So what this virus does is to single-step through the

  interrupt 21 chain until it finds the opcode for one of

  the above mentioned jumps or calls whose address is lower 
  than the address of the first memory control block.



  If it does, it will change that address to point to the

  virus handler and save the original address.



  Code:



;

;  Tunneler - written by Conzouler/IR 1995

;

;  Based on the Rather Small Virus (refer to RSV.ASM for details). 
;  Tunneling and intersegmentary hooking added.

;  Thanks to TU for supplying ideas and concepts and

;  further credits goes to Satan's little helper!



;  Features:

;  memory resident

;  com-append on execute

;  no tb-flags (of course)

;  tunnels to find dos entry point

;  chains in first in the int21 chain
