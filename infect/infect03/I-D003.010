        In  the  end,  we  decided it would better if we began releasing our
 research viruses  to  anti-virus professionals (bah!).  I  called  Patricia
 Hoffman's board, cringing  at the  thought  of...  Wildcat! (it  just isn't
 right  without  the !). I  construct an  account, promptly  forgetting  the
 password I assigned to it, and, uploaded our old and useless COM infectors.

        After  the gloriously  short upload (9600 is great...), I left Patti
 this little letter...

I have uploaded to you some OLD VG viruses, as we are now doing TSR
COM/EXE infectors. Hopefully, when we move on to boot infectors, we
will remember to upload those here as well.

In the meantime, please send these to whoever does research work for
you, as I'm sure it can't be you, I mean, you don't even know your own
name. 

Anyway, they all have DOC files with them, that are totally correct,
though I may have 'forgot' and left out a couple of features. None of
these viruses are intentionally distructive, just loads and loads of
fun.

Anyway, if you want to be the index of ALL viruses, you better move to
place these in the index, as they are on our support boards, and can be
downloaded and placed active by anyone, though we as a group will not
release viruses into the wild.
 
I thought I had an account on here earlier. Yeesh, I hope you didn't
delete it... anyway, I'd like to ask that you keep my account live, as
I enjoy downloading your fine VSUM publication. VG is too poor to
afford to register it, however. Could we get, maybe, a charity
subscription?

        So... a  few days later, I  note this reply, when I log in to see if
 the new VSUM is out yet...

Well, the only time I don't know my own name is when someone calls the
wrong "Patricia Hoffman" because they got the phone number from
Information or the phone book.  My home phone number is unlisted, but
there are a couple of other Patricia Hoffman's in Silicon Valley as
well.  If you are referring to a certain conference call of about 9-10
months ago when 13 or so young men tried to contact me, they called the
WRONG Patricia Hoffman..... I was at home reading a novel, and didn't
know about the call until McAfee called and asked why I didn't speak to
the "young men".  
 ===========================================================================
        
        Well... interesting...  the truth?  Who knows... I'd kind of like to
 talk to her,  regardless... I just have  nothing that dials alliance, and I
 really would like to share the experience with others...
