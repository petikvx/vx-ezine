                 ============================================ 
                   Personal Rant from The Attitude Adjuster
                      By... err, The Attitude Adjuster
                 ============================================

        Err... yo!

        Welcome  again to  Infectious Diseases,  and we  hope you enjoy this
 as much as you've enjoyed our past productions (right... sure...).

        It has  been a  both discouraging  and illuminating  time since last
 issue's release. I  have raved on FidoNet  more  and more (those of you who
 know me by name can see my great revelations... I have to keep myself under
 control when  I  use my  real name, hopefully  I can  get one  of those Jon
 Johnson type accounts to really allow me to express myself...), and was the
 one who instigated the 'YAM  really did  write it' lie... I guess I've kind
 of  toned down  on my  YAM  bashing,  and even  edited out  most of the bad
 comments about them in my dissassembly of their virus in this issue...

        I was rather  pissed/saddened at the busting of ARCV, which Phalcon/
 SKISM has covered with commendable speed and accuracy, thanks guys!

        Now, I  must say both 'Thank  You,'  and 'Fuck You,' to all Virulent
 Graffiti members, who  have both tried and not tried to get articles in for
 ID.  I,  being the  asshole-take  charge type guy  I am edited and put this
 issue together  in  about 4 days, and  will probably release it without the
 knowledge of  the  group... I  am quite  happy with  it,  mainly because it
 contains my disassemblies, and  little else... If  you don't love yourself,
 who do you love? Also, I  am trying  something new... I know that I love to
 view  the activation routines out of viruses,  but, ripping the code out is
 an undue pain in  the  ass, and,  I'd  rather not  run just any virus on my
 system... I  have ripped the 'bomb' routines from Otto6, Soupy, and Fellow-
 ship, and left them as seperate  code under  the  disassemblies... Go ahead
 and assemble  'em,  show 'em  off...  trade  with friends... ah... I need a
 life..

        You'll  note that this has a 40Hexish/Social Delinquency look to it.
 Well,  both of those publications are quite successful, so I figured that I
 should use a  conglomeration to  see what I could come up with... For those
 of you that (in the past) call us a P/S copy  group, we will again tell you
 to go  fuck yourselves... True, we  both are  doing a  YAM disassembly, and
 true, I  am stealing  a little  of  the  format, but,  the  first is a pure
 coincedence, and the seconds is professional opinion over ownership... Also
 note that we are never planning to release an MPC hack, in Pascal or other-
 wise!
