                          ========================       
       
       I  am  surprised that  so  many  well  respected  Virus-L readers and
 writers  failed to  understand the implication of creating 1500 viruses per
 day that  are  not  detected by  existing scanners.   The point is that the
 number  or percentqge of viruses detected is not as important as the effect
 of the product.

       Of  the CARO  collection of  over 1500  viruses, only a small portion
 have  ever been  found at  a substantial  number of  sites,  and  many  are 
 collector-only viruses that have never appeared in the wild.

        I am  quite astounded  by the  concept  that creating viruses in the
 privacy of  my home  should offend  anti-virus  types.  In fact, I have had 
 automated virus generation systems running for several years. At one point,
 I was  trying to create ecosystems by randomly generating tens of thousands
 of candidates per  day, many  of  which were  successful viruses.  Why does
 this  offend other  researchers?  And  I  take it from some of the comments
 that these  researchers have  NEVER created a virus of their own to explore
 the concept!   It's  sad that  people who  have never tried it feel free to
 condemn it.   Or have  they done  it and simply don't have the integrity to
 admit it?

         ASP  has already  introduced  one  virus-based  commercial  product 
 (which  has never been detected  as  a virus by any scanner) which operates
 quite well,  and  we  are in  the process  of creating  another virus-based
 product  designed to operate  in LANs.  Our users don't seem to be offended
 by  the  optimization of  resource utilization, automated  distribution and
 installation, high  reliability, and small space used by our products based
 on viruses, but it seems  to  offend the  anti-virus  community that all of
 their overblown  claims about  all viruses being bad are being undercut  by
 benevolent viruses  that are  safe and  reliable.   In  fact, most  of  our
 viruses  work on  far more systems than most virus defenses, and they don't
 spread where they are  not supposed  to  go.   They are easy to control and
 remove,  they are  compatable with  every  DOS based system we have seen to
 date, and  they have  never generated  any unintended  side-effects.  Kinda
 blows the whole "all viruses are bad" thing, huh!

        P.S. considering the people who agree with my recent postings, I may
 have  been  wrong -  nah -  you  know  you're not saying much when everyone
 agrees with you - the lemmings to the sea thing and all.
