                           =======================
                             Rapidly Approaching

                           =======================

        Virulent Graffiti  is  rapidly  approaching 1  year of life, amazing
 that we could hold together that long, eh? We actually survived the summer,
 the return of the  school year... the fact  that we were doing nothing, and
 an abrupt name change, VG to VGVPO.

        Actually,  I  am approaching  the 1  year  mark  on  learning  80x86
 assembly...  quite strange,  a year later, to look back that the total shit
 code that  I was  doing in WASM, and to see some of the things I was doing,
 and actually calling viruses!

        On the  personal level,  I am  quite happy with myself, and greatful
 of the  people like  the Dark Avenger, Dark Angel, and others that have the
 know-how and desire to  help  teach the  world about  virus  writing.  I am
 amazed at  the progress that I have made myself, both in virus writing, and
 in programming in  general... and especially that I have the highest poster
 status on Digital Warfare Private (at least, when I wrote this...)

        On the group  level,  I feel deflated, but good... an idea that was
 pushed onto  me by The Fly, on March 14th,  1992, becoming the  semi-large
 thing that  it  has become  today... really nice, if you ask me, but, then
 again, who does...

        Now comes  the question of what I'm going to do this year... We have
 lots of  things waiting in the wings for that little extra push to get them
 going... a  sub-stealth  virus,  a  multipartite  virus,  and a little code
 generator (not for generating viruses, but, for generating dazzingly boring
 encryption and decryption routines,  without actaully  being a polymorphing
 engine!)...  hopefully,  little side  projects I  have, like loaders, sound
 routines, and such will fall into place, and we can grab a little ground in
 the demo-group world as well...

        Big ideas  for a  kid from  a small town in Ohio, eh? Maybe... maybe
 not... Certainly,  in Telcom,  no  one  is there  to  ask my age, or for my
 college degree...  all  I need  to do  is whip out a little code, throw the
 reputation around  a little... wire them a couple hund- err, you get what I
 mean... It's all open to us, sounds fun, eh?
 
 Damn straight it is...
