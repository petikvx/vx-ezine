Hey, I have a true story for you all. 
 
I  got a  call from  a doctor' s office. Their computers were acting strange
and  locking up  so I went over there and took a look at the system. Nothing
was out  of place  until I scanned it. Turns out, the guy has a Stoned virus
that's gone  critical  and  he  didn't  even know it. He had scan but didn't
know how to run  it. Since the system was already critical, I needed a clean
system disk  to run  CLEAN.  It  turns out the system disk(the original) was
infected  too.   The   other   2  copies  of  the  system  disk,  Dbase 3++,
Wordperfect,  Windows 3.1,  all of  them. Every single application and every
single  disk he  had were infected. I didn't have a system disk with me so I
had  to charge  him double  for going  home and getting one. Some people are
sooooooooo ignorant. What a moron.

        Okay, Mr. Greely... what a moron, eh?

        Is  this  the  message Anti-Virus  wants  to give to the public? Be
 smart or else... I hardly think so...

        Anyway,  as  for  this  message, I feel so stupid now, 'cuz I don't
 have  a  system disk  laying here,  and you' d  probably have to charge me
 double! I  think that  I should  probably be  shot  because  I am so anti-
 virus ignorant.

        Wake  up,  you idiot!  The man didn't know... so, you ridicule him,
 not a  brilliant strategy.  The man  needed to  be informed, not chastized
 behind his back...

        I'm   not   sure, is   this  the   attitude   of   most  "Anti-Virus
 Professionals?"  I'd  like to  know... if  you consider yourself one, write
 us on one of our boards...
