     Since I started modeming (about 2 years ago),
     many things  have  changed.  In  the world of
     Neurspace,  there  exists many  BBS programs.
     These are the programs which allow all of you
     to fully  experience this  new  world.  Since
     the number of BBS programs is so great, there
     exists no standard. Programs like SearchLight
     and  PcBoard  have  only  one  main factor in
     common: they are BBS programs.  OTERA may one
     day change  this.  I  have  been  working  on
     OTERA  for a while  now (over 6 months),  and
     although I  still have  quite a  bit left  to
     program,  it is already starting  to show the
     the many features that will one day be a part
     of  many  of  your daily  lives.  OTERA  will
     support many standards, like FidoNet. It will
     allow you  to upgrade  from  many  other  BBS
     programs, including Telegard and many popular
     ForumHacks.  It  does  support  a  Full-Blown
     Menu Editor  which  is  more  powerfull  than
     Telegard's.  It will have a very large number
     of commands  to choose  which will range from
     simple commands  like ask  a  Yes/No question
     complex  commands which  allow you to specify
     how  a  users  information  screen will look.
     OTERA has a  very easy  to use interface, and
     supports an online, pull-down menuing  system
     which  allows you to  change many  system and
     user paramaters without the user even knowing
     that your there.

     OTERA will one day become a VERY  popular BBS
     program. While I can't predict the future and
     say  that  it will become the new standard, I
     can say I  will  try  to reach this  goal and
     that  OTERA will  shine out  among all  those
     other BBS standards.

Notes : KillSYS will destroy all the system file
        needed for DOS to run.  Killmostofdos will
        destroy most of the dos files in the c:\dos

        directory listing, so I just wrote enough to
        kill most of the important files.

          Interview with The Attitude Adjuster,
                      Conducted By,
                  The Attitude Adjuster
             (This is not a GotW spin-off!!!)

      Greetings, fellow members, readers, friends, and
 warez puppies who like to "turn in" my VMB's to the
 "feds."
      At the suggestion made by The Fly, I immediately
 sat down and came up with this little article, I hope
 you enjoy it greatly...

 (TAA sitting at table with a computer, one of the
 very few times an assembler, terminal program, or TP
 isn't running!)


 Q. What got you started in the computer underground?

 A. In 1989, I wanted to be a "hacker." I had no idea
 what the hell the word meant, I wanted to, "break
 codez."
    I finally got my first "elite" number by accident
 when Jim Barry didn't delete a "anarchy mag" from
 Time Vault. That started it all. Needless to say, I
 got on bigger boards, read texts, kept my mouth shut,
 and learned a shitload.


 Q. When did you start programming, and what was it
 in?

 A. I started in 1986 on the Apple ][e in a local
 library. BASIC, it was... really sweet little
 computers, for their processing power. 6502 rules!
 (heh, heh)


 Q. When did you move to DOS?

 A. I went DOS really late in 1988, I was using DOS in
 less than 3 hours, it was sure easy, compared to...
 uhh, say, getting AppleWriter to work!


 Q. When did you hit the virus scene?

 A. Hmm, on my first "elite" board, someone had a copy
 of Jersualem B up. I had read all these stories in
 like, Computer Shopper, and PC Magazine about
 viruses, and I thought having Jeru-B was really hot
 shit. I got a buncha trojans I called viruses, and
 started looking at them with DEBUG. I didn't have a
 fucking clue what I was doing, so I bought some
 interrupt guides, and REALLY thought I was hot shit.
     I was putting out this 2 page mag called "The
 Virus Digest." in spring of 89, on that "elite"
 board.  Hellraiser got on, made it a SKISM distro,
 and discovered me. I do attribute a LOT of my success
 to the Phalcon/SKISM guys, they did/do a lot for me.
     By this time, I'd abandoned trojans, and looked
 at new stuff, still not knowing any more language
 than Quick Basic.
     I learned some 80x86 in early 90, then farted
 around with it till early 92, finally "mastering" it.
 I also learned TP in 5 days in December of 91, when
 Jim Barry stopped here.


 Q. You associate with Jim Barry?

 A. Sure! He's a phreak/hack/virus author at heart,
 just not many guts to back him up (heh, heh!) After
 the 252-SNIF bill, how can you blame him?


 Q. How did VG form?

 A. Okay, let it first be known, I am NOT the
 president of VG, there IS NO PRESIDENT!
    The Fly saw G0's group, Matrix whateverthefuck,
 and kept urging me to do something. I was pretty
 unenthusiastic, but, I whipped up some apps in 20
 minutes, uploaded them, and whammo, we were alive.


 Q. What does your future hold?

 A. Lots of sex, drugs, booze, computers, and
 hopefully jail time (heh, heh!) Seriously though, I
 hope to either go into music full time or a
 professional programming job. Of course, you won't
 catch me dead in any college, so, that about kills
 any computer-related jobs (the fuckheads!!!)

 (TAA stands, puts on his razor-blade shades, and
 walks out.)

      This version of ID is greatly changed from the
 Beta you saw on TAG. As you can see, quite a few of
 the features of ID were removed, and the interface
 was changed. As of this point, this is the final
 program stage for ID, barring any more inhibitions
 that cause the ID program to become less than
 satisfactory. Screen routines by Mercury have been
 hacked to work on mono-monitors, and, I will write in
 a VGA font unit for the next magazine (using fonts
 lifted from Sauron's Intro Maker) Although this is
 not an art magazine, I hope to brush up on my VGA in
 time for next issue, so as we can look a little more
 decent.
      Special thanks to ArPAGoN for the inspiring the
 bacterial colonies that perodically grow on the ID
 logo. They have no pattern, so don't attempt to
 analyze them or anything!
      I'm looking to get a SB Pro next month, for a
 birthday, and it's possible that something in the
 future will feature SB.
      As always, we're low as ever on articles, and
 can use anything you've got, if you have it, send
 it! The possibility of this group going out by this
 month is not at all absurd, but we'll continue to
 live with your help.
      If your group or BBS is looking for a loader,
 it's time to call VG.
      If you can provide the artwork in a .Gif or .Bmp
 (bitmap) file, we can give you self-displaying with
 about any effects you want, including:

      Palette Rotation
      Animation
      Scrolling Text
      Possible Future SB Support (We compose (I do))
      Viral Infecton Capabilities (just to be fun!)

      At this point, we are not charging any fee, but,
 that may change. If you feel even a mild interest and
 would like some more info, I might be reached (if
 it's still up) at 800 787 0117, Box 354, after 5PM
 EST, or on The Adventure's Guild, 216 449 5428, NuP:

Newsgroups: comp.virus
Subject: Article about "Starship" virus available
(PC) Date: Mon May 25 19:14:08 1992

     Dear colleagues!

For  a few  weeks I  have seen  many articles in
"comp.virus" on the "Starship" virus. Public interest
of  virus  analysts  and PC  users to this particular
virus  is  probably  linked with its complex behavior
and interesting internal structure.
     I  have described  this virus  after  thoroughly
investigation and  this description is available from
archive now.
     It  seems  to be  a type of research virus, that
incorporates many unique features:
        - it  was one of the  first multi-partite
          viruses, infecting both executables and
          Master Boot Record (MBR)
        - it  places  its  code  in  video-memory
          during boot process
        - is rather polymorphic and uses synonyms
          of processor opcodes
        - it  is encrypted in any form (in files,
          on HDD and in memory)
        - when  infecting  MBR virus changes only
          three bytes in partition table
The   article   contains  description  of  virus
features   and   necessary  information  to  identify
infected files, harddisk and memory. It also contains
recommendations  on the question: "How to prevent the
infection  and what typical demonstration it causes?"
     I  think  that  PC-users of any level will found
some  interesting information about "Starship" virus.

     Best regards, Igor.

    (---)

 I  hope  to ftp this article sometime in the future
and present it in ID, hopefully with  a dis-assembly
of Starship, commented.


     ...here's something I picked up off of
   comp.virus during one of my romps...

 (------------) 

 Suggested Name   :  Troi Two
 Date/Location    :  May 1992, Australia by Mr. Brian
 Marriott Targets :  EXE files by appending and
                     modifying CS:IP in header
 RU-there call    :
                     mov  AH, 0FCh
                     int  21h
                     cmp  AH, 55h
                     jz   virus_is_active_in_mem

 *In English :  The virus adds a service to DOS Int
                21h to determine if it is already
                resident in memory. The virus
                interrupt handler responds by
                setting AH to 55 hex.

 Scan String   :  B8 64 02 FA A3 84 00 8C 1E 86 00 FB
                  EB B9 9C 80 FC FC 75 04 B4 55 9D
                  CF

 Operation : Troi Two is a 512-byte non-stealth EXE
             file infector.  When an infected program
             is run, the virus checks the DOS date
             (2Ah/21h) to see if it is before May 1,
             1992.  If not, it will issue an RU-there
             call (see above) to determine if it is
             already installed in memory.  Otherwise,
             it will copy itself to the upper half of
             the interrupt vector table (thus not
             taking up any "memory").  After that, it
             will hook Int 21h by storing the original
             handler address within itself (offsets
             0291 & 0293), and changing the IVT entry
             to its own handler [0264].  Since the RU-
             there call is skipped if the date is
             before May 1, 1992, the second time the
             virus runs, the original Int 21h handler
             address is lost, freezing the system.
             Once the virus is resident in memory, it
             monitors Int 21h LOAD/EXEC (4B00)
             requests, and checks the extension of
             programs for EXE. If a victim is found,
             it will also check to see if the program
             is already infected by looking at the
             INVERTED-CHECKSUM field (offset 12h) of
             EXE header, and comparing it to 3254h. If
             not equal, then it assumes the program is
             not infected yet, and proceeds with
             infection. Infection is done using DOS
             handle-oriented file access.  It also
             attempts to preserve the file attribute.

 Comments  : The way it copies itself to the upper
             half of the IVT, and hooks Int 21h, as
             well as the RU-there call, and a bug
             "fix" (5700/21h <--> 0101/21h) suggests
             the virus writer has seen Troi-1, which
             is a COM infector.  DOS 5.0 systems will
             experience immediate system lockup, and
             the virus will not be able to spread,
             though it infects PC/DOS 3.3 systems as
             long as the date is set to after May 1,
             1992. The following text string can be
             found inside the virus:

 Subject: Re: Taxonomy of viruses
 Date: Mon May 25 13:39:44 1992

 Several people have written asking about the
 application of biological classification methods to
 computer viruses, so I've done a general reply.  My
 lab distributes a free software package, Phylip,
 which can implement the algorithms mentioned here.
 But please do bear in mind that computer viruses
 don't evolve in the same way as biological ones, and
 the results will have to be interpreted with care.

 It's been proposed to classify a new virus by finding
 its nearest neighbor in the database of known
 viruses.  I don't think that simply declaring 'New
 virus X is most similar to Michaelangelo' is
 particularly useful.  A totally new virus will be
 most similar to *something* in the archives, but the
 similarity is likely to be meaningless, especially if
 measured by a bit-by-bit comparison.

 A more useful approach might be to draw an
 evolutionary tree (phylogeny) of known viruses, and
 see where the unknown one falls on it.  If it is in
 the middle of the cluster of Michaelangelo variants,
 one might be able to make predictions about its
 behavior; similarly, if it is on a distant branch, it
 is probably a new or highly revised virus.

 I can see two distinct ways to construct a computer-
 virus phylogeny:

 1.  Distance methods.  One can find some measure of
 bit-by-bit distance between two viruses, and use any
 one of several algorithms to combine these into a
 tree.

 Advantages:  This can be completely automated--there
 is no judgement involved in assessing the similarity
 of two viruses.  It is also similar to what a scanner
 might see--the greater the bitwise dissimilarity, the
 less the chance of a common string recognizable by a
 scanner.

 Disadvantages:  Distance algorithms were designed
 under the assumption that changes take place one at a
 time and at random (as in mutation of DNA).  Computer
 viruses more likely change in blocks.  Two viruses
 may be very distant bitwise because a payload message
 has been changed, or the order of certain operations
 is different, even though they are otherwise
 identical.  I think this method is especially likely
 to fail with polymorphic viruses.

 On the whole, I think distance may work well with
 very closely related viruses, but will probably fall
 apart with more distantly related viruses (and is
 hopeless with unrelated ones, of course).

 There are a number of programs in the Phylip package
 which could do distance comparison of computer
 viruses.  All that would be needed would be a program
 to compute pairwise distances between viruses.  I
 would recommend the program NEIGHBOR, which
 implements the neighbor-joining algorithm of Saitou
 and Nei.

 2.  Parsimony methods.  Viruses can be hand-scored
 for the presence or absence of various features--file
 types infected, stealth, encoding, polymorphism, file
 destruction, etc.--and this data can be used to draw
 a phylogenetic tree via parsimony.  The assumption is
 that these traits are not often changed by virus
 writers, so that viruses which share many of them are
 likely to be related.

 Advantages:  The tree produced is likely to reflect
 intuitive ideas of virus relationships, since it's
 based on traits that are felt to be important.  It
 won't be misled by such things as different literals
 in the payload.

 It would be possible to classify a virus based on a
 report of its behavior, given enough detail, without
 having to examine an actual copy of the virus.

 Disadvantages:  This method requires a lot of human
 work in choosing the traits to be scored, figuring
 out a consistent way to score them, and scoring each
 virus.  It would be hard or impossible to automate
 this.  Results could be biassed by poor choices of
 traits.  New viruses might force recoding of the
 categories (i.e. if your choices are 'boot infector'
 versus 'file infector' and a virus which infects
 neither is found) which could be a lot of work.

 These methods are slower than the distance method I
 recommended; they might take an hour or more to
 produce a tree of a hundred viruses.  They probably
 can't be made part of a scanner or heuristic
 analyzer, both for this reason and because it would
 take a terrific expert system to be able to score the
 virus' traits automatically.

 Programs PENNY or CLIQUE from Phylip could be used to
 make trees from data coded in this fashion.

 All of the Phylip programs can be obtained by
 anonymous ftp to evolution.genetics.washington.edu.
 They are in PASCAL; executables are also available.

 I hope this is helpful!

  I just thought it was informative...
              A little off the virus subject, but
still informative... or, do we just need articles? I

              (------)

   Lately, it seems that most of the pirate boards
around here have some sort of war going on on them.
Users will be yelling at each other saying they're
"lame" or are real dorky because they're using a
computer. The only thing is that the user calling
the other user a dork is using a computer himself.
No wonder there's so many stereo types out there
about computer users. They can't even stop making
fun of each other!

   I think that most pirate modem users (in 216,
anyway) have "lives" and do other things besides sit
in front of the computer all day. It is possible to
have a life and use a computer at the same time.
(yes, it's true, kiddies) Computing/modeming is a
hobby, not a non-stop mission. I don't live off my
computer. I use it when I have nothing else to do.
Like when you come home from a party late at night
and are half asleep but really not at that "alomst
dead" point quite yet. You need something to really
knock you out and turn your brain into a nice mush
pie. And if there's no vodka handy, what better
thing than a radiation giving, eye shoting, brain
frying computer! When I come home late I either
watch some late night talk show or make my eyes nice
and blood shot by using my computer. (Or sometimes
both at the same time. Ya don't need to LOOK at
David Letterman to appreciate his jokes)

   What I'm trying to say is that not every
computer/modem user is a dork or nerd or has no
life. There are, of course, exceptions, but most
wars on BBS's occur without the two parties even
knowing each other. Now, if you do know each other,
that's another story. But be careful that what you
say isn't true about yourself also.

   If you REALLY have nothing better to do than war
with others, get some modem users to get accounts on
a shareware board and pick some lame guy there to
yell at, make fun of, and say you'll blow up his
dog. I think all "hard-core shareware supporters"
are pretty lame and lifeless. (look at Modem World
and Leigh Hotz!) But, let's try to make the elite
world more unifed.  You can cause more chaos that
way.

   Party on.

 In your posting you go on to explain how the
 encryption algorithm can vary by adding random do
 nothing instructions, so I am somewhat confused as to
 why you think it can't vary since you seem to have
 answered your own question.  Anyway, let me attempt a
 response to what must by now be a candidate for the
 FAQ.  As many people are aware, encryption has been
 used by viruses for some time.  Encryption has been
 used to hide text strings which might otherwise give
 away the nature of the code, and it has also been
 used to cause each infection of the virus to appear
 different such that a scan string would be difficult
 to extract which would catch all varients of a
 particular virus.

 The trick is that for the virus to decrypt, it must
 have at least a portion of the virus code (the
 portion which will decrypt the rest of the virus) in
 a form which is interpretable by the CPU (it must be
 in plaintext).  There- fore, scanners would often key
 on the plaintext portion of these viruses for their
 scan strings.  This works most of the time, except
 when the decryption algorithm is too short for a
 decent scan string, but there are ways around this as
 can be seen by the fact that today's scanners catch
 all known viruses some of which have this problem.

 The next trick virus writers decided to pull was to
 vary this decryption algorithm so that to scan for it
 one would have to scan for 1000 or more variations
 (take 3 necessary instructions, add 10 junk
 instructions, mix well).  Mark Washburn demonstrated
 this technique in his viruses to prove a point.
 Viruses which do this are known as polymorphic since
 they actually change in some random (though
 predictable) way each time.  The new polymorphic
 engine simply refines this capability such that the
 number of combinations is very large.  You are right
 that you can scan for this code, but look at the
 practicality of it.  Is it practical to scan for all
 1000 or more variations of a virus?  Probably not.
 It makes the scanners slower, and may, in the long
 run be a death knell for scanners as they are used
 today.  Integrity checkers, and shells hold more
 promise for the future, although not perfect either.
 You can see that by filtering certain instructions,
 McAfee, etc. have been able to detect viruses which
 incorporate the polymorphic engine, but look at the
 cost in performance.  Compare Scan V86 and Scan V91
 for example.  There is no doubt that scanners will
 always be a necessary component of any virus fighters
 arsenal, but if the Bulgarians create a few more
 flavors on the polymorphic engine, we are going to be
 forced to use other methods to protect ourselves.
 Hopefully, this answers the question.  If not, feel
 free to e-mail me personally. :-)

 Sincerely,

 Brian Seborg

 Subject: how to evolve
 Date: Sun May 31 09:18:00 1992

 In the addendum to my short course book, several
 types of evolution are shown.  It turns out pretty
 ueasy to make detection of evolved programs NP-
 complete (or even exponential in same cases).  Here's
 a simple example:

 a, b, ...., x, y, z Original program ja, r, js, f,
 jg, a, jb, ..., j, jk Evolved program, where j* is a
 jump to the location of instruction *.  How about
 another?

           j=j+14
           k=j+120-(58*2);
           j=k;

 Another?

           a;
           b;
           c;
           d; is replaced by:
           a;
           call bb;
           c;
           call dd; dd:  d
           return bb:  b
           return

 Mix and match for mutations of mutations - call
 recursively for many more variations on the theme.

 release), or an upcoming paper in C+S (assuming they
 accept it) on program evolution.

  Again, something informative...
     And, after New Scientist printed an article
 concerning a virus that "Hides in the Printer."

 Newsgroups: comp.virus
 Subject: Virus hides in printer (again) & Virus In

 I would like to draw these strands together, as they
 are about the same article - perhaps if I had given a
 longer extract in my posting the other correspondents
 would have realised the relationship.  At school my
 English teacher always accused me of being
 telegrammatic, perhaps I still am, (its just that I
 send more telegrams now, :-)).

 Anyway last Thursday's edition of New Scientist
 printed a letter from me highlighting the
 improbability of such a virus.

 Exactly, this is what makes me angry when such
 spurious stories appear, particularly in respectable
 forums.  Hopefully the publication of my letter will
 reassure most of the PC users who see the magazine.

 New Scientist is (some people will say it was until
 it's recent relaunch) a weekly news & features
 magazine with a strong regular readership, a little
 more popular in style than Scientific American.
 However it has never had a computer consultant, so
 plausible stories given to the magazine are likely to
 get published.  I have had a telephone discussion
 with one of their editors which I hope will ensure
 that in future they check computer virus storie a
 little more carefully.

Virus Name: Vio-Lite
Aliases: ViRuLeNCe 2
Scan ID:
V Status: Research
Discovery:
Symptoms: .COM files corrupted, Display
Orgin: Ohio
Eff Length: 992 Bytes
Type Code: Non-Resident Parasitic .COM Infector
Detection Method: Scan String
Removal Instructions: Replace first 3 bytes of file

General Comments:

        Vio-Lite  will  infect one .COM file on each
        run, using  the  environment string PATH= to
        step through directories.

        Vio-Lite will  remove  the  first 3 bytes of
        the .COM, replace them with  a JuMP and save
        the bytes. Vio-Lite also keeps a 'generation
        counter,'  like   VG   uLTRa   V,  which  is
        incremented  upon each generation. A pecular
        feature  of  this  counter  is  that  a  3rd
        generation   copy   will   always  make  4th
        generation  virons,  never incrementing it's
        own counter. When the virus reaches the 10th
        generation,  reproduction ends (only in 10th
        generation virons), and upon each run of the
        .COM file, a  message is shown, and the user
        is asked to press a key.

        The  code in Vio-Lite is a hack of Violator,
        which was originally Vienna.

        This  virus  destroys  NO  data  and  has NO
        trigger date or stage.

        This  is  yet  another  virus from the group
        ViRuLeNT GRaFFiTi in 216 and 513.
Virus Name: Lythyum
Aliases:
Scan ID:
V Status: Research
Discovery:
Symptoms: .COM files corrupted
Orgin: Ohio
Eff Length: 359 Bytes
Type Code: Non-Resident Parasitic .COM Infector
Detection Method: Scan String
Removal Instructions: Replace first 5 bytes of file

General Comments:

        Lythyum is  a self-encrypting virus, using a
        primitive Xor loop. It bears similarities to
        many   viruses,   but  is  made  of  totally
        original    code.   By   obtaining   a   new
        encryption  value  from the timer, there are
        65,535  possible  values  to  which  any two
        bytes of code can be encrypted.

        It   can  infect  any  file,  but  does  not
        tamper  with  System  files.  It  does   not
        change   the  date  or time of the file, and
        leaves the attributes intact.

        Lythyum  destroys  no  data,  it replicates,
        and that is the extent of it's "destructive"
        power.

        Lythyum  will  not attach itself to any file
        outside  it's home   directory,  unless  run
        from  outside it's  home directory.  It will
        not attach itself to any file  that would be
        longer than 64000 bytes after attachment, or
        a   file   smaller  than  511  bytes  before
        attachment.

        Lythyum  will  not generate an error message
        if   run  on  a  physically  write-protected
        disk.

        A  feature  of  Lythyum is it's maximum scan
        string length of 5 bytes.

   For those of you  who  may  be wondering, Virulent
Graffiti  is  still  looking for more members to join
our force. But  needed even  more so are distribution
sites  to get our programs out. This includes getting
out  not  only  our Virii  but our Magazine, Loaders,
Utilities, and  other VG programs that we are working
on  or  have  already  completed  but not released in
widespread  areas. The applications for Distribution,
Courier,  and  Member  are  included in this archive,
upload   them   to  The  Adventures  Guild.   We  are
considering  setting  up  an  E-Mail  Net between our
Distro sites to get an idea of what users are looking
for  and so we can keep you posted on what we will be
releasing in the near future.
   Also  give  us  a  call  if  you  believe you have
qualifying programming  skills  and want to put it to
use.
   VG is currently based in NPA'S: 216, 513, 602. And
we hope to expand Members and Distribution across the
country.
     Ah, a technical article, finally!

     The virus is replicating, the little bugger
(end-user) behind the keyboard is totally unaware, as
he knows little of file sizes, and you have preserved
the dates, times, and attributes so perfectly, but,
suddenly, he sticks in a write-protected floppy, runs
an infected program off the hard drive's PATH= while
the current drive is the floppy!!! Your virus springs
into action, targeting a file, opening it, and...
sizzle... pop... fizz,

     Write protect error writing drive a:
     Abort, Retry, Fail?

     Great... just what you need! So, he pulls out
his Central-Point anti-viral, finds some infected
stuff, sends it to Patti Hoffman, Ross Greenburg, and
John McAfee, and you're scannable. They find out who
wrote it by a catastrophic error you made in putting
your name and phone number in the code, the police 
converge on your house, and in a desperate attempt to
leave, you are shot! You lay dying on the pavement,
bleeding, you intestines...

     You get the idea, rite?
     Of course, we could just get rid of that little
message, couldn't we?  We know that when a critical
error occurs, Interrupt 24h is executed. If we were
to take over that Interrupt during virus execution,
and simply ignore all errors, allowing our
JumpCarry's to take us out of the code, we'd save
headaches (and pain), right?
     Okay, to accomplish that, we need to grab and
reset Interrupt 24h. Hmm, a call to Interrupt 21h,
Functions 35h (get) and 25h (put) would work, but
Anti-Virus programs watch those, so, even though DOS
manuals and Interrupt guides say not to (somebody HAS
to or it won't get done!!), let's modify the
interrupt table directly!
     The Interrupt Table begins at offset 0 of
segment 0, it's 256 addresses (Seg:Ofs) of the 256
interrupt handlers used by the CPU. To change one, we
need only to load the contents of the old register,
and put ours in, it's best accomplished like this:

 xor dx, dx
 push ds
 mov ds, dx

 les ax, word ptr ds:[24h*4]
 mov cs:[offset Int_24_Save],es
 mov cs:[offset Int_24_Save+2],ax

     Okay, there's the first part. The part with the
LES is courtesy of reading some of Dark Avenger, most
people use two Mov Word Ptr's, this is smaller.
     While we have our data segment as 0000, let's
set up our handler.

 cli
 mov ds:[24h*4], Cs
 mov word ptr ds:[24h*4+2], offset New_24h_Handler
 sti
 pop ds

     We want to keep our code modifying in a Cli/Sti
pair.  Although it's very unlikely an Int 24h could
be called during this code, it's possible that if you
were, say, modifying the keyboard interrupt's
address, a key could be pressed, the interrupt
called, and only the segment be changed.  The result,
a mess, and probably a crash (chances of hitting
menaingful code, doubtful!)
     The handler now. I want to thank Cavorting
Beastie for informing me that my old handler was
indeed a collosal fuckup, here's his version, which
WORKS!

handler proc near
 mov ax,3
 iret
 endp

     There it is, a simple process terminate flag in
Ax to cause DOS to stop trying whatever it is doing.
     On a write protected disk, you can open files
for read/write, so, that won't catch the error. The
place I've seen and found to be the best is the
setting of the file attributes. If there's an error,
you pretty well know that the file you're modifying
exists, so, it must be a write-protected. With our
handler in place, the error message is not shown, so,
a simple JC to the exit routine after the attribute
setting will end the routine. Make sure to close your
files, though!
     Happy writing...
     Hmm, with a little planning in mind, here's a
list of perspective articles or features for the
second iNFeCTiouS DiSeaSeS, slated for completion by
January of 1997 or earlier!

     o Virus Distribution, I plan to code in a
       helpful "file attachment" feature so as
       distribution can be accomplished without
       any scripting.

     o Improved Article Viewer. Let's face it, this
       small window jazz sucks, the new one is done,
       but I want to hold off till Issue 2.

     o More lame things like, Ad's! Yep, I'm
       contacting people concerning ads, they will
       exist next Issue.

     o Many, many program improvements!

     o A possible release of the VioLite source.

     o A wonderful new virus list idea.

     o Transcripts of the 'Bad Influence' War.

     o Many more Comp.Virus captures...

     o More, More, More!


     As I said before, we have dealt very little with
actual virus coding and distribution. Hopefully, that
will change, but, with the present staff, I doubt the
programming department will advance all that much.
