<P>AIR FORCE INVESTIGATIVE OFFICE DEEMED INCOMPETENT DURING
ROME LABS 'INFO-WAR' BREAK-IN</P>

<P>"The cream of US military intelligence last week had their
bungled attempt to prosecute a bedroom hacker thrown out by a British
court," screamed the lead of a November 28, 1997 piece in the United
Kingdom newspaper, The Guardian.</P>

<P>Even as the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection
was spinning yet more scenarios of imminent techno-Gotterdammerung, the
wheels were coming off one of the U.S. military's most extensive
public relations campaigns. Aimed at creating the image of menacing 
hackers in the employ of foreign powers, U.S. Air Force claims fell 
apart in English court, out of sight of the U.S. newsmedia as the U.K. 
press looked on and smirked.</P>

<P>Matthew Bevan, 23, a hacker known as Kuji, walked out of a south London
Crown Court a free man as prosecutors confessed it wasn't worth trying
him on the basis of flimsy claims made by the U.S. military. Further,
he was deemed no threat to national computer security.</P>

<P>Since 1994, the U.S. government has used Bevan, and a younger partner,
Richard Pryce, in reports by the Air Force, the Government Accounting
Office, the Pentagon's Defense Science Board report on information warfare
and the recent Marsh Commission, on the dangers posed by international
terrorists using the worldwide computer networks to attack the
United States.</P>

<P>". . . [the] story of the Bevan and Pryce cases shows [the Air Force's]
forensic work to have been so poor it would have been unlikely to have
stood up in court and convicted Bevan. The public portrayal of the two
Britons as major threats to U.S. national security was pure hype," wrote
Duncan Campbell for The Guardian.</P>

<P>However, events really began in 1994, when the two young men broke 
into an Air Force installation known as Rome Labs, a facility at the now 
closed Griffiss Air Force Base, in New York. This break-in
became the centerpiece of a Government Accounting Office report on network
intrusions at the Department of Defense in 1996 and also constituted
the meat of a report entitled "Security and Cyberspace" by Dan Gelber
and Jim Christy, presented to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations during hearings on hacker break-ins the same year.
It is interesting to note that Christy, the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations staffer/author of this report, was never at Rome while
the break-ins were being monitored.</P>

<P>Before delving into this in detail, it's interesting to read what 
a British newspaper published about Richard Pryce, known as Datastream 
Cowboy, then seventeen, about a year before he was made the poster boy 
by the GAO.</P>

<P>In a brief article, blessedly so in contrast to the reams of propaganda
published on the incident for Congress, the July 5, 1995 edition of The
Independent wrote, "[Datastream Cowboy] appeared before Bow Street
magistrates yesterday charged with unlawfully gaining access to a series
of American defense computers. Richard Pryce, who was 16 at the time of
the alleged offences, is accused of accessing key U.S. Air Force systems
and a network owned by Lockheed, the missile and aircraft
manufacturers."</P>

<P>Pryce, a resident of a northwest suburb of London, was charged with 12
separate offenses under the British Computer Misuse Act.  He was arrested
on May 12, 1994, by New Scotland Yard. The Times of London reported when
police came for Pryce, they found him at his PC on the third floor of
his family's house.  Knowing he was about to be arrested, he "curled up
on the floor and cried."</P>

<P>The Air Force's tracking of Pryce, and to a lesser extent, Bevan,
was recounted in an eight page appendix to Gelber's and Christy's 
"Security and Cyberspace," entitled "The Case Study: Rome Laboratory, 
Griffiss Air Force Base, NY Intrusion."</P> 

<P>Pryce's entry into Air Force computers was originally noticed on
March 28, 1994, when personnel discovered a sniffer program he had
installed on one of the Air Force systems in Rome.  The Defense Information
System Agency (DISA) was notified.  DISA subsequently called the Air
Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) at the Air Force
Information W`‚
!re Center (AFIWC) in San Antonio, Texas. AFIWC then
sent a team to Rome to appraise the break-in, secure the system and
trace those responsible.  During the process, the AFIWC team 
of computer scientists -- not AFOSI investigators, a point not 
clearly made by the Air Force authors and one that becomes more important 
upon viewing the fallout and repercussions of the case -- discovered 
Datastream Cowboy had entered the Rome Air Force computers for the 
first time on March 25.  Passwords had been compromised, electronic 
mail read and deleted and unclassified "battlefield simulation" data 
copied off the facility. The Rome network was also used as a staging 
area for penetration of other systems on the Internet.</P>

<P>Air Force personnel initially traced the break-in back one step to
the New York City provider, Mindvox. According to the Christy
report, this put the NYC provider under suspicion because "newspaper
articles" said Mindvox's computer security was furnished by two "former
Legion of Doom members." "The Legion of Doom is a loose-knit computer
hacker group which had several members convicted for intrusions into
corporate telephone switches in 1990 and 1991," wrote Gelber and
Christy.</P>

<P>The Air Force then got permission to begin monitoring -- the 
equivalent of wiretapping -- all communications on the Rome Labs network.  
Limited observation of other Internet providers being used during the 
break-in was conducted from the Rome facilities.  Monitoring told the 
investigators the handles of hackers involved in the break-in were 
Datastream Cowboy and Kuji.</P>

<P>Since the monitoring was of limited value in determining the whereabouts
of Datastream Cowboy and Kuji, investigators resorted to "their human 
intelligence network of informants, i.e., stool pigeons, that 'surf the 
Internet.' Gossip from one 'Net stoolie to Air Force investigators 
uncovered that Datastream Cowboy -- [Richard Pryce] -- was from Britain. 
The anonymous source said he had e-mail correspondence with Datastream Cowboy in which the hacker said
he was a 16-year old living in England who enjoyed penetrating ".MIL"
systems. Datastream ‚
7boy also apparently ran a bulletin board system
and gave the telephone number to the AFOSI source.</P>

<P>The Air Force team contacted New Scotland Yard and the British law
enforcement agency identified the residence, the home of Richard
Pryce, which corresponded to Datastream Cowboy's system phone number.
English authorities began observing Pryce's phone calls and noticed
he was making fraudulent use of British Telecom.  In addition,
whenever intrusions at the Air Force network in Rome occurred, Pryce's
number was seen to be making illegal calls out of Britain.</P>

<P>Pryce travelled everywhere on the Internet, going through South America,
multiple countries in Europe and Mexico, occasionally entering the Rome
network.  From Air Force computers, he would enter systems at Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Since Pryce was, according to 
Air Force investigators, capturing the logins
and passwords of the networks in Rome Labs, he was then able to
get into the home systems of Rome network users, defense contractors
like Lockheed.</P>

<P>By mid-April of 1994 the Air Force was monitoring other systems being
used by the British hackers. On the 14th of the month, Kuji logged on
to the Goddard Space Center from a system in Latvia and copied data
from it to the Baltic country.  According to Gelber's report, the
Air Force observers assumed the worst, that it was a sign that someone
in an eastern European country was making a grab for sensitive
information.  They broke the connection but not before Kuji had
copied files off the Goddard system.  As it turned out, the Latvian
computer was just another system the British hackers were using as
a stepping stone; Pryce had also used it to cover his tracks when
penetrating networks at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, via
an intermediate system in Seattle, cyberspace.com.</P>

<P>The next day, according to the AFOSI report, Kuji was again observed 
trying to probe various systems at NATO in Brussels and The Hague as 
well as Wright-Patterson. On the 19th, Datastream Cowboy successfully 
returned to NATO systems in The Hague through Mindvox.  The point Gelber 
and Christy were laboriously trying to make was that Kuji -- Matthew 
Bevan -- a 21-year old, was coaching Pryce during some of his attacks 
on various systems.</P>

<P>By this point, New Scotland Yard had a search warrant for Pryce
with the plan being to swoop down on him the next time he accessed
the Air Force network in Rome.</P>

<P>In April, Datastream Cowboy penetrated a system on the Korean 
peninsula and copied material off a facility called the Korean Atomic 
Research Institute to an Air Force computer in Rome. At the time, the 
investigators had no idea whether the system was in North or South Korea.  
The impression created was one of hysteria and confusion at Rome. There 
was fear that the system, if in North Korea, would trigger an international 
incident, with the hack interpreted as an "aggressive act of war." The 
system turned out to be in South Korea.</P>

<P>It's worth noting that while the story was portrayed as the work of
an anonymous hacker, New Scotland Yard already had a suspect.
Further, according to Gelber's and Christy's report, English authorities 
already had a search warrant for Pryce's house.</P>

<P>On May 12, British authorities pounced.  Pryce was arrested
and his residence searched.  He crumbled, according to the Times of
London, and began to cry.  Gelber and Christy write that Pryce promptly
admitted to the Air Force break-ins as well as others.  Pryce
confessed he had copied a large program that used artificial intelligence
to construct theoretical Air Orders of Battle from an Air Force computer
to Mindvox and left it there because of its great size, 3-4 megabytes.
Pryce paid for his Internet service with a fraudulent credit card number.
At the time, the investigators were unable to find out the name and
whereabouts of Kuji. A lead to an Australian underground bulletin board
system yielded nothing.</P>

<P>On June 23 of 1996, Reuters reported that Matthew Bevan had been
arrested and also charged in connection with the 1994 Air Force break-ins
in Rome.</P>

<P>Bevan was found in the same low-tech manner as Pryce. His phone number
was eventually lifted by Scotland Yard from Pryce's seized PC. "Had it not
been for Scotland Yard, the relatively innocuous Pryce and Bevan would
never have been found and the U.S. Senate would still be hearing about
cyberterrorists from faraway lands," wrote the Guardian's reporter.</P>

<P>Lacking much evidence for conspiratorial computer-waged
campaigns of terror and chaos against the U.S., the makers of Congressional
reports nevertheless resorted to telling the same story over and over in
1996, three times in the space of the hearings on the subject.</P>

<P>As a result, Pryce and Bevan appeared in "Security in Cyberspace" and
twice in Government Accounting Office reports AIMD-96-84 and T-AIMD96-92
in 1996, which were essentially rewritten versions of the former with
additional editorializing.</P>

<P>Jack Brock, the author of these now famous GAO reports on hacker
intrusions at the Department of Defense wrote, ". . . Air Force officials
told us that at least one of the hackers [of Rome Labs] may have been
working for a foreign country interested in obtaining military research
data or areas in which the Air Force was conducting advanced
research."</P>

<P>This was not even close to the truth.</P>

<P><I>[Alert Crypt Newsletter readers will recall Mr. Brock was a
nominee in the 1996 Computer Virus Hysteria Awards.]</I></P>

<P>But what were Bevan and Pryce really after?</P>

<P>Not Air Force advanced research! Unless . . . you are one of those
who are convinced the U.S. military is really hiding a flying saucer
at Area 51 in Nevada.  According to the Guardian account, Matthew
Bevan was interested in little but gathering evidence confirming
that Area 51 was a secret hangar for captured alien spacecraft.</P>

<P>The Guardian news report was also extremely critical of Air Force
computer scientist Kevin Ziese.</P>

<P>Ziese, said the Guardian, "led a six-strong team [from San Antonio]
whose members, or so he told Fortune magazine, slept under their desks
for three weeks, hacking backwards until Pryce was arrested."</P>

<P>"Since then, Ziese has hit the US lecture circuit and [privatized]
his infowar business. As the WheelGroup corporation of San Antonio, he
now sells friendly hacking services to top U.S. corporations," reported
the Guardian.</P>

<P>However, while the Guardian was accurate in its assessment of the
trivial menace of Bevan and Pryce, it was off in its characterization
of Ziese, missing the real target -- investigators from AFOSI and the
authors of the Gelber/Christy report, according to information
supplied in interviews with Ziese.</P>  

<P>Ziese commented to Crypt Newsletter that he "[had] not hit the lecture 
circuit." He added that he was amused by the content of the article in 
the Guardian and that "to date, no one has ever asked me even one question 
-- beyond my initial deposition to New Scotland Yard in 1996 --
regarding the Rome Lab case!"</P>

<P>Digging more deeply into the story, the evidence gathered on
the Rome Labs break-in can be separated into two distinct classes.
"The first," said Ziese," [was] the deposition I gave sometime in 
and about May of 1996 to New Scotland Yard." The second is the 
same shopworn story the "extremely incompetent criminal investigators 
had gathered originally," he added.</P>

<P>It was the investigators from the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations, not the group of computer scientists from the Air Force's 
Information Warfare Center in San Antonio -- which Ziese led --
who peddled the Rome Labs break-in as evidence of international 
spying.</P>

<P>"Unbeknownst to the public at large, we had a very complete set of 
tools [and a] chronology," said Ziese. "It was the criminal 
investigators who tied our hands, lost critical pieces of data and
refused to allow us to testify/discuss the case. "They wanted to make 
a mountain out of a molehill."</P>  

<P>In this, they were successful.</P>

<P>". . . it was incompetent criminal investigators who saw a spy under 
every rock," Ziese continued, "not the computer scientists I brought
with me to Rome." AFOSI was responsible for the "hogwash that has been 
published to date about the Rome Lab attacks."</P>

<P>By the English account, the evidence submitted by the U.S. military 
investigative team was almost worthless: "[E-mails] of edited files 
that had been relayed to Ziese and others."</P>

<P>A desire for secrecy also backfired on the Air Force. In May
of this year, the Air Force declined to allow Bevan's defense to look 
at the test programs they claimed to have used to monitor his 
intrusions and " . . . having set traps to catch hackers, [the Air Force] 
neglected to produce before and after file dumps of the target 
computers."</P>

<P>The result was: "In the end, all the Americans handed over was patchy 
and circumstantial evidence that their computers had been hacked from 
Britain."</P>

<P>In March of this year, Richard Pryce -- now 19 -- was fined 1,200 pounds
for offenses related to unauthorized access in connection with the 
break-ins at Rome Labs.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<P><I>In sort of related news:</I></P>

<P>About the same time the wheels were coming off the Rome Labs
myth, a similar fate was being meted out to the hoary tale of
electromagnetic pulse gun attacks on banks in the United
Kingdom.</P>

<P>Alert Crypt Newsletter readers already know the publication
has dissed the legend of the non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse 
(HERF, microwave, radio frequency) gun as the chupacabras of
cyberspace for the last two years.</P>

<P>On December 4, a British journalist for TechWeb dubbed
them the same.</P> 

<P>These stories are nonsense, said Michael Corcoran of Britain's
Defense Evaluation and Research Agency, for TechWeb.
"There are no radio-frequency weapons out there that anyone is in a
position to use against banks." Corcoran then waffled for the
publication and equivocated that they might be sometime in the 
future.</P>

<P>
<P>CRETINS IN KGB & THE US MILITARY AND THE WASTE OF TIME  
DEVELOPING COMPUTER VIRUSES AS WEAPONS</P>

<P>Late November saw a brief report on computer viruses as weapons
inspired by NBC News' correspondent Robert Windrem's recovery of
a declassified copy of a report named "Nonlethal Information Effectors
Worldwide."  In it, the KGB was said to be developing computer
viruses for use as weapons as early as 1991.  In addition, the
Cuban Military Intelligence Directive spent the, ah, princely
sum of $5,000 for collection of open source information on computer
viruses.</P>

<P>Superficially, the news appears menacing.  However, without
context intelligence is meaningless.</P>

<P>You see, the U.S. military was in the same game.  And it would
be naive to assume the Russians and Cubans didn't notice.</P>

<P>The U.S. Army Center for Signals Warfare solicited for computer 
virus developers in the open literature in 1991. Army rep Bob Hein
said of the solicitation, "This is the Army. We're in the weapons
business." The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and Technology Review 
magazines both covered the call briefly but the announcement was 
common knowledge in computer security circles, even sparking a brief 
debate on the Usenet.</P> 

<P>So why did the Army want computer viruses?  Not to study
them because computer viruses weren't that hard to find at the time.  
There were already two books in print that included complete source 
code to them. (Indeed, the author of one of the books, Mark Ludwig,
has also commented that he developed computer viruses for the
American military around the same time.) However, the 
truth be told, it wasn't even necessary to purchase such a book.  Live 
virus samples and the source code to them were available on private BBSes
throughout the U.S. and in a number of foreign countries, including
a handful in the Soviet sphere.</P>

<P>By 1993 the U.S. Department of Treasury's Automated Information
Systems Security Branch bulletin board system even had computer virus 
source code and virus-making kits on it for examination by callers, usually 
computer security types. However, the BBS was open to anyone, even 
overseas callers.  The idea was to grant access to those who 
needed it most -- institutional and corporate information technology 
workers -- the same types of people who were <I>least</I> likely to dive 
into the warren of underground BBSes looking for virus samples. To say this 
was a controversial idea would be understating the case. The system 
came under increasing scrutiny and eventually the section of it devoted 
to hacker tools and malicious code was closed.</P> 

<P>What is remarkable is that it would be classified information --
unless purely to protect sources -- that the Cubans spent even as much 
as $5,000 trying to secure computer viruses. Even by the miserly 
standards of the computer underground, $5,000 was the equivalent of
buying a pig-in-a-poke and a strong indicator that intelligence 
analysts were presenting material out of context or those directing 
such a program were close to incompetent. Virus-writers and collectors 
in American were selling thousands of computer viruses on diskette 
collections for much less -- the going price was usually around $100 -- 
through the early part of the decade.  Many such collections went 
overseas. Others were imported in a brisk electronic trade. Often, a 
collection selling for $100 one day, would be given away for free the 
next. Most could be had by calling BBSes maintained by various computer 
virus salesmen. The expenses in an operation aimed at collecting 
computer viruses would be incurred from long distance tolls. Today, 
with the same collections on assorted Internet hosts worldwide, even 
that minimal cost has fallen by the wayside.</P>

<P>In 1997, it is only surprising that people in the intelligence
apparatus at one time considered this type of information worthy
of classification.  It was only eye-opening to people who don't know 
about the history of computer viruses.  And since there are now 
thousands of computer viruses, it's not hard to find Websites that
offer sizeable collections of them to anyone who happens along.</P>

<P>However, by 1992 there was already a noticeable load of computer virus
infections on government, military and corporate computers at
any one time.  How would one have distinguished an attack from Cuba
or the KGB from such noise? And further, how would any such organization
deploying computer viruses know it had achieved something, or any kind 
of effect, before its viruses were eliminated?</P> 

<P>From a technical standpoint, this is so simply because viruses don't 
make good weapons.  By definition they're unguided and the spread of 
them is largely unpredictable once out of the hands of the people who 
develop them. There have always been trivial attempts (the programmers,
typically, would call them <I>sophisticated</I>) to design viruses that 
are guided or controlled in some manner. Such examples
are notable only for the spectacular mistakes often coded into them.</P>  

<P>It is easy to imagine our own military or a foreign power 
with a bunch of secretive kooks releasing computer viruses in an 
information warfare attack becoming even more a victim than the 
intended target. Viruses easily cross borders and typically don't 
distinguish between the PCs they infect. They are not much like 
the computer viruses depicted in movies or science fiction novels:
dependable workhorses that have an anthropomorphic quality even
as they go about crashing the villain's or the hero's network.</P> 

<P>So, the KGB employed computer virus writers in 1991? Big deal. 
There were already pro bono virus writers in Russia, as there were in 
the U.S.</P>

THE FABULOUS FURRY FREAK BROTHERS AND HUDSON INSTITUTE INFO-WAR
RESEARCH

Crypt:  
  
Having read Mary C. Fitzgerald's comments in Crypt Newsletter 45, I am 
reminded of the fable about the emperor's new clothes.  Obviously, the 
fabric of her info-war paper is of too high a quality to be appreciated 
by such unrefined characters as you and I.

But it reminds me even more of this Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers tale.  

The DEA has big bucks to blow, so Norbert the Nark is given $800,000 to 
get anti-drug consultants at the neighborhood level.  Fat Freddy gets 
wind of this and becomes an expert on all drugs, including one called
"squeak."  Freddy finagles Norbert into financing an anti-"squeak" 
campaign.  He does this so well that he is given  awards and political 
consideration for his success in stamping out "squeak," even though 
there is no such thing.  Freddy's friends Phineas and Freewheeling 
Frank destroy his political ambitions by breaking into an awards ceremony 
and pointing out there are no laws against "squeak."  They make big 
bucks by selling everybody powdered sugar in the guise of "squeak." 
(Norbert gets a 1000 hits of LSD mixed with elephant laxative!).  

Too bad Mary C. Fitzgerald's story can't end the same way!

IMAN DE EXCREMENTO: PLAGUED BY MACRO VIRUS _AND_ HOAX INFECTIONS  

Crypt:

The NASA computer virus infection was caused by the SWLAB.G macro virus.  
Norton Anti-virus, NASA JSC's -- Jack Garman's -- anti-virus of choice, 
could have detected and stopped it if we had updated the definition files. 
The primary result of the episode is that Microsoft's SMS -- another 
Garman winner -- now updates the definitions for you on machine start up.  
A secondary result was an unfortunate blizzard of e-mails warning of Join 
the Crew and the usual virus hoaxes followed by still another blizzard of 
managerial-type lecturing on viruses. St. Dogbert exorcising the demons 
of stupidity would have been more useful.

Unfortunately, I'm a SAICer, sold to them by Lockheed-Martin after a 
George Abbey threat, but I think I have less respect for them than you 
do.

Keep up the good work,

PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC SECRET AGENT IN US ARMY ENCHANTED BY
GULF WAR VIRUS HOAX

Crypt:

For whatever it may be worth, I can positively identify one 
person taking credit for one of the flavors of the Gulf War virus 
hoax.

Staff Sergeant X -- use whatever pseudonym you like -- worked for 
me during my recent stint as the chief information officer of a small 
Army hospital. X had been transferred from Korea to the U.S. to undergo 
a medical review board. The Army was to decide if his heatlh was 
adequate to allow him to remain on active duty. 

Since X seemed PC literate, the hospital's Medical Hold Division assigned 
him to my Information Management Division to help augment my meager 
technical staff.

X was very sharp with basic PC repair and claimed to be experienced
in Netware 3.X administration. In fact, after a few months of generic PC
work, his claims went from impressive to ludicrous:

He claimed to have started his Federal career as a "secret agent"
for the NSA and, later, the DEA.

He claimed to have been part of the "secret military team" that
wrote and deployed the virus that took out the Iraqi air defense alert
system.

He claimed that a U.S. "attack virus" that he worked on was
designed to hide in "any computer's VRAM, regardless of platform" and
cause a buildup of electricity that resulted in a lethal
explosion.

Sound familiar?

Mind you, he wasn't re-telling tales found in the mail. He insisted --
quite seriously -- that he was responsible for it all.

It took a while for to catch onto it because he'd leak anecdotes to
different employees at different times,  inserting them into
conversations where they fit with the topic. 

Of my staff of fourteen, half weren't computer savvy at all
but X limited his bragging to the system administrators and
technicians, anyway. Ironically, THEY bought his stories
because they were all Civil Service civilians and were perfectly
willing to believe that the military and intelligence communities
were capable of anything. He was wearing a uniform,
after all . . .

My only other military staff members were a brand-new lieutenant
-- who meant well, but had no clue whatsoever -- and a sly old
Chief Warrant Officer who didn't believe a word the man said -- and
didn't care.

About eight months into his tour with our department, he wandered
into a senior colonel's office and casually mentioned that one of my 
system administrators was spying on his "secret dossier at the NSA." 
Then he suggested that the NSA had authorized him to assassinate the 
co-worker to cover up the "intrusion."

The modern Army is more tolerant of individual idiosyncracies than it
used to be, but it ain't that tolerant.

X was quickly run through the psych mill and pronounced a "paranoid
schizophrenic living in a complete fantasy world." The examining doctor
went on to suggest that X was probably harmless so long as you
didn't question his delusions.

While I don't believe that he or anyone else actually did anything like
what he took credit for, I suspect that he's a good example of a 
continuing catalyst for spreading these types of stories. 

Last I heard, the hospital had gotten so shorthanded, X
was back at work doing PC repair. My money says that by Christmas
he'll have claimed credit for the Ronco Pocket Fisherman and
the UN's "secret black helicopters."
