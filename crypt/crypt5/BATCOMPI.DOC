     BATCOMPI compiles a batch file into a stand-alone .COM file.  
     In general, .COM files produced in this manner run several times 
     faster than the equivalent .BAT file and the longer the file, the 
     greater the difference in speed.  If BATCOMPI encounters an error
     when compiling the file, it will notify you with an error message 
     and point out the line in which the error is found.

     To convert the test file, ASM.BAT, which activates the assembly of 
     the designated assembly source listing by the a86 assembler, type:

                       BATCOMPI ASM.BAT <enter>

     If BATCOMPI and the .BAT file are not in the same directory, include 
     the path in the command statement.

     If you liked BATCOMPI, know that it's free.  Since there are quite 
     a load of good public domain utilities floating around just like it, I
     see no point in deluding myself that it's worth much.  However, 
     if you'd like to see more from time to time, drop me a line at:
