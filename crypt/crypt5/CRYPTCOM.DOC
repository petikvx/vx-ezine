General notes to the Nowhere Utilities 2.0 CRYPTCOM program included in this
issue of the Crypt Newsletter. Used with permission from Nowhere Man. 
-------------

     The following applies to all of the  Nowhere  Utilities:  all  will
give  a  command  summary  if  "/?" is given as the first parameter; all
utilities preserve file date, time,  and  attributes,  unless  they  are
specifically  meant  to  change  them (FIXATTR and FIXTIME in specific);
all utilities will work on read-only files  (they  automatically  remove
the  attribute  if  any  writing needs to be performed and reset it when
finished. All of the utilities are supplied in .COM format for fast load
times, too);  and all the programs are written entirely in  Borland  C++
v3.0  using the tiny memory model (needed to create .COM files), and all
were written by myself, Nowhere Man, with some suggestions and  comments
provided  by  friends, especially Rigor Mortis, Leeking Virus, and Guido
Sanchez. Thanks guys. Now, on with the description...

CRYPTCOM
--------

     CRYPTCOM is handy utility that allows you  to  encrypt  .COM  files
but   still  leave  them  executable.  To  invoke  CRYPTCOM,  just  type
"CRYPTCOM" followed by one or more  files  that  you  wish  to  protect;
wildcards  are  allowed,  and the ".COM" extension is assumed if none is
given. They key is chosen by CRYPTCOM automatically, so you  don't  need
to  supply  one.  This program works by encrypting your .COM program and
adding some decryption code to the end. The file decrypts itself in  RAM
at  run-time,  leaving  the actual file unaltered with each execution of
the encrypted program. Suggested use:  encrypting  virii  to  slip  past
virus  scanners.  It's  rather  obvious what to do: just run CRYPTCOM on
the virus. It is now unscannable, and it still runs  normally.  However,
just  like  the  PKLITE  trick  of  old,  all subsequent infections will
contain the original virus, so basically, this just gets  the  virus  in
the  front door. Unlike PKLITE, though, no scanner (as of yet, at least)
can decrypt a CRYPTCOMed file and scan it, so you don't  have  to  worry
about  recent versions of SCAN catching you. (You can also use NOLZEXE, 
included with the complete Nowhere Utilities 2.0, for another tactic.)

Closing comments
----------------

          The complete Nowhere Utilities 2.0, in addition to CRYPTCOM,
includes the following programs:

          CIPHER - a quick and handy encryption tool for those occasions
          when data should be kept from prying eyes.

          DBGSCRPT - converts binary files to DEBUG scripts, handy for
          including viruses and special programs in your e-mail or
          electronic publications. The DEBUG scripts in the Crypt Newsletter
          were generated using DBGSCRPT.

          DECRYPT - will decrypt data encrypted by most 8-bit or 16-bit 
          encryption scheme, usually in under 10 seconds!

          FAKEWARE - will plant your virus in a custom set of bogus
          "0-30 day ware" game or utility files, complete with ZIPnote
          and .NFO file from a famous cracking group.
          Give that 'k-rad elite ware' board your virus gift
          that keeps on giving in just the right archive, with FAKEWARE.

          FAKEFILE - create single FAKEFILE's when FAKEWARE is too much. 
          
          RESIZE - utility for resizing any file. It has many uses. 
          
          FIXTIME - "touch" up the date/time stamps on your proprietary
          files

          FIXATTR - quickly change the file attributes on any of your
          proprietary files

          REPLACE - replace an attractive utility or game executable
          with the virus (or any other file) of your choice. REPLACE
          mimics the outward characteristics of the 'replaced' file
          for optimium effect.
          
          WIPE - eliminates sensitive date from your drive, fast!

          USER2TXT - converts binary Telegard and X-Ot-Icks BBS user 
          files to text files containing user names and passwords.

          NOLZEXE - removes those annoying banners from proprietary files
          compressed by PKLite, etc.

          As  you  can see, the Nowhere Utilities are very powerful, but
they also can be abused --  DON'T.  I  intended  for  the  entire  virus
community  to  benefit  from  these,  not for some losers to abuse them.
Other than that little warning, I heartily encourage you  to  experiment
with  the  utilities,  to  use  them in new and interesting ways (if you
find a novel use for a utility, let me know so I can mention it  in  the
next version). Enjoy them.

          As  usual, greets go out to Rock Steady, Rigor Mortis, Leeking
Virus and Murdak, all [NuKE] and SCP members and  sites,  Phalcon/SKISM,
and  all virus-writers everywhere. Thanks to anyone else who I forgot to
mention; your input into this  project  is  still  greatly  appreciated,
even if I do forget a name here and there.
          If   anyone   has  any  questions,  comments,  complaints,  or
suggestions about this or any other fine product  from  Nowhere  Man  or
[NuKE],  I  can be reached at The Hell Pit and FreeMatrix, both official
U.S. distribution sites for [NuKE]. I  also  monitor  most  Chicago-area
networks,  as  well  as NuKENet, Swashnet, CyberCrime International, P/S
Net, and FidoNet; responses to my products may  be  posted  there  also.
Once again, so long, and happy virusing.
