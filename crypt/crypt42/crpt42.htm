<P>HOISTED ON THE PETARD OF PENPAL</P>


<P>In an astonishing gaffe, government intelligence experts writing
for the Moynihan Commission's recent "Report . . . on Protecting
and Reducing Government Secrecy" reveal they've been hooked on one
of the Internet's ubiquitous e-mail computer virus hoaxes
known as "Penpal Greetings"!</P>

<P>In a boldly displayed boxed-out quote (page 109) in a part of the
report entitled "Information Age Insecurity" authors of the report
proclaim:</P>

<P>"Friendly Greetings?</P>

<P>"One company whose officials met with the Commission warned its
employees against reading an e-mail entitled Penpal Greetings.
Although the message appeared to be a friendly letter, it
contained a virus that could infect the hard drive and destroy all
data present. The virus was self-replicating, which meant that
once the message was read, it would automatically forward itself
to any e-mail address stored in the recipients in-box."</P>

<P>The Penpal joke is one in half-a-dozen or so permutations spun
off the well-known GoodTimes e-mail virus hoax.  Variations on
GoodTimes have appeared at a steady rate over the past couple
years. Real computer security experts -- as opposed to the
Moynihan commission's -- now occasionally worry in the press that
they spend more time clearing up confusion created by such
tricks than destroying actual computer viruses.</P>

<P>The report's authors come from what is known as "the Moynihan
commission," a group of heavy Congressional and intelligence
agency hitters tasked with critiquing and assessing the Byzantine
maze of classification and secrecy regulation currently embraced by
the U.S. government. The commission also devoted significant print
space to the topic of information security and network intrusion.</P>

<P>Among the commission's members are its chairman, Daniel Moynihan;
vice-chairman Larry Combest, Jesse Helms, ex-CIA director John
Deutch and Martin Faga, now at a MITRE Corporation facility in McLean,
Virginia, but formerly a head of the super-secret, spy satellite-flying
National Reconnaissance Office.</P>

<P>The part of the commission's report dealing with "Information Age
Insecurity" merits much more comment.  But in light of the report's
contamination by the Penpal virus hoax, two paragraphs from the March 4
treatise become unintentionally hilarious:</P>

<P>"Traditionally, computer security focuses on containing the effects of
malicious users or malicious programs. As programs become more complex,
an additional threat arises: _malicious data_ [Crypt Newsletter emphasis
added] . . . In general, the outlook is depressing: as the economic
incentives increase, these vulnerabilities are likely to be
exploited more frequently.</P>

<P>---W. Olin Sibert, 19th National Information Systems Security
Conference (October 1996)"</P>

<P>And,</P>

<P>"Inspector General offices, with few exceptions, lack the personnel,
skills, and resources to address and oversee information systems
security within their respective agencies. The President cannot turn to
an Information General and ask how U.S. investments in information
technology are being protected from the latest viruses, terrorists, or
hackers."</P>

<P>Got that right, sirs.</P>

<P>--------------------</P>

<P>Notes: Other authors of the commission report include Maurice
Sonnenberg, a member of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board; John Podesta, a White House Deputy Chief of Staff and
formerly a visiting professor at Georgetown University's Cyberlaw
Center; Ellen Hume, a media critic for CNN's "Reliable Sources"
and former reporter for the Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times;
and Alison Fortier, a former National Security Council staffer and
current director of Missile Defense Programs in a Washington,
D.C.-based arm of Lockheed Martin.</P>

<P>The Penpal Greetings hoax appeared in November of 1996 which would
seem to indicate the section of the report containing it was not written
until a month or so before the report's publication on March 4 of
this year.</P>

<P>Unsurprisingly, much of the report appears to be written by staff
members for the commission chairmen.  An initial phone call to
the commission was answered by a staffer who declined to name the
author of the part of the report carrying the Penpal hoax. The
staffer did, however, mention he would forward the information to
the author.  And he was as good as his word.  The following week,
Crypt Newsletter was told to get in touch with Alison Fortier
by way of Jacques Rondeau, a U.S. Air Force colonel who served as
a commission staff director and was instrumental in writing the
chapter on "computer insecurity."</P>

<P>Fortier was surprised by the information that Penpal Greetings
was a hoax and could shed no light on the peer-review process that
went into verifying items included as examples in the report.  She
said the process involved readings of the material by staffers to
the commissioners.  Examples were presented and this was one of
the ones that was picked, apparently because it sounded good.</P>

<P>At first, Fortier argued that Penpal Greetings, as an example,
was difficult to distinguish from the truth. Indeed, Fortier wasn't
even convinced it wasn't a real virus. And this demonstrates the thorny
problem that arises when hoaxes work their way into the public
record at a very high level of authority: Simply, there is a great
reluctance to accept that they ARE rubbish, after the fact, because the
hearsay has come from multiple, supposedly authoritative, sources.</P>

<P>Crypt Newsletter then told Fortier that verification of whether or
not Penpal was bogus could have been accomplished by spending five
minutes of time on any of the Internet search engines and using it
as a keyword ("Penpal Greetings" returns numerous cites indicating
it is a hoax) and the Moynihan commissioner backed off on insistence
that it might still be real.</P>

<P>"It's unfortunate that this error occurred because it can interfere
with the recommendations of the commission, which are still valid,"
Fortier said.  "When policy meets science -- it's always an imperfect
match."</P>

<P>Crypt Newsletter also queried commissioner and ex-NRO director Martin
Faga. "I've been aware of the error since shortly after
publication of the report, but I'm not familiar with the background," Faga
told Crypt.</P>

<P>Commissioner Ellen Hume was also at a loss as to how Penpal Greetings
had arrived in the report.</P>

<P>Commission staff director Eric Biel had more to say on the subject in a
letter to Crypt Newsletter dated April 24. In it, Biel wrote: "I am
very frustrated that we failed to get our information correct in
this regard; as you note, the error only adds to the confusion
concerning a very complicated set of security issues.  You are quite
right when you indicate this portion of the report was added late
in the day.  We had been urged to provide some anecdotes to complement
the narrative text; this example thus was added to give greater
emphasis to the points already being described . . . Obviously, there
was not an adequate fact-checking and verification process with
respect to the Penpal information."</P>

<P>Biel added that he was still confident of "the soundness of [the
report's] findings and recommendations, including [those in the chapter
'Information Age Insecurity.']"</P>

<P>Go ahead, contact the Moynihan Secrecy Commission at 202-776-8727
and verify for them that Penpal Greetings is a hoax. After all, it's your
money, too.  But hurry, they're moving out of the office by the middle
of the month.</P>

<P>Acknowledgment: A copy of the Moynihan Commission report is mirrored
on the Federation of American Scientists' Website. Without FAS' timely
and much appreciated efforts to make government reports and documents
of strategic interest freely available to an Internet readership, Crypt
Newsletter's rapid tracing of the travel of the Penpal hoax into the
commission's record might not have been possible.</P>

<P>WE ARE THE ENEMY: BUNKER MENTALITY IN USAF INFO-WAR KOOKS</P>

<P>Just in case you've harbored the suspicion that Crypt Newsletter
exaggerates the outright paranoia now gripping portions of the
United States military with regards to the Internet, in this
issue I've excerpted substantial portions of an article which
appeared in a July 1996 issue of Intercom, an electronic
publication published on a Web server out of Scott Air Force Base in
Illinois. Intercom is a good source of US Air Force orthodoxy on the
topic of information technology as it pertains to members of the
service.</P>

<P>In this article, the information airmen of Goodfellow AFB,
Texas, tell us they're already under attack.  Computer viruses,
say soldiers, are continuously assaulting the base, leaving it
in essentially a continual state of information war.  While the
article may appear reasonable to the principals who commissioned it,
publishing it on the Internet has only served to reinforce the
notion that some "info-warriors" in the U.S. military are starkly
paranoid nutcases.</P>

<P>It's a whole new realm of warfare and you're no longer safe at work
or at home," said Lieutenant Randy Tullis, for Intercom.</P>

<P>"As evidence of the increase in information warfare activity,
communications officials at Goodfellow have logged 12 incidents of
computer viruses in less than four months this year," said
Sgt. Michael Minick.</P>

<P>The Intercom feature continues, "In all of 1995,
[Goodfellow] handled 14 cases [of computer virus infection.]"</P>

<P>"While viruses are not an all-out war waged against the base with
weapons of mass destruction, the results can be devastating," states
the article, rather balefully.</P>

<P>"Information warriors will try to deal heavy blows in future wars,
and Goodfellow and its 315th Training Squadron is at the forefront in
training defenders against these warriors," the article says.</P>

<P>"The most popular aspect of [information war] is the process of
attacking and protecting computer-based and communication information
networks," said Goodfellow AFB's Captain Tim Hall.</P>

<P>Hall had also advertised on the Internet in mid-November 1996 for
an info-war instructor at Goodfellow.  The job description called
for a captain's rank to "[Create and develop] infowar curricula for all
new USAF Intelligence personnel;  Supervise IW Lab development, student
training, infowar instructional methods and infowar exercises."</P>

<P>"Some attacks are by people who unintentionally access networks and
others are by those bent on destroying government computer data
through use of devastating viruses and other means," said Hall.</P>

<P>"Students also learn how other countries such as Russia, China and
France plan to conduct [information warfare] operations," said Hall.</P>

<P>"Indeed," said Crypt Newsletter.</P>

<P>It's war -- war against hackers, say the information soldiers of
Goodfellow.</P>

<P>Instruction courses at the base are designed to inculcate "basic
awareness in the defensive skills needed to recognize and defeat
information warriors, <I>commonly called computer hackers</I>," Hall
said for Intercom.</P>

<P>Goodfellow is stepping up efforts to train its information warriors.
"We are going to propose Team Goodfellow build an advanced [information
warfare] course," said another soldier. "It will teach offensive and
defensive concepts in a classroom and hands-on training in a lab
environment," which is a tricky way of saying that soldiers
think hacking the hackers, or whoever they think might be launching
info-war attacks, is a savvy idea.</P>

<P>Long-time Crypt Newsletter readers probably can't help but
recognize trenchant similarities between the quote of Goodfellow
info-warriors and examples of the paranoid rantings found sprinkled
through the writings of teenager-composed 'zines from the computer
underground ca. 1992.</P>

<P>We'll kick them off Internet Relay Chat.  They'll never get
channel ops on our watch.  Yeah, that's the ticket.</P>

<P>----------------</P>

<P>Additional color: Alan Dunkin promptly wrote to Crypt Newsletter
with some additional local commentary on the environment in which
<I>Team Goodfellow</I> operates. He speculates on possible causes
of institutional paranoia.</P>

<P>"My freshman year straight out of high school I decided to go out of
town and went to Angelo State University, in San Angelo, Texas," writes
Dunkin.  "I'm  not sure why, but Angelo State had a good music program and
a [supposedly] decent computer science program, which was my major back
then. And I decided to go the 300 miles or so [from Dallas] and see what
it was like."</P>

<P>"The USAF runs classes right out of Angelo State and, of course, I'd
also see training aircraft from Goodfellow, which is based in San
Angelo, all the time. I also knew students who were either in ROTC or knew
someone inside of Goodfellow.</P>

<P>"During and after I left, I kept track of Goodfellow throughout the years,
and that base has been the center of some strange happenings which might
explain a lot of broad paranoia about that place:</P>

<pre>
* In 1993 I was told that Goodfellow was the center of intelligence
  training in the USAF, and computer technology.  I really didn't believe
  it, and still don't -- to an extent.

* A high ranking officer was caught distributing child pornography
  throughout the BBSes in the San Angelo area, though apparently not
  from the base itself.

* Angelo State was supposed to be one of the top notch computer
  science schools in the entire "Key" country -- west-central Texas --
  although the its facilities were fairly pitiful and the labs were
  constantly infected by viruses. (One of which I nearly transmitted on
  diskette to Jim Thomas at NIU by mistake.) [The viruses] supposedly
  got spread by the ROTC students who worked on Goodfellow machines.
  I could never confirm this though.

* There are a lot of pranksters and techno-weenies at Angelo State, many
  whom I knew created viruses for the express purpose of destroying
  information, records, etc., on school computers.  I never heard of any
  successes (in such a relatively small town and university things like
  this spread  quickly via word-of-mouth) but the air force base systems
  would have been a tempting target [for these types].

</pre>

<P>"I think the combination of incidents, the apparent breaching of
Goodfellow AFB security -- which was weak to begin with, the numerous
technological problems that surrounded Goodfellow and the jump on the
technology bandwagon, may have contributed to the feeling
of distinct paranoia at Goodfellow as described by Crypt.  I'm not really
surprised. In 1993 during my Freshman year they had hardly heard of the
Internet in San Angelo, while I petitioned in the local newspaper for
access. Supposedly school access would be attempted within 2 years, an
appalling [lag] for a school -- and city -- that likened itself to be a
technological mecca in the west Texas scrublands."</P>

<P>Dunkin also commented one searing case in 1995 involving base security.
Tracy McBride, a 19-year old servicewoman, was abducted from a
Goodfellow laundry and later found dead under a highway bridge in an
adjacent county.  Her murderer, an out-of-state man, was captured.</P>

<P>Paranoid or not, for a long time Goodfellow has been a training school
for some air force intelligence activities. From a biographical sketch
of the base:</P>

<P>"In 1958, Goodfellow's mission became the training of Air Force
personnel in the advanced cryptologic skills that the Security Service
required at installations worldwide.  Eight years later, in 1966, the
mission expanded further to include joint-service training in these
same skills for Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel.</P>

<P>"[By the 80's] senior intelligence personnel had . . . begun
seriously to contemplate the consolidation of all Air Force-managed
intelligence training to one location.  The site selected for intelligence
training consolidation was Goodfellow, and the base was designated a
Technical Training Center in 1985. During the next three years, ITC
brought to Goodfellow advanced imagery training from Offutt AFB, Nebraska,
electronic intelligence operations training from Keesler AFB, Mississippi,
and targeting, intelligence applications, and general intelligence training
from Lowry AFB, Colorado."</P>

<P>Not all USAF intelligence training is conducted at Goodfellow.  However,
a sampling of the <I>Top Secret</I> courses taught at the base are:</P>

<pre>

<P>EX-VIRUS WRITER CLINT HAINES DIES OF OVERDOSE AT 21</P>


<P>Long-time readers of Crypt Newsletter will be astonished to hear
death -- due to heroin overdose -- came to the famous Australian
virus-writer Clint Haines on his twenty-first birthday, April
10.  He was from Brisbane.</P>

<P>Writing in the Usenet comp.virus newsgroup On April 19, Rod Fewster, a
moderator of one of the Fidonet's virus information newsfeeds and
one who knew Haines, said:</P>

<P>"Clinton Haines, who earned his place in virus-writing history at the age
of fifteen as Harry McBungus, became a household name in the virus world
by the time he was eighteen as Terminator-Z and TaLoN . . . [Haines]
gained widespread fame a couple of years ago with front-page newspaper
headlines yelling about how his No Frills virus had stopped the
Australian Taxation Office dead in its tracks for two days, and was
regarded by his peers as one of the <I>best</I> virus writers of all
time . . . [He] will be cremated tomorrow morning.</P>

<P>"Clint quit virus writing two years ago to concentrate on his university
studies and he had the intelligence to go a long way in his chosen field
of microbiology, but unfortunately being intelligent doesn't always give
you street smarts.</P>

<P>"Clinton Haines/Harry McBungus/Terminator-Z/TaLoN died from an overdose
of heroin . . . on his twenty-first birthday."</P>

<P>Haines' interest in controlled substances could be seen in frequent
posts to the Usenet where the University of Queensland student waxed
enthusiastically on topics ranging from the synthesis of LSD and
methamphetamines to his own experiences with Prozac. In April,
it all came off the rails, rendering him dead and an acquaintance
comatose.</P>

<P>For example, on the date-rape drug, rohypnol: ". . . a friend of mine
had 10 rohypnols and a 6-pack, woke up in the lockup with 25 stitches in his
head and a broken arm, and couldn't remember a single thing from the last
12 hours . . . turns out he was vandalizing a train seat and the security
guards beat the shit out of him . . . then he got off at the next station
only to try skateboarding and broke his arm."</P>

<P>On speed and LSD: ". . . I assure you people that LSD
and amphetamines are a rather wondrous combination, the ceaseless and
energetic progression of thought along a myriad gossamer threads of
abstract reality . . . throw nitrous on top of that and you have God mode
happening . . . thinking is simply a matter of choosing where you want
to go inside your mind and insight/thought rushes abound to the point of
not having enough time in which to follow every branch point . . . to
the point where your individual thought threads meld themselves into
higher denominations . . ."</P>

<P>Haines rambled wildly on his thrill at sniffing laughing
gas: ". . . nitrousing out in this state of mind can be <I>wicked</I>
because you go so far out on a mental limb . . . sometimes you get to
this point where everything becomes completely fluid, not in the physical
sense, but one can see, perceive, visualize, etc., every ramification of
everything that goes on in the particular mental environment you
construct . . . including, say, the passage of a tennis ball under the
influence of gravity, or the evolution of an argument and the interplay
of multiple factors, even your own thought reasoning . . . when one
nitrouses out to a point of total thought fusion, and the concurrent
realization/visualization of an extended range of thought capabilities
occurs, one gets the rare chance to 'refit' aspects of one's mind, much
like getting into newly-washed clothes or something."</P>

<P>And, sadly, on heroin synthesis in a post on September 20, 1996:
"WARNING ---- MAKE SURE you cut the rock so produced down to NO
MORE than 30% purity -- otherwise you'll end up killing a whole
bunch of people . . street-grade heroin is usually in the range of
10-20%, maximum."</P>

<P>The Australian VLAD virus-writing group promptly published a
memorial virus to Haines, called "RIP Terminator Z," according to a
story by technology writer Julie Robotham in a piece published in the
April 29 edition of the Sydney Morning Herald.</P>

<P>Fewster commented to Crypt Newsletter, "[Clint Haines] had a bright
future ahead of him, and in my opinion could have done some good in the
world if he'd just kept his head together."</P>

<P>THE FAVORITE SLOGAN OF U.S. INFOWARRIORS</P>

<pre>
electronic Pearl Harbor (or "EPH"): a bromide popularized
by Alvin Toffler-types, ex-Cold War generals, assorted corporate
windbags and hack journalists, to name a few. EPH is
meant to signify a nebulous electronic doom looming over U.S.
computer networks. In the real world, it's a cue for the phrase
"Watch your wallet!" since those wielding it are usually doing
so in an attempt to convince taxpayers or consumers to fund
ill-defined and/or top secret projects said to be aimed at
protecting us from it.

                         --from the Crypt Newsletter "Joseph K"
                         Guide to Tech Terminology
</pre>

<P>"Electronic Pearl Harbor" and variations on it, Crypt Newsletter
has noticed, are now some of the most over used buzz-phrases in the
topic of computer security and information warfare.  Using Internet
search engines, it is possible to quickly find over 500 citations
for the phrase in on-line news archives, military research papers and
press releases.</P>

<P>Paradoxically, overuse of the phrase has had quite the opposite
effect desired by those who unwittingly wield it. One can easily imagine
p.r. handlers coaching our leaders, generals and corporate salesmen
to not forget to say "electronic Pearl Harbor" at least one time just
before giving a speech or interview. Since it is a gold-plated cliche,
anyone with more sense than it takes to pour piss from a boot can use
it as an infallible detector of Chicken Little-like cyber-bull.
Paraphrased: Anyone still caught uttering <I>"electronic Pearl Harbor"</I>
in 1997 is either completely out of it or a used-car salesman/white-collar
crook of some type.</P>

<P>Here then, Crypt News presents for your amusement, a selection of the
unclothed emperors speaking of "electronic Pearl Harbor:</P>

<P>Twice in the May issue of WIRED magazine, both in John Carlin's
"Farewell to Arms."</p>

<P>1. "We will have a cyber equivalent of Pearl Harbor at some point, and
we do not want to wait for that wake-up call," attributed to former
U.S. Deputy Atty. General Jamie Gorelick.</P>

<P>2. "I-war can be the kind of neat, conceptually contained electronic
Pearl Harbor scenario that Washington scenarists like -- collapsing
power grids, a stock market software bomb, an electromagnetic pulse
that takes the phone system out."</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>Twice in Robert Minehart's tutorial on Information Warfare,
a course currently presented by the U.S. Army's training school in
Carlisle, PA. Minehart's bio refers to him as an NSA/CIA/DIA agent and
Visiting Professor of Information Warfare at Carlisle. Minehart
prefers "Information Pearl Harbor" to "electronic Pearl Harbor" but
as far as Crypt Newsletter is concerned, they're the same thing.</P>

<P>1. "So what would an effective Information Pearl Harbor look like?"</P>

<P>2. "The U.S. may find it difficult to use military force in response
to an Information Pearl Harbor-type attack."</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>Once by John Woodward, a mouthpiece for MITRE Corporation in McLean, VA,
in a long-winded 1997 company Website sales pitch for hiring MITRE expertise
in avoiding "electronic Pearl Harbor":</P>

<P>"It's MITRE's job to keep the information warfare equivalent of
[electronic] Pearl Harbor solely and exclusively in the realm of
simulation."</P>

<P>Also attributed to Woodward, "MITRE is the best source on information
warfare in the world."  Of course, how could it be otherwise?</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>"Electronic Pearl Harbor" was invoked three times by strategist
Martin Libicki, in "Defending Cyberspace and other Metaphors," a
paper on info-war published by the Pentagon-administered National
Defense University in Washington, D.C.  The paper appeared earlier
this year and Libicki uses the term "digital" in place of "electronic."</P>

<P>1."A strategic motive for a digital Pearl Harbor could be to dissuade
the United States from military operations (perhaps against the attacking
country) or to hinder their execution by disrupting mobilization,
deployment, or command and control.</P>

<P>2. "How much damage could a digital Pearl Harbor cause?"</P>

<P>3. "A more pertinent question than how much damage a digital Pearl
Harbor might cause is how well hackers attacks can delay, deny,
destroy, or disrupt military operations."</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>In the January 6, 1997 edition of the Wall Street Journal, reporter
Tom Ricks attributes Duane Andrews of Science Applications and the
Pentagon's Defense Science Board with:</P>

<P>"Warning of a possible 'electronic Pearl Harbor,' the task force
appointed by the Defense Science Board also said the Pentagon
should seek the legal authority to launch counterattacks against
hackers."</P>

<P>Keep in mind Science Applications, like MITRE Corporation, advertises
its skills in avoiding problems related to "electronic Pearl Harbor."</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>"We could be on the brink of an 'electronic Pearl Harbor' or an
'information Chernobyl' and not even know it."</P>

<P>This one was uttered by Frank Morgan, an Air Force Intelligence
Agency officer out of Kelly AFB, Texas, in an article for the September
1996 issue of Airman magazine entitled "Info Warriors!"</P>


<P>---------------</P>

<P>In Cybernautics Digest, Vol. 3, No. 7 (1996), "All's Not Quiet on the
Information Front":</P>


<P>"Pentagon officials fear an electronic Pearl Harbor: an attack which
could go undetected until it is too late."</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>"[John] Deutch favors center to avoid `electronic Pearl Harbor'
and [it] would not require hiring new personnel," showed up in
a July 1, 1996 story on Congressional testimony on the subject of
hackers and info-war. It appeared in Federal Computer Week.</P>

<P>If you've been following newspapers, sometimes it seemed as if
CIA-director Deutch spent most of 1996 talking about "electronic
Pearl Harbor," a remarkable feat from someone who could not distinguish
the PenPal Greetings Net virus hoax from reality.</P>

<P>And in the same story, a couple paragraphs on:</P>

<P>"I don't know whether we will face an electronic Pearl Harbor, but we
will have, I'm sure, some very unpleasant circumstances in this area," said
John Deutch.</P>


<P>---------------</P>

<P>"Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who chaired the hearing, raised the
issue of 'an electronic Pearl Harbor' against the 'national
information infrastructure,' and asked 'are we fully alerted to this
danger now?"</P>

<P>The above quote came from an article written by John Elliston
for something called "Dossier."  It, of course, also repeats
the Deutch "electronic Pearl Harbor" quote -- published by hundreds
around the country -- taken from the same July 1996 Congressional
hearings.</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>"We're facing an electronic Pearl Harbor," said Ronald Gove, a vice
president of Science Applications, at a 1995 National Computer Security
Association Info-war conference, as reported by a September '95 issue
of the Arizona Star.</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>"The Pentagon's New Nightmare: An Electronic Pearl Harbor" was the
title of a Neil Munro-penned editorial in the July 16, 1995 edition
of The Washington Post.</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>And in Alvin and Heidi Toffler's 1993 book entitled "War and Anti-War,"
"electronic Pearl Harbor" is said to be just waiting to happen. (Page 149
in a section entitled "Info-terror.")</P>

<P>Duane Andrews of Science Applications also makes an appearance in
the Toffler book, and similar to what he said in 1997, he says in "War
and Anti-War:" "Our information security is atrocious, our operation
[secrecy] is atrocious, our communications secrecy is atrocious."</P>

<P>MCAFEE'S MEDIA-ASSAULT TACTICS</P>

<pre>
A 1997 opinion piece by Rob Rosenberger (1st edition, 4/22/97)
  _________________________________________________________________
</pre>

<P>DID YOU KNOW McAfee Associates pays employees to find flaws in
competitors' products? This fact came to light when McAfee launched a
new volley of media assaults against Symantec and Dr. Solomon's
Software, two major rivals in the antivirus market.</P>

<P>In the first case, McAfee's beta-test division discovered an obscure
flaw in Symantec's Norton Utilities. Instead of notifying Symantec,
McAfee chose to notify only the media. They even wrote a blatant
demonstration program so Windows Sources magazine could include it as
part of a fear-inducing online story.</P>

<P>Symantec believes McAfee should have notified them instead of
helping the media write scary stories about a trivial flaw. Product
manager Tom Andrus told Associated Press: "We were taken aback that
they would go to the press, create something akin to a virus and then
basically show the world how to do that." Symantec also berated
Windows Sources for providing McAfee's code to any malicious hacker
who wanted it.</P>

<P>Editors pulled McAfee's blatant demo from the Windows Sources website
the next day. Symantec quickly released a software patch to calm the
nerves of frightened customers -- and paid PRNewswire to distribute an
extremely polite press release announcing the patch.</P>

<P>IN THE SECOND case, McAfee's beta-test division discovered a supposed
"cheat mode" in Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit. McAfee went on the
war path, paying PRNewswire to distribute a press release accusing
Solomon's of committing heinous crimes against humanity:</P>

<P>"The cheat mode can cause Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit to show
inflated virus detection results when the product is being reviewed
by trade publications or independent third party testing
organizations. McAfee has forwarded its evidence to the National
Computer Security Association . . ."</P>

<P>Solomon's struck back with a hilarious press release: "McAfee Pleads
with Dr Solomon's to Reduce Dr Solomon's Virus Detection Rate." They
proudly admit their "heuristic" function works exactly as described.
"The product given to reviewers is exactly the same product delivered
to customers . . . The technology is available to every user."</P>

<P>McAfee responded with another inflammatory press release claiming
Solomon's had engaged in a "disinformation campaign." In an incredible
twist, McAfee quoted Patricia Hoffman, "a well-respected independent
virus research[er] based in Santa Clara, Calif." Hmmm, McAfee
coincidentally bases its operations in Santa Clara, too. You can
discover a lot of interesting coincidences surrounding Hoffman &
McAfee, but let's not digress.</P>

<P>The National Computer Security Association stepped in at this point
with its own press release "reaffirm[ing] that Dr. Solomon's
Anti-Virus Toolkit meets stringent NCSA anti-virus product
certification standards." The heuristic function "did not and does not
affect the NCSA labs present or past certification testing." McAfee
Associates apparently gave up the fight at this point.</P>

<P>McAFEE'S MEDIA ASSAULTS stretch back to the 1980s when the press built
a sacrificial alter to founder John McAfee. Josh Quittner's definitive
expose in New York Newsday showed just how effectively McAfee
corrupted an all-too-willing media. Pamela Kane (then a competitor to
McAfee) also wrote an expose in her book, "V.I.R.U.S. Protection."</P>

<P>"Big John's" teachings continue to inspire employees long after his
departure from the company. A 1996 media campaign against Symantec
demanded no less than a worldwide recall of Norton AntiVirus, to which
Symantec issued a rather wimpy response.</P>

<P>Symantec's well-oiled propaganda machine doesn't smell like a rose
either, as Crypt Newsletter's exposes point out. Symantec shamelessly
exploit the media to gain free publicity; McAfee shamelessly exploits
the media as a weapon.</P>

<P>In another example from 1996, McAfee issued a press release
"extend[ing a] safety net to displaced Cheyenne customers" after
Computer Associates acquired the firm. "Displaced"? McAfee makes it
sound like Cheyenne got run over by a truck. Rather, Computer
Associates gave them access to a lucrative customer base and plenty of
cash for research & development.</P>

<P>Its tactic against Cheyenne seems even more odd when you realize
a competitor can use the same trick against them -- McAfee buys
companies on a regular basis. Indeed, they tried to purchase Cheyenne
first (right after acquiring a firm called Vycor). They've since
purchased a company called FSA and put in a bid for a Japanese
antivirus vendor.</P>

<P>A rival could use the same tactic against McAfee to increase
bottom-line revenues. Just ignore that pesky "ethics" issue standing
behind the curtain . . . </P>

<P>GRAHAM CLULEY, A virus researcher at Solomon's, called from his office
in Britain after the latest media attack subsided. "McAfee [is]
worried because we have heuristics for finding new file viruses and
they don't," he emphasized. "It's odd that a company which claims to
have such a large market share in the States should devote so much of
its time attacking competitors."</P>

<P>Odd? Not really. McAfee controls a huge share of the market, buys out
companies, takes over product lines, hires rivals' employees, doubles
its revenues on average every year -- yet they continue to slowly lose
total market share. McAfee slows the decline by generating negative
publicity for its rivals.</P>

<P>McAfee's percentage of the total customer base dwindles for (at least)
two important reasons. First, they evolved beyond a simple "antivirus
firm," venturing into the overall concept of computer security. McAfee
now sells antivirus software, Internet-based storage solutions, data
encryption packages, network audit tools . . . you can even buy
advertising space on their website.</P>

<P>Diversification is a big sword, but it's a two-edged sword. Small,
focused companies can easily upstage the behemoth. Consider EliaShim:
they released an intriguing antivirus software development kit last
year. Niche firms like Stiller Research (they focus on data integrity)
long offered solutions foreign to McAfee's product line.</P>

<P>Second, McAfee's market share slowly dwindles because every major
antivirus firm now offers its products as shareware. The "try before
you buy" approach gave McAfee unparalleled product exposure in the
1980s; it no longer makes them stand out today.</P>

<P>"YOU KNOW THE old saying: "if you can't beat 'em, beat 'em up." McAfee
long ago learned they could level the playing field faster if they
used a gun. A willing media supplies the bullets in order to satisfy
its fetish for virus-related news.</P>

<P>Who ultimately wins? PRNewswire. McAfee pays them to distribute
inflammatory press releases, competitors pay them to distribute
responses, and reporters pay them to get on the distribution list.</P>

<pre>
Addendum
========

DID SYMANTEC FINALLY READ MCAFEE'S MEDIA-ASSAULT HANDBOOK?

On 23 Apr 97, Symantec paid PRNewswire to distribute an eye-popping
press release accusing McAfee of "stealing code" from one of its
products. They filed a copyright infringement lawsuit demanding a U.S.
recall of McAfee's PC Medic software and all profits from its sale.
Symantec admitted it staffs a beta-test division (just like McAfee) to
dissect competitors' products: "close inspection through the use of
debugging tools shows that a critical section of code . . ."

No response yet from McAfee -- but rest assured, they'll pay
PRNewswire to distribute it.

<P>SPY PROF FIRES UP INFO-WAR TRAINING</P>

<P>With a bio that advertises him as an agent of the NSA, CIA and
Defense Intelligence Agency at one time or another, Robert Minehart
has put on-line a tutorial in information warfare at a U.S. Army
training school in Carlisle, PA.  Minehart's official title is
"Visiting Professor of Information Warfare."</P>

<P>Net browsers can take the tutorial -- apparently part of a larger
30-hour course -- and then answer questions to assess their
comprehension.</P>

<P>In one part of the tutorial, Minehart covers weaponry.</P>

<P>"Notice: Due to the sensitive nature of this section, the weapons
presented are ones proposed by open source (non-government) authors,"
he writes.</P>

<P>"The examples offered should only be considered as concepts to
stimulate your thoughts on 'what-if' possibilities.</P>

<P>"THIS PRESENTATION NEITHER CONFIRMS NOR DENIES THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH
WEAPONS!" states Minehart menacingly.</P>

<P>Then Minehart begins the discussion with viruses.  OK.  Crypt
Newsletter confirms it.  Computer virus existence confirmed!</P>

<P>In a section in which he mixes viruses and the Clipper encryption
chip, Minehart explains, "Viruses are computer programs that can infect
systems and cause damage. They are usually hidden within safe-looking
programs (usually shareware or freeware)."</P>

<P>No, professor, most viruses are spread in 1997 through exchanged
diskettes with infected system sectors and in infected documents
produced by Microsoft Word.</P>

<P>Further, Minehart writes, "A virus must first be identified and
its signature catalogued before a virus program can detect its
presence and eliminate it."</P>

<P>Minehart is referring to anti-virus scanners but he's made another
mistake of omission all the more mystifying because
Minehart lists in his bibliography a fellow, Padgett Peterson, whose
anti-virus programs don't require the definition of any virus
signature strings within the software.</P>

<P>Parts of the discussion on info-war weapons fly off
into the "Liquor in the front, poker in the rear of the flyin'
saucer" bad science familiar to Crypt Newsletter readers: the
electromagnetic pulse death rays; silicon-wafer eating bacteria.</P>

<P>Other portions of the tutorial veer into generic Tom
Clancy-derived policy statements. Computer viruses, for example, become
strategic weapons, perhaps to be handled like nuclear munitions.</P>

<P>"Strategic IW weapons however, will most likely be reserved for
release by the highest level. For example, a computer virus that would
cripple a nation's monetary system or may seize control of international
satellites must be controlled by either the President (SECDEF if
authority has been delegated).[sic]"</P>

<P>A recurrent theme is that Department of Defense must "lead from
behind" by being the instrument of government through which the
info-war threat is assessed.  DoD will work closely with corporate
America to determine its weaknesses and then -- Minehart doesn't
say this outright -- the American taxpayer gets the bill with the
U.S. weapons industry expanding to sell security products and info-war
software, like military hardware, worldwide.</P>

<P>"Tomorrow's enemy  will only be able to communicate, finance, or
logistically relocate that which our leadership allows," writes
Minehart, our info-warriors presumably victorious. "Our adversary will
be blinded by a complete cyberfog."</P>

<P>Don't take my word for it, look it up yourself at:

<P>KADENA AFB INFO-WARRIORS ABOUT EQUAL TO AOL-TYPE ON-LINE ROOKIES</P>

<P>Although there's plenty of quote from U.S. military leaders
wishing to show they talk the talk of info-warriors, there's little
empirical evidence the rank and file are beginning to walk the
walk.</P>

<P>For example, in the September 1996 issue of Airman magazine,
devoted mostly to fluffy features on information warfare, one
weirdly optimistic article revealed most soldiers connected to the
Net seem to have about the same savvy with regard to potential computer
hotfoots as AOL-style rookies. Unless, of course, it's all an elaborate
disinformation campaign.</P>

<P>In a simple test, computer specialists from Kelly Air Force
base in Texas sent bogus mail to unsuspecting targets at Kadena
AFB in Japan.  Like typical bogus mail, it masqueraded as
a simple request from system gurus to cough up user names and
passwords "in order to restore the integrity of system files."</P>

<P>One hundred forty-nine -- that's right -- one-four-nine --
promptly turned over their passwords and account information
to the raiders.</P>

<P>Airman magazine reported Kadena AFB information technology
personnel claiming they thwarted the attack, alleging only eight
of 149 passwords actually made it back to Kelly. Sure, guys.</P>

<P>Info-warriors also were alleged to have found 14 computer virus
infections on Kadena computers and 302 easily guessed passwords.</P>

<P>Kadena AFB representatives wishfully rated themselves as
nine on a ten scale in terms of knowing something of proper computer
security. Crypt Newsletter hopes never to see the trainwreck that passes
for outright failure.</P>

<P>Without question, MIT's Nicholas Negroponte is the Pope of

fired ovens, Sicilians, energy pills and "nanocleaning" knives.</P>

     LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:
     ======================

Dear Crypt:

I ran across your web page. Great stuff. I've been doing this
since the '70s. I think management is worse than Ph.D's in buying
this [hoax] crap (though the Clinton virus is hilarious as are the
others).

When I worked at Edwards, all the idiots became managers as any
engineer or programmer went to school to - __get this__ - be an
engineer or programmer, NOT to be a manager and push paper.

I'm old and cynical enough to look through the bullshit. Position
and a Ph.D. doesn't mean squat. look at the Defense Science Board and
their analyst staff. I went to school with these "staffers." No, you
don't have to know what you're doing to write [their] crap. Who knows,
next week they may be staffing on welfare reform or agricultural
subsidies.

Having worked towards a Ph.D. (Leaving was mutual disgust. They didn't
like my telling them their statistics were at the undergrad level,
and that the great programming example was nothing more than
"Life" revisited -- great code from the '70s.) I know the lobotomy
that you go through to get one.

Keep up the good work. Just never, never get a job where you have to
use government data, like I do. (No, the data doesn't match up -- the
variables are not defined, there is no data dictionary . . .
aaaaagggghhh!!!)

Frank@sdps

-----------------------
Dear Crypt:

As a former cryptolinguist in the Navy -- a job complete with
excruciatingly paranoid and fascist security policies -- I am
grateful for the Crypt Newsletter. Though a drop in the bucket when
compared with the sheer volume of dangerous disinformation spewed
out by the bureaucratic machine that is the Intelligence [sic]
Community, _Crypt_ is an essential source of REAL, unspun news.

Thank you, my WWW bookmark is in place.

Ed Flagg

-----------------------

Crypt:


I remember [Clinton Haines] from NuKENeT days.  It's harsh and unfeeling
and un-Christian and evil and bad and wrong and not-nice to say that
I think there should be a picture of Charles Darwin on his tombstone, so
I won't say it.  Dying in the bathroom in an opiate stupor with a
needle stuck in one's arm is a most unbecoming way to go, don't you
think?

Was it Gary Watson who once suggested (in apparent seriousness) that
virus authors should be executed?  Perhaps he thrills at the news.

If you ever hear that I killed myself in a particularly distasteful
manner, please do your best to show my infinite stupidity to your
readership (who will care for exactly 0.0012 seconds).  Or do it
beforehand, if you wish.

See ya,

Cory Tucker

-----------------------

Crypt:

I enjoy your newsletter, but if you really want to beam in on
Net silliness, you're missing a good bet. What you need is (1) a
grep-like, full-text search capability for the back issues on your
website, and (2) access to logs of the users' submissions for your
continuing amusement and general dismay.

Any distant hope that the superhighway is leading somewhere will be
rapidly dispelled. I run a site called "NameBase," which consists
of a cumulative name index to 500 investigative books on various
topics of concern to those interested in politics, the intelligence
community, current events, scandals, etc. It took the last 17 years
to put this data together.

I've been enduring searches for Michael Jackson, O.J. Simpson, and
other Hollywood hypes for two years now, but I nevertheless managed
to hang on to my sense of purpose.

Recently, however, I added a full-text search to lock on a word or
phrase in our newsletters and 500 book reviews. I wasn't prepared
for what the logs showed -- there's an extremely serious
dumbing-down problem in our culture, and I don't mean maybe. As your
newsletter has often noted, our mass media is leading us down the
primrose path toward terminal culture rot. We deserve to be crushed by
Chinese exports, even if they are produced by prison labor. Rather
like the barbarians picking away at the Romans.

One recent example was the user who searched for "collaboration of
universities with the intellectual community." I could be generous
and assume that this person meant "intelligence community," but a
year ago I stopped writing routines for the purpose of idiot-
proofing the website. No matter what I did, there was some new
level of weirdness staring at me from the next day's log.

In any case, the way this clueless user's search was formulated,
they got zero hits. Needless to say, there hasn't been any
collaboration of American universities with the intellectual
community for some time now. That's why I dropped out of grad
school 20 years ago!
