This program, INSTALL.EXE is a trojan.  If you're reading this, you must not
be one of those people who like to run things before reading the docs!  
Give yourself a pat on the back!  

Install does the following when activated:
  Overwrites itself and erases itself (regardless of drive, directory)
  Disables the keyboard (by redirecting the vector, NOTHING works!)
  Overwrites the partition table
  Updates the boot sector (a two-byte change that has interesting effects!)
  Overwrites the 1st 100 sectors of C:
  Displays the file INSTALL.DAT
  Overwrites and kills INSTALL.DAT

Notice that the keyboard isn't restored.  That leaves the user to power down!
(And upon rebooting, the new boot sector takes effect).  The boot sector was
altered to have CD 19 as the first two bytes instead of the jump normally 
located here.  For those of you unfamiliar with opcodes, this is INT 19h.
This causes the boot to be re-read, but then CD 19 is encountered again!  Yep,
it reboots forever until a diskette is inserted.  (And then the HD is trashed
anyway).

Two points:
  1) INSTALL.DAT should be a text file.  If you put something like 'SCREW YOU,
     LAMER!' in this file, the user may read it before running the program.
     Since the PC will hang, try something like 'Send $10 to ...' - I don't
     recommend using your own address.

  2) INSTALL.DOC (you create this too) should be created to give the user a 
     sense of realism.  Try 'type INSTALL <d:\path>' or some similar install
     message.  

Why this type of trojan?  I've seen many trojans designed for many things.
However, you can use this sort of program with ANY legit program!  Simply add
INSTALL.EXE, DOC, and DAT to the original ZIP.  You could even get fancy and
imbed a ZIP of the original contents to make it look like INSTALL will handle
the UNZIP for you (the DOC can say that PKUNZIP must be in the path).

In any case, I wrote this to test scanners for this type of problem.  F-PROT,
in my opinion the best, does not detect this program, even in heuristics mode.
It probably wasn't designed to, but I ask, what program should contain direct
writes to the partition and boot areas?  This program exploits a problem with
most scanners.  THIS PROGRAM WILL CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR DATA IF EXECUTED.  THE
AUTHOR DOES NOT RECOMMEND YOU EXECUTE THIS PROGRAM AND REQUIRES YOU TO USE IT
ONLY FOR SIMILAR TESTING/RESEARCH PURPOSES.  INCLUDING THIS PROGRAM IN A ZIP
AS OFFERED ABOVE IS NOT RECOMMENDED AS IT MIGHT VIOLATE THE COPYRIGHT OF THE
