<P>CRYPT NEWSLETTER NEEDS YOUR HELP:</P>

<P>Crypt News has never asked its readers for a favor but it has
to ask for one now.  What was shiny and new twenty issues ago in 1995
is now starting to squeak and groan with age.  Crypt Newsletter
needs a hardware upgrade!</P>

<P>If you enjoy Crypt News regularly, you can help keep the news
coverage hot by purchasing a copy of my book "The Virus Creation Labs."
It's available through COMSEC, Ltd. (www.comsecltd.com) as well 
as bookstores. Eventually, a small but reasonable royalty gets to Crypt 
News and helps the publication. Or, you might consider passing on a 
piece of used equipment -- that actually works <g>.  A hard disk, a 
monitor . . . Or just donate!</P>

<P>Now, back to our regularly scheduled transmission.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<P>SOME GHOST STORIES SEEN THROUGH A MIRROR: The Hudson Institute's
info-war hallucination.</P>

<P>If you visit this page often you surely have noticed grim dramas
that play themselves out in the pronouncements of various national
security experts.</P>

<P>Time and time again, prophets appear to warn that our safety and
security are at stake or that fantastical threats and intrigue
are mounting in the corridors of foreign power.</P>

<P>The solutions offered are always the same. Spend more taxpayer
dollars.  Give them to the Pentagon, proxies of the Pentagon,
and/or consultants offering guidance to the Department of Defense.</P>

<P>In the mainstream media, no one ever questions the methods or
results of the prophets of national doom even though the same
prophets have racked up a startling number of foolish mistakes and
false alarms in the past few years.</P>

<P>Few average Americans know how such mistakes are vended as
truth or how intelligence information is twisted into unrecognizable
analyses that share no relationship with their original sources.  No
one gets to look behind the doors of the national security
apparatus except the carefully screened.  Never you and certainly
never anyone you know.</P>

<P>Well, this story gives you a peek behind that door.  It's a
look at the nuts-and-bolts constituting an intelligence analysis provided
by a highly respected think tank.  Buckle yourself in and grab the bottle
of Tums because it's not a pretty picture.</P>

<P>In Crypt News 44, you read the tale of Mary C. FitzGerald, a
Hudson Institute research fellow whose paper "Russian Views on
Electronic and Information Warfare" dove into the realms of
telepathy, the paranormal and their alleged military application.</P>

<P>In it, FitzGerald fell for an old April Fool's joke known as
the Gulf War virus hoax, too.</P>

<P>The Hudson Institute paper stated:</P>

<P>"For example, one cannot exclude the use of software inserts in
imported gear used in the Iraqi air defense system for
blocking it at the beginning of the war," is one of the incarnations
of it -- as reprinted from "Russian Views on Electronic and Information
Warfare." Published on the Internet earlier this year, it was
disseminated through Winn Schwartau's Information Warfare mailing
list.</P>

<P>But where did this come from?</P>

<P>Ironically, the same statement can be found in an article retrieved
from the CIA's Foreign Information Broadcast Surface (FBIS).  Crypt
Newsletter obtained an interesting FBIS English translation of an article
published in October of 1995. Written by a Major M. Boytsov, it
appeared with the title "Russia: Information Warfare" in a Russian
publication entitled "In Foreign Navies."</P>

<P>Despite it's misleading title, Boytsov's article is not about Russian
ideas on information warfare.  Instead, it is more a survey and analysis
of <I>U.S. Department of Defense</I> thinking and effort on the subject.
Boytsov's sources are attributed in a footnote to the "foreign press."</P>

<P>So, in October of 1995, Boytsov writes in "Information Warfare,"
"For example, one cannot exclude the use of software inserts
[programmnyye zakladki] in imported gear used in the Iraqi air
defense system for blocking it at the beginning of the war." Since
Boytsov's sources are the "foreign press," it's quite likely
he read of the Gulf War virus hoax either from US News & World Report,
the original mainstream media source to spread it, or others
pulled along for the ride. (As we've learned, this particular hoax
sprang from an April Fool's joke published in Infoworld magazine.
The joke was accepted as reality by the national news media and
now it's an inescapable part of computer virus lore.)</P>

<P>Since Mary C. FitzGerald's paper was provided as intelligence for
the U.S. military, it is of further interest to taxpayers to know that
money is being spent to educate the Department of Defense on issues
that are normally reserved for television programs on the
FOX network -- urban X-File-type myths.</P>

<P>Another section of the Hudson Institute research paper on Russian
views in information warfare are worth reviewing when compared with a
completely different article published in <I>1994</I> by a colonel in
the Russian military.</P>

<P>Appearing in an August 1994 issue of Foreign Military Review,
and again made available to Crypt Newsletter translated from Russian
through the CIA's Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS),
Colonel V. Pavlychev writes in the article "Psychotronic Weapons: Myth or
Reality":</P>

<P>"The second direction [at the U.S. Department of Defense] includes
an in-depth study of paranormal phenomena that are of greatest interest
from the standpoint of possible military use -- clairvoyance, telekinesis,
and so forth."</P>

<P>Most of Pavlychev's paper is written from the standpoint
of discussing U.S. Department of Defense <I>involvement</I> in potential
use of the paranormal as a weapon.  Leaving aside the ridiculous nature of
the topic for an instant, keep in mind that Mary C. FitzGerald's Hudson
Institute paper is on "Russian" military <I>views</I>.</P>

<P>In "Russian Views on Electronic and Information Warfare," published
by the Hudson Institute and FitzGerald on the Internet earlier this year,
we see:</P>

<P>"The second direction includes an in-depth study of paranormal
phenomena that are of greatest interest from the standpoint of
possible military use -- clairvoyance, telekinesis, telepathic hypnosis,
and so forth."</P>

<P>But wait.  These aren't <I>Russian</I> views at all.  Instead,
Colonel Pavlychev attributes them to two Americans: Russell Targ and
Keith Harary, who authored a book called "The Psychic Race" in 1984.
Targ was a known as a psychic researcher at Stanford Research Institute
in the Seventies and Eighties until this type of fringe science became
badly discredited.  Harary was a psychic who worked with Targ and
who occasionally published in unusual journals like "Journal of the
American Society of Psychical Research."</P>

<P>Pavlychev also writes on the <I>U.S.</I> use of remote-viewers, or
clairvoyants -- which is what most people, including the Russians, call
them. ("Remote viewer," in Crypt Newsletter's estimation, was nothing
but a clever dodge used by the crackpots in the U.S. Army and intelligence
agencies in the Eighties to avoid immediately tipping off supervisors,
the press and the skeptical that they were involved in using the
equivalent of "crystal ball gazers" for military reconnaissance.)</P>

<P>Anyway, Pavlychev's article states:</P>

<P>"The framework of this phenomenon is quite broad: on a
strategic scale, it is possible to penetrate the enemy's main
command and control facilities to become familiar with his
classified documents; on the tactical level, reconnaissance can
be conducted on the battlefield and in the enemy's rear area
(the "clairvoyant-scout" will always be located at a safe
place). However, problems do exist -- the number of individuals
possessing these abilities is limited, and the data received
cannot be checked."</P>

<P>Once again, this is material roughly attributed to Targ and
Harary in 1984 -- not Russians in 1997.</P>

<P>In the Hudson Institute research paper, this year,
we read:</P>

<P>"The framework of this phenomenon is quite broad:  on a strategic
scale, it is possible to penetrate the enemy's main command-and-control
facilities to become familiar with his classified documents; on the
tactical level, reconnaissance can be conducted on the battlefield and
in the enemy's rear area (the 'clairvoyant-scout' will always be located
at a safe place).  However, problems do exist -- the number of
individuals possessing these abilities is limited, and the data
received cannot be checked."</P>

<P>In Pavlychev's "Psychotronic Weapons," we see:</P>

<P>"According to military experts, using psychokinesis to
destroy command and control systems and disrupt the functioning of
strategic arms is timely. The ability of a human organism to
emit a certain type of energy today has been confirmed by
photography of a radiation field known as the Kirlian effect.
Psychokinesis is explained by the subject's generation of an
electromagnetic force capable of moving or destroying some
object. Studies of objects destroyed as a result of experiments
conducted have shown a different form of breakage than under the
effect of physical force."</P>


<P>The Hudson Institute researcher writes in 1997:</P>

of an electromagnetic force capable of moving or destroying some object.
Studies of objects destroyed as a result of experiments
conducted have shown a different form of breakage than under the
effect of physical force."</P>

<P>In 1994, Pavlychev says:</P>

<P>Using telepathic implantation, an enemy formation, "instead
of exploiting the success, will try to consolidate on the line
achieved or even return to the starting line."</P>

<P>In 1997, the Hudson Institute research paper states of the power
of implanted telepathic command: "For example, personnel of an enemy
formation executing a sudden breakthrough of defenses, instead of
exploiting the success, will try to consolidate on the line achieved
or even return to the starting line."</P>

<P>In 1994, Pavlychev states:</P>

<P>"Many western experts, including military analysts, assume that
the country making the first decisive breakthrough in this field will
gain a superiority over its enemy that is comparable only with the
monopoly of nuclear weapons. In the future, these type of
weapons may become the cause of illnesses or death of an object
(person), and without any risk to the life of the operator
(person emitting the command). Psychotronic weapons are silent,
difficult to detect, and require the efforts of one or several
operators as a source of power. Therefore, scientific and
military circles abroad are very concerned over a possible
'psychic invasion' and note the need to begin work on taking
corresponding countermeasures."</P>

<P>In 1997, the Hudson Institute publication reads:</P>

require the efforts of one or several operators as a source of power.
Therefore, scientific and military circles abroad are very concerned
over a possible 'psychic invasion' . . . "</P>

<P>Pavlychev's 1994 article also distinctly points to sources
derived from <I>U.S.</I> writers, specifically, the eccentrics --
colleagues of Hal Puthoff, and employees of military men Albert
Stubblebine and John B. Alexander's "spoon-bending" and "out of body
experience" programs -- in residence at Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) and the U.S. Army to study the paranormal in the
Eighties.</P>

<P>Other material from the Pavlychev paper is roughly attributed
to another U.S. source, a book called "Mind Wars: The True Story of
Government Research Into the Potential of Psychic Weapons,"
written by Ronald McRae and published by St. Martins in 1984.</P>

<P>And still other sources include American network television shows
and the New York Times -- obviously also published in the <I>U.S.</I>.</P>

<P>It need repeating that Pavlychev's article is <I>not</I> a monograph
on Russian military views on the paranormal, but rather his analysis of
the U.S. military's involvement in the area with information obtained
from open source literature published in the United States.</P>

<P>Paradoxically, the Hudson Institute's Mary C. FitzGerald uses
the same subject material as Pavlychev's 1994 article and turns
it around 180 degrees to show "Russian Views on Electronic and
Information Warfare."</P>

<P>What does all this gobble on telepathy and psychotronic
brain weapons from books on the paranormal and comments from
fringe researchers written in the Eighties have to do with
Russian views on information warfare today? Does it have anything to
do with information warfare and Internet security at all?
Excellent questions!  Ask the mandarins at the Hudson Institute.
Perhaps they know.</P>

<P>All of this serves to demonstrate that the environment in which these
weird stories of strange pseudo-science and technology in service
to the military machine circulate is like a hall of mirrors in which the
equivalent of techno-myths and modern ghost stories bounce back and
forth through Cold War minds until few can even tell where they
originally came from.</P>

<P>Like any good ghost story, they gain credibility when passed through
supposedly expert sources -- think tanks. But the only thing remarkable
about them is how they're used to frighten the ignorant -- in this case,
military men, political leaders or uncritical journalists.</P>

<P>-----------------</P>

<P>Notes: Mary C. FitzGerald responded to having her report
written up with regards to the Gulf War virus hoax in the Netly News.
Her comments are appended to the original (URL below) and they are
republished here in contrast with this issue's analysis.</P>

<P>Mary C. FitzGerald replied:</P>

<P>"According to George Smith, the sun revolves around the earth, the
earth is flat, the Conquest of the Skies will never fly, and the new
Revolution in Military Affairs is a Pentagon war-theory euphemism
wherein futuristic contraptions are predominantly products of wishful
thinking.</P>

<P>"Mr. Smith debunks the potential use of computer viruses in warfare. He
further argues that they are merely a conspiracy by the Pentagon and
conservative think tanks designed to enhance a non-existent threat --
presumably to increase defense spending. He has the right to say
whatever he thinks, but the only thing he has demonstrated is his own
selective paranoia.</P>

<P>"The paper he cites is my presentation of Russian views on the nature
of future war, a subject to which the Russians for many decades have
devoted extensive resources and manpower. The Chief of the Russian
General Staff, Marshal Ogarkov, not the Pentagon, used the phrase the
Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) over two decades ago to point out
the impact of technology on future warfare. His writings and those of
other Russian military theorists on the RMA are proving to be very
prophetic. Ogarkov in the mid-70s correctly envisioned the type of
warfare that was demonstrated in Desert Storm. Russian military
theorists are evaluating not only the impact of computer viruses, but
also all other types of information weapons, logic bombs, special
microbes, and micro-chipping. They are also studying the impact of
other new technologies (such as precision-guided munitions,
third-generation nuclear weapons, and weapons based on new physical
principles). George Smith may refuse to accept the potential of new
technologies on modern warfare, but the Russians clearly disagree with
him.</P>

<P>"P.S. Throughout his commentary, Mr. Smith erroneously takes my
discussion of what Russian military theorists have said and presents
it as direct quotes from me."</P>

<I>Another brief in a continuing series.</I></P>

<P><I>Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)</I>:
gigantic contractor for the Pentagon which most Americans have never
heard of; or, a secret corporation that relies almost exclusively
upon taxpayer dollars for profits.</P>

<P>Usage: "The ideal <I>Science Applications International Corporation</I>

<P>---from the <I>Joseph K Guide to Tech Terminology</I></P>
<HR>
<P>
<P>While examining the Hudson Institute's 1997 research paper on
information warfare, Crypt News did a cross-reference of the term
"remote viewing" in the Washington Post's database, reasoning that
older material on Pentagon and intelligence agency involvement
would crop up.</P>

<P>Indeed, such was the case.  And Crypt News' favorite secretive
DoD contractor bore mention, too.  That's right! Science Applications
International Corporation's (SAIC), Tyson's Corner, Virginia, office
was administering these pseudo-science programs on taxpayer dollars
as late as 1995.</P>

<P>"We aren't going to be able to discuss any details about this
without permission from the client," was the only comment The Washington
Post reporter was able to wrest from a SAIC mouthpiece.
The <I>client</I>, in the Post article, was indeterminate: either
the Defense Intelligence Agency or the Pentagon.</P>

<P>The non-disclosure comment is common to Science Applications
representatives.  Alert Crypt Newsletter readers may recall the company
employing a similar dodge when called before Congress in 1996 to discuss
alleged computer break-ins at Department of Defense and corporate
networks.</P>

<P>Administering the SAIC program was a "nuclear physicist," Edwin
C. May.  May was a firm believer in the paranormal program and employed
two psychics who had formerly peddled their trade at SRI in
California.</P>

<P>The psychics were said to have tried to view <I>underground
tunnels</I> in North Korea.  A couple of years earlier, they attempted
to find SCUD missiles during the Gulf War.</P>

<P>RUSSIA: THE VIRTUAL FALLGUY</P>

<P>Crypt Newsletter readers may have noticed how some computer
security "experts" and bemused technology reporters in the mainstream
media tend to spread tales of menacing goings on in the
former Soviet Union.  They always make for good fireside
reading.</P>

<P>Cliff Stoll had a skeptic's tool he used "Silicon Snake Oil" to defend
against frank bull.  He called it his "bogometer."  Crypt News
calls its model of the "bogometer" the phlogiston spectrometer. If you
see news stories invoking the "Russians" as perpetrators of some futuristic
sounding techo-atrocity, your phlogiston spectrometer should be
clicking.</P>

<P>Crypt Newsletter summarizes a few of the best of these tales
for your review:</P>

<P>1. "Embittered Russian computer programmers, out of work since
the collapse of the Soviet Union, are busy writing computer viruses
as revenge against their former masters and the West. Soon
Western computers will collapse under the virtual plague."</P>

<P>This one cropped up in the earlier part of the decade, was seen
frequently until about 1994 and now only rarely shows up in pieces
written by the totally out-of-it. It formed a partial basis for an
entertaining book called "Approaching Zero" (Bantam), now out of print
in this country.</P>

<P>Have you noticed your neighborhood computers crashing
under the weight of Russian-made computer viruses, lately?</P>

<P>2. "The Russians are the inventors of information warfare."</P>

<P>See Mary C. FitzGerald's remarks in this issue.  Sometimes
it's seen in another permutation: "The Chinese are the leaders in
information warfare."</P>

<P>3. "Terrorists in Russia are selling plans, peddling
working models, and disseminating technology on the Internet of/for
electromagnetic pulse ray guns, hand grenades, mortars, etc."</P>

<P>See back issues of the Crypt Newsletter. Spread by the U.S.
military, wire services, popular science magazines and consultants to
the Department of Defense.</P>

<P>4. "The Russians are developing mental telepathy as a weapon.
Trained psychokinetic assassins have killed tethered goats at 60
paces in secret trials."</P>

<P>SCARY SYMANTEC LAWSUIT SECRETS</P>

<P>What do "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and Symantec have in
common? No, they're not tasteless entertainments -- but that's a
good guess.</P>

<P>Both purchased the services of TV horror hostess Elvira (a.k.a
Cassandra Peterson) this Halloween season.</P>

<P>Two days prior to Halloween, Symantec commissioned the
"Mistress of the Dark" and self-proclaimed "guy's favorite sport
utility vehicle" to appear as "Elvirus" at Gardena High School in
Southern California.  "Elvirus" was Symantec's choice as "computer
virus expert" and she held a seminar on those scary, scary replicating
programs for the students.  The computer lab was reportedly done up
to resemble a <I>mad scientist's</I> while Peterson declaimed on the
horrors of infected files and technological catastrophe. On Halloween,
Elvira acted as host for a TV broadcast for Tobe Hooper's film
of a cannibalistic family of cretins, allegedly patterned on the
life of serial murderer Ed Gein.  From computer viruses to flesh-eaters.
Now that's mental flexibility.</P>

<P>Booooooo! Pretty frightening.</P>

<P>But not as frightening as the nightmares Symantec flacks must
have about Trio Systems' lawsuit against the company becoming
common knowledge.</P>

<P>In case you've been out of the country, Symantec has been waging
an information war against arch-rival McAfee Associates.  The
company has launched a meretricious lawsuit accusing McAfee of
usurping Symantec computer code but seemingly more directly aimed
at damaging McAfee stock prices.</P>

<P>Trio Systems, a small firm in Pasadena, Calif., is suing Symantec
for copyright infringement on a massive scale, something you won't
find proudly mentioned in the raft of Symantec corporate
phlogiston issued on the McAfee case.</P>

<P>You see, Trio licenses a code library called C Index/II, which it
negotiated with Symantec for use in Norton Administrator and Norton
Desktop Administrator. However, Alan Bartholomew -- Trio's founder --
stumbled over his copyright notice in another Symantec product for
which no license had been negotiated.</P>

<P>Henry Gradstein, Trio's lawyer against Symantec in this case,
told Crypt Newsletter that Symantec "admitted in sworn interrogatory
statements" to the presence of "10 to 20,000 lines" of Trio's C Index/II
code in six other of its products, including Norton For Your Eyes Only,
Norton Utilities 8.0 for Windows and DOS, Norton Utilities for Win95 and PC
Anywhere versions for DOS, Win95 and Windows NT.</P>

<P>Asked what would be sought as reward in the case, Gradstein said,
"Nine figures."</P>

<P>"Ouch, ouch, oowwwwitccch," scream Symantec fluglemen as
they envision having to spin this one into a corporate victory, should
it all turn out badly.</P>

<P>IMAN DE EXCREMENTO: NASA NETTLED BY NUISANCE MACRO VIRUS</P>

<P>In late October, Federal Computer Week featured a story about
macro virus infection at NASA.</P>

<P>The macro virus infecting NASA's Houston systems was subsequently
sent to Moscow's Mir space station controllers in a Word document
e-mail attachment where it also caused infections.</P>

<P>NASA officials blamed the Russians for being cash poor and not having
up-to-date software to catch the virus.  The Russians blamed
NASA for sending them the virus. There was surely a bucket load of blame
but no one who would bravely take a fall for it.</P>

<P>However, the story was refreshing news of techno-reality in stark
contrast to the usual company line in the mainstream media condemning the
Russians for the atrocity of Mir and crediting NASA as the repository of
all technological and scientific know-how in the Western world.</P>

<P>In fact, the macro virus infection at NASA revealed a certain
lack of techno-agility on the part of the U.S. organization since --
theoretically -- it's quite possible to obtain software from
the Internet which will unilaterally remove macros from Word
documents regardless of the identity of a putative virus. And
NASA, of course, is supposed to be well-wired.</P>

<P>Further, one might assume that computer programmers at NASA
have more than enough savvy to homebrew a specific remedy once
they had the virus in hand.</P>

<P>The Federal Computer Week piece also featured two <I>experts</I>
(see the Joseph K definition of the word in this issue for the
appropriate context) declaiming on the nature of the computer virus
problem: James Oberg and Henry Hertzfeld.</P>

<P>In addition, this particular piece had all the hallmarks of a
vendor leak. The phenomenon works like this: An anti-virus company
is called at the last minute by desperate administrators to supply a fix.
The vendor's marketing and p.r. departments get wind of it and
issue a quick press release to trade publications in order to
generate some publicity for the product. Hypocritically, the official
policy of the vendor is usually to refuse to document the names of
clients, citing ethical considerations and confidentiality, when
asked to provide examples of work supporting exorbitant claims of
virus infection in unrelated news stories.</P>

<P>MARSH COMMISSION DELIVERS CLASSIFIED REPORT, WORKS MEDIA LIKE PROS</P>

<P>In mid-October, the President's Commission on Critical
Infrastructure Protection delivered a report on threats from cyberspace
to the President. It was promptly classified. A second edition
for public consumption was made available on the Commission's
Website in Adobe Acrobat format the first week in November.</P>

<P>However, commissioners used the week of the report's delivery to
work the media with sensational leaks about cyberdoom.</P>

<P>It was a good strategy because it gave reporters plenty of hooks
to write about without giving them the means to determine if they
were being fed a load of phlogiston.</P>

<P>USA Today's Mike Zuckerman covered the event closely and published
a number of the Marsh commission's claims.  One that immediately
stuck out was a baldly exaggerated claim about the nature of computer 
virus infections.</P>

<P>"Five hundred new computer viruses evolve every month . . . and
three thousand are active at any one time," claimed a commissioner.</P>

<P>As most who've read the Crypt Newsletter for an extended period
of time know, these numbers are complete fabulation.</P>

<P>Crypt News queried Mike Zuckerman and the USA Today reporter
replied that he was skeptical of the numbers, too, but that the
commission had fended him off without providing sources.</P>

<P>Zuckerman added, in retrospect, that he wished he had pressed
the commission harder.</P>

<P>In any case, the day after the report's release, the commission's
figurehead, Robert T. Marsh, appeared on CNBC briefly in the afternoon.
While he would not respond to specific questions posed by the
interviewer, he did take the time to essentially declare U.S. "teenagers"
a menace to the nation's security because of the availability of
hacker tools on the Internet, and in his estimation, the certain
will to employ them. This startlingly paranoid claim was quickly
buried by the brevity of the interview and the news that the
Department of Justice was taking on Microsoft, an event which
eclipsed most of what the commission had to say to the mainstream
media the same week.</P>

<P>Prior to the release of the report, Marsh had been busy delivering
speeches at computer security conventions -- actually one speech,
repeated over and over, later amended to address the recommendations
the commission was preparing.  Through the first part of the summer,
Marsh gave an identical speech to numerous audiences.  By fall,
the speech had been changed slightly in content.  For those who
are wondering about the nature of it, Marsh's speech follows the format:
First he tells you about the reason for his commission, then he tells
you about the commission -- and then he tells you how extensively
the commission worked with our national community to assess the
cyberthreat. In the fall, the speech was changed to include the
commissions' recommendations, which were provided on a press release
to the media at the time Marsh handed over the report to the President.
(<I>Don't take Crypt Newsletter's word for it.  The President's Commission
archives all of Marshes speeches on its Website
-- http://www.pccip.gov.</I>)</P>

<P>While on the surface this appeared to be a legitimate effort at
community outreach, it should be noted that a great many of Marsh's
speaking engagements were at computer security industry conventions
were the price of admission averaged into the hundreds of dollars.
A case in point is Oceana Publications' "Financial Crimes and
Information Warfare" conferences in Washington, D.C. and New York.
The asking door price is about $1,200 to get a crack at hearing
Robert T. Marsh.</P>

<P>The overly cynical may note that Robert T. Marsh -- figuring as
prominently as he does in the advertising brochures for various
conference -- has become a celebrity draw and cash cow for the
vendors.</P>

<P>CALLING VICTOR VON DOOM</P>

<P>If you scratch some information warriors deeply enough, you often
find a fanatic adherent to the weird stories surrounding inventor
Nikola Tesla.</P>

<P>Such was the case with an entertaining paper presented by
electromagnetic pulse gun enthusiast, Victor von Doom of
Queensland University in Brisbane, Australia. (<I>Not his real name,
but Crypt Newsletter has used it in the past as a handy alias for those
who spread unusual tales of these chupacabras of cyberspace.</I>)</P>

<P>Delivering a paper at a recent National Computer Security Association
conference on information warfare, von Doom invoked Tesla's
alleged "death rays" as viable electromagnetic pulse weapons.</P>

<P>"Nikola Tesla, aged 78, in 1934 released details of a death-beam,
an invention powerful enough to destroy 10,000 planes 250 miles away; to
kill without a trace," von Doom breathlessly writes in "The Emerging
Technologies Driving Information Warfare Globally."</P>

<P>Cattle prods are also tools of the well-equipped info warrior.
"CATTLE PRODS . . . are high-voltage devices used to prod, help
along, slow cattle.  These devices generate a high-voltage across two
metal probes which are held on the back of the cow.  When you push
the prod onto the animal's back it activates a switch allowing
a high-voltage discharge to be transmitted to the animal giving
it a jolt," continues von Doom.</P>

<P>Also, for those building ion-drive space-craft in their basement:
"If we consider what has been developed in other disciplines
of science we find that there is open-source literature
that describes how to build ion-engines and thrusters to be
used as engines for space probes . . . By now you should be aware
that some of the different aspects associated with these
devices are damaging to computers/information systems . . ."</P>

<P>"CAUTION! - THE INFORMATION IS OUT THERE!" von Doom balefully
warns his readers.</P>

<P>It's true.  Information on Tesla "death rays" and related
topics is <I>out there.</I> Despite formidable contributions to
science, Telsa was also prone to making wild and fabulous claims
to journalists.  Today, he is accidentally known as something of
a patron saint for all crackpot scientists.  Indeed, if one
conducts makes a few searches on the Internet it is simple to produce
a wealth of crazy stories about Tesla attributing to him
everything from the Tunguska blast (it was a result of his
<I>death ray</I> experiments) to patents that have
enabled the U.S. government to construct secret orbital space
fortresses equipped with gamma ray lasers.</P>

<P>THUNDERBYTE ANTIVIRUS FOR WIN95</P>

<P>by Stephen Poole</P>

<P>The oddest praise that one can give Franz Veldman's Thunderbyte anti-virus
software is that the virus writers regard it highly. Many, many
reams of electronic text have been wasted trying to generate a variety
of dodges for it.  The great majority remain curiosities. And a handful of
computer viruses have been written specifically to attack a portion of
the program no longer supported by Veldman. Only one, to my knowledge,
ever spread widely.  (If you want the full details, read <I>"The Virus
Creation Labs."</I>)</P>

<P>TBAV pioneered "heuristic detection," or the ability to examine a
file for suspicious-looking code.  TBAV was also one of the first systems
to read the hard drive directly to avoid being fooled by a resident
virus.</P>

<P>But TBAV's hallmark is, and always has been, near-perfect detection rates
coupled with blazing speed.  I tested version 8.02 for Windows 95, and it
impeccably sorted out over 2,000 files in less than a minute, detecting
every virus on my system with ease.  Macro viruses, classic file infectors,
boot infectors on diskettes, it didn't matter; TBAV nailed 'em.</P>

<P>Having said that, I'll leave TBAV's detection performance with a resounding
"well-done." I'd rather take a look at how it acts on a typical Windows 95
system, because that's where its strengths and weaknesses become
apparent.</P>

<P>The installation program is simple enough; you select "Setup", and the
program does the rest.  There's also an Uninstaller, should you choose to
remove the program later.</P>

<P>TBAV uses the "scan target" approach -- i.e., it scans preconfigured
lists of drives and subdirectories.  The installer creates a few default
targets, including "Scan All Hard Drives." To do more specific scans, you
can create other targets by simply clicking a few buttons.</P>

<P>To scan, you select a target and click the "Scan" button.  I did, and
encountered my first surprise: TBAV version 8.02 was unable to scan a FAT32
boot sector.  It scanned the MBR of the hard drive just fine; but returned
"Access denied" on the operating system sector.</P>

<P>To be fair, the Windows 95 OSR2 release with FAT32 caught many AV and
utilities vendors by surprise, and I expect that Thunderbyte will address
this in a later release.  It's still a bit surprising, given Thunderbyte's
reputation, and the fact that the problem has been known for some
time.</P>

<P>TBAV also includes the "TBSetup" program, which can be
used to create Anti-Vir.Dat files containing validation information for the
files in each subdirectory. If a virus changes a program and it's listed
in these files, TBAV will throw up a warning on any subsequent scan.</P>

<P>Now we get to the heuristics.  I first tried this feature under DOS many
years ago, and found it to be just too blame paranoid.  It warned of even
the most innocuous oddities in a file.</P>

<P>The heuristics are retained in Version 8.02 for Windows 95.  I was amused
to learn that TBAV will warn of the presence of a Windows file header.  If
you do a scan and create a log file to catch all warnings, the result will
essentially be a directory listing of all Windows files on the system!</P>

<P>To get around this, if you're going to use the heuristics, TBAV has
a Setup module to create the validation files first.  You create them, then
scan. If you get false alarms on known good files, you select "validate"
to add them to the Anti-Vir.dat file.  This suppresses future warning,
or false-alarms in this case.</P>

<P>Still, the average user will probably be terrified by heuristics.
They'll see the "infected by an unknown virus" warning and be needlessly
concerned.  Joe Average User should probably just switch the heuristics
to LOW sensitivity, as I did.  Frans Veldman made his name on this
feature and it's very powerful in the hands of someone who knows
enough about anti-virus software and computer viruses to use it
effectively.  Veldman must certainly feel his philosophy on detecting
unknown viruses has been vindicated since most other
vendors have imitated this feature in one way or another in 1997.</P>

<P>With the concerns about receiving infected files, most anti-virus
packages have some form of resident protection.  This package
includes a VxD that permits TBAV to run in the background, checking every
file opened on the system automatically.</P>

<P>One of my tests was to copy a few infected files to another drive.
Sure enough, TBAV instantly hollered. A message box popped up with a
warning on virus-infected code.</P>

<P>But then I copied a file from one folder to another on the same drive
and nothing happened.  I was confused until I read the included "FAQ"
file in the package.  In general, TBAV uses an intelligent method to
determine when and what to scan.</P>

<P>For example, TBAV won't scan inside ZIP files, nor will it
immediately scan a downloaded file.  But it will scan as soon as the
file is unzipped, executed, or used in any other way, so the protection
is there.  By doing it this way, Thunderbyte improves performance
noticeably. Some competitors give users the option to examine anything
that moves through the system. It's an effective approach, too, but
it comes with a performance penalty.</P>

<P>The resident monitor has some other nice features one of which is
the ability to configure the software to check drive A: for a diskette
at shutdown. If the user pays attention, it goes a long way toward
preventing an infection of the hard disk created by someone carelessly
leaving an infected diskette in the drive and starting the machine
without removing it.</P>

<P>You can also configure TBAV to automatically do a "Background Scan" at
specified intervals.  I tried it with a setting of 30 minutes, and sure
enough, every half-hour, it would start scanning.  More impressive was the
fact that it hardly impaired performance.  On my 586/133, it was barely
noticeable.</P>

<P>There are a few  minor irritations.  For example, while the user
interface works fine, it gives the appearance of having been thrown
together at the last minute.  It flickers and redraws itself a few
times when you reactivate it from a minimized icon.</P>

<P>If you want proof that DOS is dying, TBAV doesn't even include a DOS
scanner in the package.  I can understand that the average user
wouldn't  use it anyway, but for some reason, its omission disturbs me.
[<I>TBAV still maintains a DOS version of the program. -- Editor.</I>]</P>

<P>Finally, I'm a programmer and I do crazy things to my system for a
living. I experienced some conflicts while I was working.  The worst was an
occasional General Protection Fault while compiling. I had to disable the
resident part of the program to continue but to be fair, I doubt the
average user would have a problem like this.</P>

<P>In sum, TBAV for Windows 95 is nicely done.  Thunderbyte needs to
add support for OSR2 FAT32 boot records but its most outstanding
features are accuracy, reliability, and speed.
At $99.00 for the Professional single-user version, it's a good deal.</P>
