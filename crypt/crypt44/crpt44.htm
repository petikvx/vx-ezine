<P>CRYPT NEWSLETTER NEEDS YOUR HELP:</P>

<P>Crypt News has never asked its readers for a favor but it has
to ask for one now.  What was shiny and new twenty issues ago in 1995
is now starting to squeak and groan with age.  Crypt Newsletter
needs a hardware upgrade!</P>

<P>If you enjoy Crypt News regularly, you can help keep the news
coverage hot by purchasing a copy of my book "The Virus Creation Labs."
It's available through Amazon and all good bookstores.
Eventually, a small but reasonable royalty gets to Crypt News and helps the
publication. Or, you might consider passing on a piece of used
equipment -- that actually works <g>.  A hard disk, a monitor . . . Or
just donate!</P>

<P>Now, back to our regularly scheduled transmission.</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>PERVERSIONS OF SCIENCE</P>

<P>Recently, US News & World Report featured a cover story on
the weird world of non-lethal weaponry.  Regular Crypt Newsletter
readers know this translates to electromagnetic pulse, infrasound,
ultrasound, and other assorted perversions of science which
military planners and futurists dream of weaponizing.</P>

<P>In a fascinating development, the US News & World Report article
cited a Huntington Beach, California, company called Scientific
Applications and Research Associates (SARA).</P>

<P>The company is said to lurk in an industrial park -- developing
weapons to turn your bowels to mush. Company CEO Parviz Parhami
implied his company's inventions might work in anywhere from two
to ten years.  They're ". . . just one more tool," he screeched
for US News. "Like any tool, I suppose this can be abused." Parhami
suggested they be used for humane purposes but the story did not
vigorously indicate what these might be.</P>

<P>Interestingly, SARA has a Website (www.sara.com).  Cryptic and brief,
the company uses a clutch of clever euphemisms for its development
work in what it dubs "Future Technologies."</P>

<P>"SARA is engaged in advanced technology development for future
applications . . . new objectives are emerging that include limited
effects technology (LET), low collateral damage, incremental denial
and area/perimeter monitoring and defense," reads the site.  This
refers to the development of infrasound guns and resonators for use
against people, and the site continues, "Included is our development
of compact, high power infrasound generators for the US Army as a
<I>potential</I> (Crypt News emphasis added) non-lethal 
weapon . . . "</P>

<P>Further, the company brochure states its interest in the development
of "compact high energy laser technologies," another area with a
non-lethal spin-off: the controversial blinding laser.  And, no
discussion would be complete without the mention of electric rays:
"Other SARA future technology areas include electromagnetic pulse
weapons, directed/triggered electric discharges and intense low
frequency electromagnetic fields."</P>

<P>All of these things are listed under "future technologies" and
"development."  There is no insistence they even exist.  However, one
product that SARA does say it sells, and Crypt News is not making this
up, is Restaurant Master, software designed to help you run your
restaurant business.</P>

<P>If you are a computer programmer or hardware engineer in need
of work, SARA is interested in hearing from you.  Of course,
you will have to be an American citizen. And it would be helpful
if you already had multiple security clearances for working on
Department of Defense black projects.  In addition, you will have
to have the mental agility -- or lack of it -- to be able to work
for supervisors who can rationalize the development of restaurant
managing software and potential weapons for inducing prostrating or
possibly lethal diarrhea in civilians, all under one roof.</P>

<P>And if this is not sufficiently "mad scientist" to suit your
fancy, consider that U.S. News and World Report interviewed
the Pentagon's Charles Swett -- who is not a scientist -- but who
nevertheless was attributed by the publication to maintain that the
military plans "to conduct human testing with lasers and acoustics
in the future . . . and that the testing will be constrained and
highly ethical."</P>

<P>If true, Crypt News poses these questions:</P>

<P>If the projects are classified in the Pentagon's black budget
how can it be assured that human testing will adhere to informed
consent laws and protocols for conducting research on human
subjects? As an exercise, review historical examples of unethical
military testing of weapons on human subjects -- for example: Japanese
testing of microbial pathogens on prisoners of war during World War II,
U.S. military testing of poison gas on soldiers during World War II,
U.S. military testing of the effects of atomic bomb detonations
near troops in Operation Tumbler Snapper (1952), Operation Upshot
Knothole (1953), the Smoky Test Shot (1957) and the Galileo Test
Shot (1957).</P>

<P>And if a soldier or volunteer is injured or killed while being
a test subject for such a classified research project, what assurances
exist -- other than the blandishments of Pentagon-Charles-Swett-types --
that proper scientific overview by the unbiased was conducted, or
that his family will even be able to find out what occurred during
a particular experiment?</P>

<P>AN "UNDERGROUND" BOOK ON AUSTRALIAN HACKERS BURNS THE MIND</P>

<P>Crypt News reads so many bad books, reports and news pieces
on hacking and the computing underground that it's a real
pleasure to find a writer who brings genuine perception to
the subject.  Suelette Dreyfus is such a writer, and
"Underground," published by the Australian imprint, Mandarin,
is such a book.</P>

<P>The hacker stereotypes perpetrated by the mainstream media include
descriptions which barely even fit any class of real homo sapiens
Crypt News has met.  The constant regurgitation of idiot slogans
-- "Information wants to be free," "Hackers are just people who
want to find out how things work" -- insults the intelligence.
After all, have you ever met anyone who wouldn't want their
access to information to be free or who didn't admit to some
curiosity about how the world works?  No -- of course not.
Dreyfus' "Underground" is utterly devoid of this manner of
patronizing garbage and the reader is the better for it.</P>

<P>"Underground" is, however, quite a tale of human frailty.
It's strength comes not from the feats of hacking it portrays --
and there are plenty of them -- but in the emotional and physical
cost to the players. It's painful to read about people like
Anthrax, an Australian 17-year old trapped in a dysfunctional
family. Anthrax's father is abusive and racist, so the son --
paradoxically -- winds up being a little to much like him for
comfort, delighting in victimizing complete strangers with mean
jokes and absorbing the anti-Semitic tracts of Louis Farrakhan.
For no discernible reason, the hacker repetitively baits
an old man living in the United States with harassing telephone
calls. Anthrax spends months of his time engaged in completely
pointless, obsessed hacking of a sensitive U.S. military system.
Inevitably, Anthrax becomes entangled in the Australian courts and
his life collapses.</P>

<P>Equally harrowing is the story of Electron whose hacking pales
in comparison to his duel with mental illness. Crypt News
challenges the readers of "Underground" not to squirm at the
image of Electron, his face distorted into a fright mask of
rolling eyes and open mouth due to tardive dyskinesia,
a side-effect of being put on anti-schizophrenic medication.</P>

<P>Dreyfus expends a great deal of effort exploring what happens
when obsession becomes the only driving force behind her
subjects' hacking.  In some instances, "Underground's"
characters degenerate into mental illness, others try to find
solace in drugs.  This is not a book in which the hackers
declaim at any great length upon contorted philosophies in which
the hacker positions himself as someone whose function is a
betterment to society, a lubricant of information flow, or
a noble scourge of bureaucrats and tyrants. Mostly, they hack
because they're good at it, it affords a measure of recognition
and respect -- and it develops a grip upon them which goes beyond
anything definable by words.</P>

<P>Since this is the case, "Underground" won't be popular with
the goon squad contingent of the police corp and computer security
industry.  Dreyfus' subjects aren't the kind that come neatly
packaged in the "throw-'em-in-jail-for-a-few-years-while-awaiting-trial"
phenomenon that's associated with America's Kevin Mitnick-types.
However, the state of these hackers -- sometimes destitute,
unemployable or in therapy -- at the end of their travails is
seemingly quite sufficient punishment.</P>

<P>Some things, however, never change.  Apparently, much of Australia's
mainstream media is as dreadful at covering this type of story as
America's.  Throughout "Underground," Dreyfus includes clippings
from Australian newspapers featuring fabrications and exaggeration
that bare almost no relationship to reality.  Indeed, in one prosecution
conducted within the United Kingdom, the tabloid press whipped the
populace into a blood frenzy by suggesting a hacker under trial could
have affected the outcome of the Gulf War in his trips through U.S.
computers.</P>

<P>Those inclined to seek the unvarnished truth will find "Underground"
an excellent read.  Before each chapter, Dreyfus presents a snippet
of lyric chosen from the music of Midnight Oil.  It's an elegant
touch, but I'll suggest a lyric from another Australian band,
a bit more obscure, to describe the spirit of "Underground."
From Radio Birdman's second album: "Burned my eye, burned my mind, I
couldn't believe it . . . "</P>

<P>MEMOIRS FOUND IN A THINK TANK BATHTUB</P>


<P>Stanislaw Lem's "Memoirs Found in a Bathtub" tells the story of
a future in which one man is driven to suicide after
wandering endlessly in an underground fortress modelled on
the Pentagon. "The reader will witness how the fanatical
servants of Kap-Eh-Taal created the myth of the Antibuilding, how
they spent their lives in mutual surveillance, in tests of loyalty
and devotion to the Mission, even when the last figment of the
Mission's reality had become an impossibility and nothing
remained but to sink ever deeper into the pit of collective
madness," Lem writes in the introduction. The Antibuilding is, of
course, the "enemy" -- anyone not an insider in Lem's future Pentagon.
Inside Lem's military-industrial fortress-gone-mad everyone is either
dangerously clueless or suffering from weird delusions.  In this
world, existence is static. Paranoid fantasies are the lingua franca
and no reality intrudes.</P>

<P>Although Lem's story was satire -- an extended joke -- it made
for excellent reading. Sometimes the declarations of think tank
national security mandarins in service to the Department of
Defense are like Stanislaw Lem's fantastic tales -- good reading,
especially if you peruse them in a satirical state of mind.</P>

<P>The Hudson Institute, founded in 1961 by one of the prototypes for
Dr. Strangelove -- Herman Kahn, recently burped out something fit
for a fictional appendix to Lem's "Memoirs Found in a Bathtub."
Although Kahn is dead, his legacy of Cold War-flavored national
security study is still very much alive at Hudson. For example, it
should be noted that ex-NSA chief (circa 1985) William Odom is its
current director of security studies.</P>

<P>And so it is in this rarefied atmosphere that Mary C. FitzGerald,
one of the institute's research fellows, a self-confessed "computer
illiterate," came to write about a subject she called "Russian
Views on Electronic and Information Warfare."</P>

<P>The Russians, she wrote recently, are planning on using computer
viruses delivered over the Net or through laser transmission
to smite telephone networks, the control suites of ballistic missile
sites and air traffic controller equipment. As proof of the veracity
of the plan, FitzGerald cites the story of a computer virus, written
by the U.S. military, that struck down the Iraqi air defense network
in the Gulf War.</P>

<P>The only trouble with this particular story is that it is, indeed,
only that. In fact, it's one of the more persistent myths about
computer viruses.</P>

<P>In FitzGerald's report, it reads like this:</P>

<P>"For example, one cannot exclude the use of software inserts in
imported gear used in the Iraqi air defense system for
blocking it at the beginning of the war." And a few paragraphs
on, ". . . Iraq could not use the air defense systems bought in
France . . . Their software contained logic bombs that were
activated with the start of hostilities."</P>

<P>This particular legend was the result of an April Fool's hoax
run amok. Appearing in an April 1991 issue of Infoworld magazine,
the Gulf War virus story was a cleverly written joke by reporter
John Gantz who called it "totally a spoof." Gullible editors at US
News & World Report bit hard and paved it over as a hot scoop. The
news magazine subsequently immortalized it in its 1992 book on the
conflict, "Triumph Without Victory." Since then it's also been
passed on in a number of official U.S. Department of Defense
documents.</P>

<P>Unsurprisingly, FitzGerald refused to believe it was an April
Fool's joke. The Russians believed it, she said.  Experts from
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory believed it -- she said.
Representatives from Northrop Grumman were coming to visit her
because of this paper, FitzGerald said.</P>

<P>"If you think this is a myth why don't you just write an article
and get it published by the New York Times," FitzGerald commented
tartly. (Actually, Crypt had called to interview her about this for
an article in the Netly News on TIME magazine's Pathfinder Net
site, not the Times.)</P>

<P>"I don't think it's a myth, based on not only what the Russians say,
but on what our people say," FitzGerald added.</P>

<P>FitzGerald's paper is quite detailed, lengthy reading.  Portions of it
address subjects Crypt Newsletter readers have grown quite
fond of.</P>

<P>For example, the use of psychic divination for military intelligence
collection is discussed.</P>

<P>"Presently, one can single out four basic directions of military-applied
research in the field of bio-energy.  First, elaboration of methods of
intentionally influencing a person's psychic activities.  The second
direction includes an in-depth study of paranormal phenomena that are
of greatest interest from the standpoint of possible
military use -- clairvoyance, telekinesis, telepathic hypnosis, and so
forth," writes FitzGerald.</P>

<P>"The framework of this phenomenon is quite broad:  on a strategic scale, it
is possible to penetrate the enemy's main command-and-control facilities
[with the clairvoyant scout] to become familiar with his classified
documents; on the tactical level, reconnaissance can be
conducted on the battlefield and in the enemy's rear area (the 
'clairvoyant-scout' will always be located at a safe place).  However,
problems do exist -- the number of individuals possessing these abilities
is limited, and the data received cannot be checked."</P>

<P>Which would seem indisputable.</P>

<P>Telepathic warriors, non-lethal weapons, emp guns, and
fantastic applications of science such as the battlefield use of
anti-matter and creation of earthquakes and tidal waves with bombs
of cataclysmic power are also touched upon by FitzGerald's paper.</P>

<P>"['Geophysical weapons'] are weapons that generate natural catastrophes
such as earthquakes, torrential rains, tsunamis, and destruction of the
ozone layer.  It is possible to trigger earthquakes with underground
explosions of powerful nuclear charges . . ." writes FitzGerald of the
"Russians" and their alleged belief in the military practicality
of earthquake bombs.</P>

<P>And, "According to Russian military experts, using psychokinesis to
destroy command-and-control systems and disrupt the functioning of
strategic arms is already feasible," writes the Hudson researcher, in
a vein similar to John B. Alexander, the former Los Alamos non-lethal
weapons and paranormal guru.</P>

<P>"The ability of a human organism to emit a certain type of energy
has been confirmed by photography of a radiation field known as the
Kirlian effect. Psychokinesis is explained by the subject's generation
of an electromagnetic force capable of moving or destroying some object.
Studies of objects destroyed as a result of [paranormal] experiments
conducted have shown a different form of breakage than under the
effect of physical force," reads the Hudson Institute paper.</P>

<P>Further, "Discovering the mechanisms of controlling telepathic
hypnosis will make it possible to conduct a direct transfer of
thoughts from one person or group of people (telepathic subjects) to
a selected audience . . . For example, personnel of an enemy formation
executing a sudden breakthrough of defenses, instead of exploiting the
success, will try to consolidate on the line achieved or even return to
the starting line."</P>

<P>Correct!  Enemy formations will be defeated by telepathic command.</P>

<P>"Many 'Western experts,' including military analysts, assume that
the country making the first decisive breakthrough in this field
will gain a superiority over its enemy that is comparable only with
the monopoly of nuclear weapons.  In the future, these types of weapons
may become the cause of illness or death of an object (person),
and without any risk to the life of the operator (person emitting the
command). Psychotronic weapons are silent, difficult to detect, and
require the efforts of one or several operators as a source of power.
Therefore, scientific and military circles abroad are very concerned
over a possible 'psychic invasion' . . . " writes FitzGerald.</P>

<P>FitzGerald also writes the Russians have commenced research on a
"biological electronic device" -- a machine that not only communicates
in human language but also is "an artificial biological field
generator," "a bio-electronic transceiver," and a "holographic 
laser."</P>

<P>"Research has shown that a BED is capable of sensing the specifics of
biological radiation from diseased human organs, of influencing the
physical and chemical processes taking place within the organism, and
of revealing the connections between the cortex and subcortex of the
brain.  A BED detects a diseased organ, receives its signal, boosts it
many times over, and creates a field of the given type of radiation with
a large effective range," FitzGerald writes.</P>

<P>Crypt Newsletter translates: A BED is not something you sleep in,
it's a killer computing machine that talks, can survey diseased organs
and project the electromagnetic field they radiate into someone else,
rendering them sick or dead.</P>

<P>Information warriors at the USAF's College of Aerospace Doctrine
at Maxwell AFB in Alabama have coined the term "fictive environment" to
describe what happens when bogus tales are spun to deceive the enemy
during Net war. Ironically, FitzGerald is also an adjunct professor at
Maxwell. At Crypt News, we don't call this "fictive environment." We call
it being gored by your own bull.</P>

<P>====================</P>

<P><I>Afterwords:</I></P>

<P>1. The trotting out of urban legends-as-fact as well as telepathy,
superweapon mythology and the paranormal in military application in
<I>non-fiction</I> is hardly new.  For that matter, neither is the idea that
"the Russians" are interested in cataclysmic transformation of the
environment.  Alvin and Heidi Toffler, for example, write about these
subjects in much the same manner as Mary C. FitzGerald in the book
"War & Anti-War."</P>

<P>On page 96 of "War and Anti-War" one can find the entertainingly
entitled section <I>"Toward Military Telepathy."</I> In it, the time-honored
stratagem of argument from authority -- by the way, also employed in
"Russian Views in Electronic and Information Warfare" -- is used to
give credence to crack-pot material.  In this case, an American general,
Sidney Schachnow of the Special Operations Command, is caught mumbling
about the development of "synthetic telepathy" by the year 2020. Further,
on page 123, in another section divertingly called "Super
Plagues," the Tofflers attribute the ingenious plan of melting
the ice cap over the Arctic Ocean to Lenin.</P>

<P>--------------------------------</P>

<P>MORE MEMOIRS FOUND IN A BATHTUB</P>

<P>Lest you begin to think that technological fictions and the mania
for paranormal or mind-blowing military applications in direct
contravention of common sense that we've read of in this issue are
restricted to only a few fringe DoD publications, consider another
example harvested from the Joint Chiefs of Staff by a recent
Crypt News FOIA request.</P>

<P>In the spirit of the times, "Information Warfare: Legal, Regulatory,
Policy and Organizational Considerations for Assurance" (published
July 1996) speaks of a number of "information warfare technologies"
which appear to exist only in the minds of the people who dreamed
up the terms for them.</P>

<P>"Computing with DNA molecules," "protein-based computer,"
"nanomanipulator" -- these are a few of "emerging technologies"
which, of course, will be or could be weapons of information war.
The Joint Staff document gives no explanation for any of them.</P>

<P>Typically, at least one urban legend is rolled out as fact. And, so,
in the Joint Staff paper, on page 107 under "Adversary Capabilities" the
emp weapons "from Russia" chupacabras flashes its goat-sucking teeth.
The source, as is common in these cases, is unsupported by recognizable
citation. It's also conflated with a partial quote from Boris Yeltsin that
actually has nothing specifically to do with electromagnetic pulse -- an
argument from authority strategy.</P>

<P>"Marketing materials from Russia offer a wide range of Electromagnetic
Pulse weaponry, from hand grenades to mortars.  Printed advertisements
show the weapons being utilized in several different environments,
from office settings to commercial airports," reads the Joint Staff
report. "Boris Yeltsin recently stated that 'While maintaining our
nuclear potential at the proper level, we need to devote more
attention to developing the entire range of means of information
warfare . . ."</P>

<P>Pro forma usage in these types of reports also requires that
threats, be they electromagnetic pulse hand grenades or Gulf War
winning computer viruses, always be attributed to uncited sources,
"the Russians," anonymous authors among the Joint Chiefs,
"advertisements," "marketing materials," "emerging technologies,"
and/or "new physical principles." (The latter is commonly brandished
by writers with zero scientific training). Anything squishy will
serve but <I>never</I> precisely identifiable sources, or thorough technical
papers written in clear English and published in mainstream,
independent peer-reviewed scientific journals.</P>

<P>This Joint Chiefs of Staff info-war report is credited as a proxy
effort by Science Applications International Corporation, a firm
that is very aggressively involved in selling info-war protection to
the Department of Defense.</P>

<P>---------------</P>

<P>ON MEDIA HACKS AND HACKERS: THE TROUBLE WITH JOURNALISTS IS . . .
THEY JUST WON'T STOP</P>

<P>In as fine a collection of stereotypes as can be found, the
Associated Press furnished a story on July 14 covering the annual
DefCon hacker get together in Las Vegas. It compressed at least
one hoary cliche into each paragraph.</P>

<P>Here is a summary of them.</P>

<P>The lead sentence: "They're self-described nerds . . . "</P>

<P>Then, in the next sentence, "These mostly gawky, mostly male
teen-agers . . . also are the country's smartest and slyest computer
hackers."</P>

<P>After another fifty words, "These are the guys that got beat up in
high school and this is their chance to get back . . . "</P>

<P>Add a sprinkling of the obvious: "This is a subculture of
computer technology . . ."</P>

<P>Stir in a paraphrased hacker slogan: "Hacking comes from an
intellectual desire to figure out how things work . . ."</P>

<P>A whiff of crime and the outlaw weirdo: "Few of these wizards will
identify themselves because they fear criminal prosecution . . .  a
25-year-old security analyst who sports a dog collar and nose ring, is
cautious about personal information."</P>

<P>Close with two bromides that reintroduce the stereotype:</P>

<P>"Hackers are not evil people. Hackers are kids."</P>

<P>As a simple satirical exercise, Crypt News rewrote the Associated
Press story as media coverage of a convention of newspaper editors.</P>

<P>It looked like this:</P>

<P>LAS VEGAS -- They're self-described nerds, dressing in starched
white shirts and ties.</P>

<P>These mostly overweight, mostly male thirty, forty and
fiftysomethings are the country's best known political pundits,
gossip columnists and managing editors. On Friday, more than 1,500 of
them gathered in a stuffy convention hall to swap news and network.</P>

<P>"These are the guys who ate goldfish and dog biscuits at frat parties
in college and this is their time to strut," said Drew Williams,
whose company, Hill & Knowlton, wants to enlist the best editors
and writers to do corporate p.r.</P>

<P>"This is a subculture of corporate communicators," said Williams.</P>

<P>Journalism comes from an intellectual desire to be the town crier
and a desire to show off how much you know, convention-goers said.
Circulation numbers and ad revenue count for more than elegant prose
and an expose on the President's peccadillos gains more esteem from
ones' peers than klutzy jeremiads about corporate welfare and
white-collar crime.</P>

<P>One group of paunchy editors and TV pundits were overheard
joking about breaking into the lecture circuit, where one
well-placed talk to a group of influential CEOs or military
leaders could earn more than many Americans make in a year.</P>

<P>Few of these editors would talk on the record for fear of
professional retribution. Even E.J., a normally voluble
45-year-old Washington, D.C., editorial writer, was reticent.</P>

<P>REUTERS -- INSTRUMENT OF CORPORATE SHILLS</P>

<P><I>Reuters</I>: an international misinformation vendor.</P>

<P>Usage:  By merely changing the use of pronouns within a company
promotion, <I>Reuters</I> often swindled its readers in passing off
press releases as original news.</P>

<P>---from the "<I>JOSEPH K GUIDE TO TECH TERMINOLOGY</I>"</P>


<P>Late in August, Reuters passed an Iris Anti-virus press release
as breaking news.  The Iris promotion was hooked to an alert
about the OneHalf computer virus, a bug that's now close to three
years old.</P>

<P>One of the giveaways was the quote of Iris' marketing manager,
Alan Komet, as a technical expert on viruses. In this case, Reuters
paraphrased a discussion attributed to Komet on the virus' somewhat
unusual ability to encrypt the cylinders of an infected hard disk.</P>

<P>While the average American user has a statistically more likely
probability of being smashed flat by a runaway Peterbilt outside
his home than infection by OneHalf in 1997, the Reuters piece
was written -- like the Iris press release -- to create the
impression that only the anti-virus company's software could remove
the virus and that it was significant threat to users. Neither
are true.</P>

<P>The use of OneHalf as an Iris anti-virus marketing tool was hooked
to a new set of promotions for the company's software undertaken in
cooperation with US Robotics, Dell, Packard Bell and CompuServe.</P>

<P>IT'S ABOUT TIME, IT'S ABOUT SPACE, IT'S ABOUT A MAN IN A FUNNY
PLACE</P>

<P>by Stephen M. Poole</P>


<P>Telling time should be a relatively simple thing, should it not?
After all, we've been doing it for thousands of years -- so why are we
facing a Year 2000 problem?</P>

<P>Is it, as one investment advisor insisted a few months ago, that we
programmers just don't know what we're doing?</P>

<P>I don't think so.  I don't think we programmers can be blamed for 
this one.</P>

<P>It's the blamed computers themselves.</P>

<P>For some reason, the concept of Time 0 is important to a computer.
It's not enough that a computer knows that I'm typing this at 1:50
AM on 08-03-97, way past my bed time -- I've already turned into a
pumpkin.  A computer must have a Reference.  He must know when
<I>Time Began</I>.</P>

<P>The problem is, time begins at different . . . well, times.</P>

<P>Under Windows, for example, there are several different ways to measure
time. First, there's "DOSTime," which is hours, minutes, and seconds
squeezed into a single 16-bit number, based on 1980 as Year 0.  Then
there's "NetTime," which is the number of milliseconds since 
01/01/1970.</P>

<P>(Apple has a really good one: Their networks use the year 2000 as
time 0, so right now, all times in the system are actually NEGATIVE
numbers.  Shoulda known Apple'd be different . . .)</P>

<P>But my personal favorite is  "Win32Time," which is a 64-bit number
containing the number of 100 nanosecond intervals since January 1st,
1601.</P>

<P>Yes, you read that right.  The number of 100 NANOSECOND intervals since
1/1/1601.  No Year 2,000 problem here!</P>

<P>Now, Win32 time would appear to be the ultimate in TechnoGeek Time
Measurement, especially given that the average PC's clock is only
accurate to within a few minutes, at best.  But even it won't be enough
to forestall the Year 2000 Problem and the resulting Collapse Of All
Civilization And Life As We Know It, so there's obviously room for
improvement.</P>

<P>Or is there?  Would the cure be worse than the disease?</P>

<P>I thought about proposing a new measurement, BBTime, which would be the
number of femtoseconds since the Big Bang.  But on second thought, I'm
just not sure it'd be worth the cost.</P>

<P>For one thing, it would be controversial.  The Church would probably
insist on something like the number of picoseconds since Adam's creation,
but there'd be sectarian battles in affixing a precise interval to his
birthday.</P>

<P>Of course, should they agree, there could be daily Adam Updates
broadcast so that we could stay on time:  "At the tone, it will have
been 189,345,600,324,568,412,111,245 picoseconds since Creation.
Please synchronize your computer.  <ping>"  Sort of like those
singy-thingy-doods, the muezzins, who stand in those little skinny
towers - in Islamic countries and sing PrayerTime For The Masses -- only
more high tech.</P>

<P>And then the real squabbles would begin.  Women's groups would say that
Time 0 should be based on Eve's creation, not Adam's.  Animal-rights
activists would insist that Adam Time is too anthropocentric, and would
rather have a calendar based from the first butterfly, ARTime.
Vegetarians would want time measured from the first corn nut, VeggieTime.
Pretty soon, you'd have a million different Times, with each group
insisting on its own Time 0.  Clocks would become inaccurate.  School
teachers would become confused.  The government would collapse.  Grocery
stores would run out of milk and Cheezums.  It'd be horrible.</P>

<P>So we should leave well enough alone and stick with Win32 time.  This
means I'll never know <I>precisely</I> when Charlemagne was crowned, but 
what's a little imprecision against the collapse of civilization?</P>

<P>Postscript:</P>

<P>"What time is it?"</P>

<P>"189,345,600,346,132,167,111,200."</P>

<P>"Oh, I'd better hurry, I have a doctor's appointment at
189,345,600,845,569,861,321,400!"</P>

READERS ALSO GREATLY INTERESTED IN CRYPT NEWS' ANALYSES OF EMP
CHUPACABRAS

Hi Crypt:

I've just come across Crypt Newsletter and am in agreement regarding
EMP weapons for alleged bank robberies. You would be incinerated if
you had a gun capable of performing as advertised against banks, cars,
etc.

I do wonder about one thing, though.  I stumbled upon a number of
abstracts written by scientists working on HAARP-related projects.
Reading between the lines, I would guess that the true purpose of
HAARP is to scramble the electronics of incoming hostiles, probably
missiles.

Here's the source of some of the abstracts (look for "Intense Microwave
and Particle Beams II"):

Hi Crypt:

Your newsletter is always a great read and I think it's good that
you are debunking so much of the crap that people are coming up
with in these fields.

You might be interested in [Carlo] Kopp's paper on EMP Bombs, which,
if you haven't seen it, provides some interesting details about possible
technologies, confirming your stance that an EMP weapon would probably
cause a reasonable amount of localized physical destruction.

The URL is http://www.cdsar.af.mil/kopp/apjemp.html

I do wonder what impact superconducting technology might have in
this area though . . .

Anyway, keep up the good work !

STILL MORE ON EMP


Crypt:

I suggest some of your data on emp guns is exaggerated.  High-power
microwave weapons, sometimes included in that population by the less
informed, DO exist and I can provide photographs if necessary!

I recommend visiting my site at www.dallas.net/~pevler for a discussion
of the threat these weapons pose society.  I welcome any public or
private debate on the topic.

KAFKA FAN ENJOYS JOSEPH K GUIDE


Dear Crypt:

I have long been an ardent fan of the Crypt Newsletter and its
ongoing -- albeit despairingly futile -- quest to keep public
discourse on the Internet bullshit-free.  Until today, however, I
had never experienced your "JOSEPH K" GUIDE: AN OCCASIONAL GLOSSARY
TO TECH TERMINOLOGY.  Holy cow -- what a riot!

This is (other than just about any Microsoft press release) one of the
funniest things I've ever read on the Net.  You hardly seem to be the
self-aggrandizing sort, but I think it would be a favor to your
readership if you could find some way to plug this _excellent_ feature
of your website.  (If you don't have the time to think anything else up,
feel free to do so by way of this unabashed testimonial.)

Best wishes,

Will keep you updated on how we are dealing with similar problems on

main library building is named for John Henry Faulk because of his
efforts on behalf of free speech.
