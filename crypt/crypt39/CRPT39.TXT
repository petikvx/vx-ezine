CRYPT NEWSLETTER'S "JOSEPH K" GUIDE: AN OCCASIONAL GLOSSARY TO TECH
TERMINOLOGY


      "This is not a psychotic episode, it is a cleansing moment
      of clarity."

               --Howard Beal in Paddy Chayefsky's "Network"


computer virus: a small replicating computer program designed to
spread autonomously; or, a marketing tool used by computer security
experts and anti-virus software companies; or, something indeterminate
responsible for making any computer or network behave weirdly.

Usage:  Angered by the mystifying and increasingly nettlesome crashes
of his new WIN95-equipped computer, Loy suspected a _computer virus_.


content:  an amorphous term encompassing material of utterly no
value found on World Wide Web sites.

Usage: The mouthpiece for a conglomerate of entertainment magazines,
whose readership encompassed a great number of gossip-hungry simpletons,
vowed his company's Web site would be _content_ rich.


cybercash: a fuzzy concept glossy magazines and Internet flacks claim
will make everyone -- except maybe you -- wealthy in cyberspace. Not to
be confused with cash money.

Usage:  Wackerman dreamed of the _cybercash_ riches he would reap
from the sale of his electronic story of a shy but brilliant software
engineer who saves the country from destruction at the hands of
international terrorists and information warriors.


digerati: the celebrities of the 'Net and/or computing industry; or,
Robert Reich's "symbolic analysts." [But that's another tale].

Usage:  While the press releases and treatises of the _digerati_
were of less value to the average American than a plate of singing
maggots, the mainstream media always loved them.


electronic bogeyman: a hacker, instrument of a hacker or anonymous
source portrayed in the mainstream media as a menace to society.
The electronic bogeyman must always be quoted making grandiose,
unverifiable, or nutty claims (e.g., opening all the automatic
garage doors in Anaheim, California at precisely 2:00 pm) about feats,
usually malicious, that can be performed with a computer.

Usage:  Reuters interviewed an _electronic bogeyman_ from Taiwan who
claimed his computer virus would corrupt data on Japanese
computers if that country did not immediately surrender ownership of
the Daioyu Islands in the East China Sea.


fictive environment:  a new description for psychological operations
against an enemy; or, the creation of a world of information fraud
surrounding consumers, marks or targets.

Usage:  In the mid-Nineties, the business of a significant number of
Americans armed with computers became the spinning of
_fictive environments_, the aim of which was to defraud others of
cash money.


Golden Pizzle of Information: any authority figure accustomed to being
publicized unquestioningly; or, computer experts fond of making dumbly
obvious, fraudulent, indecipherable or insane statements which few
dare to seriously question.

Usage: Assuming the leaden mantle of _Golden Pizzle of Information_,
Vice Chairman Gary Fernandes of EDS Corp. told a rapt audience, "We
have technical clutter. We speak in buzzwords and acronyms."


Good Times virus: A hoax believed to be true by many computer-using
Americans.

Usage:  Modzelewski was written up by for insubordination after laughing
indiscreetly at a meeting in which the esteemed network consultant
passed out memos on _Good Times_.


hacker: n.  In this context, a young man very adept with computers
and networks, possibly a pawn of Libya or North Korea.

Usage: Indeed it was good the _hacker_ had been apprehended in his
single apartment in Raleigh because the government feared he was
only a step away from bringing down the entire system of international
banking.


HERF weapon: n. Always suspected but never seen, the HERF - or
High Energy Radio Frequency - gun is responsible for much
nettlesome corporate computer failure nationwide, according to
information warriors.

Usage: Dodson was relieved the computer security guru had been able
to convince management that the corrupted data on the network was the
work of an _HERF weapon_ attack on the corporation, not the boobytrapped
pornographic bit of software he had obtained from alt.sex.watersports.


information warfare: n. In this context, everything and nothing.
What hackers, Libyan agents, rogue nation-states, international
criminals, and pannational groups of religious fundamentalists
will conduct against America in the near future.

Usage:  America On-Line was besieged by a series of vexing and
seemingly pointless _information warfare_ attacks conducted by
teenage hackers armed with AOL Hell, a program that automated the
sending of scrofulous electronic messages to other customers.


interactive: an adjective used to adorn computer and software products
that are intrinsically worthless, unusable or both.

Usage:  "Our _interactive_ Web browser is the only one that can unlock
the magic of the Internet, revivify your moribund sex life, order
your office activities, protect your children from pedophiles, and run
a Ponzi scheme on the Usenet -- all at the same time," burbled
Patty Stonesi, head of Microsoft's Multimedia Division.


mentufactury:  A kind of pompous term for bullshitting, especially the
variety associated with flacking for your information business, hardware,
software or the Internet.

Usage:  In the mid-Nineties, _mentufactury_ became the primary export
of American business resulting in a startling trade deficit disaster.


meta-data: see pseudo-data


paradigm: n. pattern, an example, a model.

Usage: The pronouncements of Bill Gates were the _paradigm_ for
the impenetrable phlogiston surrounding much of home and business
computing.


phlogiston:  an imaginary element formerly believed to cause
combustion; or, Crypt Newsletter's euphemism for what comes out of
the south end of the bull; or, a primary American export commodity
(see mentufactury).

Usage: Not even the powerful American newsmedia could rival the
Usenet in the dissemination of _phlogiston_.


pseudo-data: text, test results, charts, bar graphs, numbers and
statistics produced by the convergence of mentufactury and technoquack.
Sometimes known as advertising.

Usage: The driven and deeply neurotic marketing employees of the
computer industry often tyrannized consumers with fraudulent and
confusing broadcasts of _pseudo-data_ disguised as information.


Reuters: an international misinformation vendor.

Usage:  A Reuters wire news story told of a computer virus factory
discovered on the dark side of the Moon by business security consultants,
Krakt & Zane.


technoquack: an individual, e.g. a consultant or member of the Alvin
Toffler Wehrmacht, who specializes in mentufactury; or, the speechifying
of a technoquack or someone who hasn't quite become one yet.

Usage: The _technoquack_ from the MIT Media Lab enjoyed annoying readers
of his books with periodic declarations that Americans yearned for more
advertising disguised as news, not less.

USING THE GOOD TIMES HOAX TO DETERMINE IF YOUR COMPANY IS DOOMED

In 1994, an article was distributed on on-line services and through
the Internet on the menace of something called Good Times.  Good
Times was a cleverly worded hoax: A whale of a tale of a virus
travelling in electronic mail.  The hoax urgently claimed that if
you received any mail with the title "Good Times," you were not
to open it or your PC's disk would be pffffft, courtesy of the virus.

It was nonsense but it didn't stop thousands of people from
believing it.  And now Good Times is the story that won't go away.
Every week Crypt News sees or receives a few queries from office-computing
information systems jockeys worked into a lather over the Good Times hoax.

Since Good Times is patently false and many people have been working
to debunk it, Crypt believes that in 1996 the hoax is a good barometer
of a subtle disconnect between the use of computing technology
in American business and knowledge of it.

In other words, it's a barometer of corporate dysfunction.

If your company is suffering from Good Times hoaxes its management
and information systems staff can no longer distinguish fairy tales
from reality as long as the language both are conveyed in is similar.
Crypt News believes you can tell if your company is inevitably doomed
depending upon the level of this dysfunction. And it has devised a test
you can take to determine whether or not its time to get out before
the bulkheads collapse.

Get your pencil and paper, because here we go:


1. Estimate how many warning memos you receive or have received
on Good Times or a hoax that's paraphrased from it.

         a. One a month. (This is a very bad indicator. Consider
         skipping to end of quiz at once.)       +100 points.

         b. Perhaps once or twice a year.        +20  points.

         c. More than b but less than a.         +30  points.

         d. None. (You may wish to skip quiz; you
         could be in good shape.)                  0  points.


2. You think that Good Times:

        a. Is true.  I saw something in a movie that was like
        it once.                                 +100 points

        b. Could be true. If management says this is something
        to look out for, then there must be something to it.

                                                 +50  points

        c. Of course it isn't true!  However when I get a message
        on Good Times, I pass it on to management and information
        systems in my company because they'll think it's true and I enjoy
        watching them fruitlessly scurry about.

                                                 +50  points.


        d. It isn't true!                          0  points.


3. When a Good Times warning is spread through the company,

        a. Management or information systems convenes a meeting
        and assigns a group to "research" the threat. Then nothing
        happens or choice "c" [below].

                                                       +100 points

        b. Management or information systems convenes a meeting
        and assigns one person to "research" the threat.
        "Research" means collecting gossip, apocrypha and anecdotes
        from the Internet or commercial on-line services. This
        detritus has nothing to do with the real problem.
        Then nothing happens, anyway.

                                                       +40 points

        c. Workers are compelled to rush about firing up anti-virus
        software.  In the confusion, some hard disks are erased
        or corrupted and the network falls over. This convinces
        everyone Good Times is real.

                                                       +100 points

        d. Nothing happens.  Management is already paralyzed by
        other matters.
                                                        +30 points

        e. Nothing happens because everyone already knows Good
        Times is a hoax.
                                                         0  points


4. In computer, Internet and on-line training sessions at my
   company

         a. The instructors passed around the original Good Times
         hoax and believed it to be real.
                                                      +120 points

         b. Training, what training?                  +50  points

         c. Nothing was said about Good Times.        +20  points

         d. The Good Times scare was explained as a
         hoax.                                          0  points


5. In my company, with regards to Good Times and frightening stories
   concerning computing technology I believe management and/or
   information systems is

         a. Totally incompetent and the personnel never listen to
         anyone but sycophants.

                                                     +120  points

         b. Incompetent but open to suggestions or outside information.

                                                     +50   points

         c. Competent but the personnel never listen to anyone but
         sycophants.

                                                     +50  points

         d. Competent and flexible.

                                                       0  points


Scoring:

         Less than 120 points.
         ====================

         Your firm is not doomed.  However, proximity to the tripwire of
         120 points may be a cause for concern.  A high score in questions
         three or five spells trouble coming every day.

         120-200 points.
         ===============

         Your firm is doomed.  Management is ignorant of basic realities
         in computing technology, is resistant to real education and
         vexes employees with useless work resulting from its own
         ignorance.

         If you are in an educational system, the bureaucracy may
         not -- immediately -- be doomed but a majority of the
         students that are the product of the system are probably
         doomed.

         Special cases: If you work in a government organization,
         it's not doomed.


         More than 200 points.
         ====================

         Special caseload of doom. Not only is the firm doomed
         but so are you!  You are probably already suffering from
         stress-related illness or depression brought on by
         prolonged exposure to too many idiots in the workplace.



RHODE ISLAND WOMAN CHARGED AS ALLEGED COMPUTER VIRUS WIELDING SABOTEUR

On September 26, charges were filed against a female employee of Textron in
Providence, Rhode Island, in connection with alleged infection of the
company network with a computer virus.

Covered in the October 1 issue of the Providence Journal-Bulletin as
"Computer expert faces charge of putting virus in Textron's system,"
Denise M. Johnson was named in an investigation centering around charges
she had sent an "e-mail message" to all users at the company and that
the process corrupted the network with a virus.

Quite naturally, the invocation of "e-mail virus" always raises the
eyebrows of the skeptical at Crypt Newsletter.

In any case, Johnson was arrested and charged with . . . what appear to
be indeterminate crimes.  According to the Providence-Journal,
Johnson was charged with destruction of computer data, a felony.
According to District Court records, she was charged with "intentional
computer access" -- whatever that is. Johnson denied the accusations
and attributed the arrest to a politically-motivated hatchet job
instigated by the company.

"I'm not a virus queen, I'm not a hacker. They're trumping up these
charges," she told the Journal.

Johnson said to the paper that Textron's computers had been infected with
computer viruses "for months" and the system's crash was due to a
"virus [that] was already in the system."

According to the Journal, investigating police "said officials at . . .
Textron headquarters saw [Johnson] on Sept. 17 sending the message
containing the pernicious program."

This caused the loss of "computer data stored [at Textron] from 11 p.m.
on Sept. 16 to 2 p.m. on Sept. 17."

Johnson was a computer help-desk worker alleged to unhappy with her
employment at Textron. On the 17th, Johnson had a meeting
with a manager in which she said she was leaving the company.  At
this time, she was said by authorities to have launched the virus.

Bail was set at $10,000 and Johnson was subsequently released.
The next court action on the case is scheduled for December 5.



CONTRIBUTE A BOOK TO THE JOHN MCAFEE AWARDS 1996 AND STRIKE A BLOW
FOR COMPUTER LITERACY; BE CONSIDERED A SWELL GUY, TOO

Crypt Newsletter and Computer Virus Myths guru Rob Rosenberger
have put their heads together to comb the media for computer virus
stories that have contributed the most to computer virus misinformation
and confusion in 1996.  Once they've been compiled, we'll put them on
display along with analyses of their impact and faults and throw the
nominees open to Netizens for their votes on which are the best, or
worst, depending on your point of view.

Rob has puckishly named the contest the 1996 John McAfee Awards
after the 1992 watershed event of Michelangelo hype that catapulted
the anti-virus software developer to fame and fortune -- his
former company to a dominant position in the anti-virus industry.

But we want this to be an exercise in extending computer literacy
and to that end we intend to give away some prizes -- namely books!
Here's where you -- authors, publishers, the pure of heart and
philanthropic -- come in. Contribute one book on computer security,
computer viruses or reality and culture in cyberspace and we'll be
forever in your debt. You'll get publicity when we mention your
philanthropy and book during the nominations, voting and awards
ceremony.  Plus you'll have the satisfaction of knowing your book
is going to be placed directly into the hands of someone in the media
who needs it the most!

To contribute a book, contact me or Rob Rosenberger.

George Smith:    crypt@sun.soci.niu.edu
Rob Rosenberger: us@kumite.com

On November 1 we'll publicize the nominees and the prizes so the
voting can begin.  Watch this space for further details.

ROOT, HOG, OR DIE: MCAFEE ASSOCIATES ACCUSES SYMANTEC OF FRAUD IN
ANTI-VIRUS CATFIGHT

If you've been following Crypt Newsletter you know the anti-virus
industry is a mutually antagonistic, factious business where everybody
wakes up hoping everybody else has failed the night before.

So the recent catfight between McAfee Associates and Symantec over the 
performance - or lack of it - of the Norton Anti-virus
is just another turd in the punchbowl of the corporate security
industry.

The fight started when the United Kingdom-based trade publication, Secure 
Computing, published a product run-off that showed the Norton Anti-virus 
to be a rather wretched performer in Word Macro virus detection and 
removal.  Since Word Macro virus infections are the current bugaboo of 
U.S. business, this was bad news for Symantec, indeed.

Then McAfee Associates cried foul. Since Symantec advertises that Norton
Anti-virus removes all Word Macro viruses but a test performed by a
magazine proves it flunks in this regard, advertising for the Norton
Anti-virus is a fraud and should be corrected to reflect this, the
company insisted. A Symantec agent (actually an agent for most
of the anti-virus programs that sell reasonably well, including McAfee's
SCAN) -- Norman Hirsch -- was pilloried by McAfee for publicizing his 
own test's results, with Symantec on top.  There was a great paroxysm of 
garment-rending and gnashing of teeth.

The parties involved danced around the fact that almost every anti-virus
company, at one time or another, has let its marketing department
steamroller the truth and claim its product removes or protects
against all viruses, past, present and future. Since the use of this
practice has been ubiquitous through the Nineties, many consumers have
been conditioned to demand it as a term of service and, paradoxically,
won't buy anti-virus software that doesn't make fraudulent claims about
performance fabricated by sundry hired fiends in the marketing department.
This necessitates the generation of consumer "tests" that certify --
in one way or another -- that various products roughly adhere to claims
put forward by fraudulent advertising.

On his Web site, Hirsch maintained Norton Anti-virus was victimized
by Secure Computing's test. The test was slanted in favor of companies
that have Computer Anti-virus Research Organization (CARO) members
in their technical wings.  Symantec doesn't have a pet CARO member. [1]
Everyone else -- like McAfee -- did.  This meant, wrote Hirsch, that
Symantec doesn't have as easy access to virus samples used in testing
as other developers.

While there is some logic to this argument, in it's strained effort to be
diplomatic it glosses over a simpler explanation based on human nature.
Many CARO members either dislike or actively despise Symantec (if their
gossip at anti-virus conferences is any barometer.)  It would be accurate
to say that some of them don't care if Symantec ever gets all the virus
samples it would like.  And if this is viewed as standing-in-the-way or
indifference, tough.

For example, Glenn Jordan -- a CARO member who maintained Ross
Greenburg's VirexPC program for Datawatch and who is now employed by
Dr. Solomon's, another Symantec competitor -- mentioned at one conference
that Symantec tried to acquire Solomon's but the deal went sour because
Gordon Eubanks, CEO of Symantec was . . . well, Crypt Newsletter won't
reprint it because this is a family-oriented magazine, y'know.

Anyway, in an extended press release distributed by the Business Wire
service in September, McAfee Associates CEO Bill Larson thundered:
"Symantec appears to have repeatedly and blatantly [misled] software
consumers about the capabilities of Norton AntiVirus . . . Once again,
Symantec has tried to fool customers by deliberately exaggerating the
capabilities of Norton AntiVirus.  We call on Gordon Eubanks, Symantec's
CEO, to come clean and own up to - and correct - his company's false
and misleading claims."

The McAfee Associates press release insisted Symantec's advertising
for the Norton Anti-virus "[was] part of a well documented
and intentional international campaign designed to deliberately
mislead software consumers and libel McAfee."

And McAfee took aim at Norman Hirsch, claiming Symantec was publicizing a
test that made its product look good, a test that was commissioned by
the company and performed -- cooked is the implication -- by one of its
agents. "The study upon which Symantec draws its conclusions is fraught
with errors, misleading information, and questionable testing
methodologies," claimed a McAfee rep.

Hirsch maintained his Symantec test was valid; he, an honest broker.  
After all, he was an agent for many anti-virus companies -- not just 
Symantec and including McAfee -- right?

Postscript:  In related news and the "Liar, liar pants on fire!"
department, Rob Rosenberger posted this piquant bit of McAfee 
Associates phlogiston:

"Rick Kreysar -- [a] vice-president of McAfee Associates took part 
in a RealAudio interview [this month] with PC World Online's Brian 
McWilliams. Mind you, we named the Virus Hysteria Awards in honor of 
company founder John McAfee. VP Kreysar suffered a memory lapse during 
the interview:

1. At one time Symantec did have a number of CARO members in

list of viruses in the wild; Kuo now works at McAfee Associates

ANOTHER BRIEF TALE OF INFOWAR KOOKS IN THE WESTERN WORLD

The September 8-15 issue of Defense News magazine featured an
article on information warfare kooks at the Pentagon and elsewhere
in the western world. Coming together at the National Computer Security
Association's annual InfoWar Con in Washington, DC, various political
and military attaches were quoted making amusing and fantastic
claims by reporter Pat Cooper.

One of the best examples was given by the Australian embassy's defense
attache in Washington, air vice marshal Brendan O'Loghlin. O'Loghlin
was reported to say information warfare could be used to destroy enemy
computers through the release or deployment of computer viruses into
foreign networks.

Of course, this will feed more computer virus myths on the effectiveness
of trivial replicating programs as weapons.  It also overlooks the
problem of "blowback," or what happens when a military option imposed
on an enemy blows back over friendly borders and becomes a menace at
home.

Indeed, the entire history of computer viruses shows their epidemiology
is no respecter of diplomatic treaties, allies, or international borders.
Spread of computer viruses is by practical definition uncontrollable.

Does this mean a branch of the Australian military is actually thinking
about writing computer viruses or procuring them as potential weapons?
Hard to say.

But it does raise the question why a politico-military appointee in the
Australian diplomatic corps isn't censured by his home office for
spouting such arrant stupidity in a high profile public forum.

Another trenchant quote was provided to Cooper by Marine General John
Sheehan, head man at Atlantic Command in Norfolk, VA.  Sheehan said
he was getting involved in information warfare because "We don't
want to get our butts kicked by a bunch of long-haired 26-year-olds
with earrings."

And the world of infowar kooks is not without its own evolving jargon,
too, where old phenomena and plans evolve into new words that make no
sense but which serve to hide spoiled old wine in new bottles.

One of the better terms Crypt has seen is "fictive environment."
Coined by infowar kooks at the Air Force College of Aerospace Doctrine
at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, a "fictive environment" is
one created when the U.S. military spams a bogus electronic press
(or a radio or TV broadcast) release on Saddam Hussein kissing a pig
into, say, the Iraqi communications network.  This used to be called
psychological operations but information warfare kooks have cleverly
renamed it "fictive environment," perhaps to avoid being downsized
when the psy-ops budget is cut.

Of course, information warfare kooks in the U.S. military believe
such a stunt would discredit enemy leaders in the eyes of their troops,
causing foreign soldiers to march to our side -- or at least be gripped
by indecision.  The U.S., say the information warfare kooks, is
immune to a "fictive environment" since we have an open society and
no one ever gets taken in by bogus news stories delivered via computer
networks or television broadcast.  The skeptical reader is forgiven for
wondering what planet Department of Defense information warfare kooks
have been living on.


SYNDICATED PC ADVICE COLUMNIST LARRY MAGID:  THREAT OR MENACE?

Lawrence Magid's syndicated September 9 "PC Focus" newspaper column
proved once again the famous computer technology
pitchman is dangerous when left to run amok handing out computer
advice on viruses.

Those who follow this sort of thing may recall Magid's wretched
nostrums for fighting Michelangelo virus in 1992. Besides availing
oneself of anti-virus software, one could activate his
computer "on March 5 and leave it running until March 7" to avoid
trouble. In the same piece Magid wrote computer viruses travel via
bulletin board systems.

"I knew something was up on the morning of August 22 . . . " wrote
Magid in his September 9 treatise.  However, it sure wasn't Larry.

Radio station reporters were calling from around the country to
ask for his advice on Hare Krishna virus, Magid wrote. The
reporters were panicked by the recent hysteria drummed up over
the virus.  Someone had told them, said Magid, not to turn on
the PC on the Hare day.

Viruses cause "data files to slow down . . . others cause your disk to
run out of space," he continued.  Magid's consumer advice on
disk space gobbling viruses qualified as genuine village idiot newspaper
chatter, the type which gives computer journalists a worse rep than
they deserve.

Other zingers from Magid's column included such as: "I've been using
computers and on-line services since 1978, and _as far as I know_
[emphasis added], I've only twice been infected by viruses . . ."

"Until recently, the only likely way to get a virus was to run an
infected program . . ."

Magid prattled on, neatly ignoring all the commonplace boot sector
infectors -- even Stoned, a boot sector infector, which he touches upon
earlier in his piece -- reinforcing the conviction he had no idea what he
was talking about when he sounded the alarm on Michelangelo, yet
another boot sector infector, in 1992.

The best part, however, was saved for last.

Magid wrote he was infected with Word Prank but didn't know it until
he updated his anti-virus software.  Picture this for a moment: Larry
Magid using his bully pulpit of syndication to millions of American
readers to ask them to trust his expert advice on computer viruses
after claiming he'd been infected by Word Prank for an unspecified
period.  Paraphrased -- using Larry Magid's computer virus advice is
somewhat akin to consulting the town hooker on treatment for venereal
disease.

Lawrence Magid: threat or menace?




COLOSTOMY BAGBOY RETURNS TO CIVILIAN LIFE IN OKLAHOMA, REFLECTS
ON SIMPLE PRISON RECREATIONS

Recently, Paskell "Geno" Paris called Crypt to inform readers
he had returned from a two year stay in federal prison in connection
with events that are well known to readers of "The Virus Creation
Labs."

In 1993 Paris travelled under the handle "Colostomy Bagboy" while
lurking on the Fidonet as sysop of the "Oklahoma Institute of
Virus Research" in Oklahoma City. While a Fidonet sysop, Paris engaged
in a well-publicized public feud with Edwin Cleton, a former moderator
of one of the network's "Virus Information" message feeds.

As a computer virus exchange bulletin board sysop, Colostomy Bagboy
edited two issues of the underground publication, Vortex.  Vortex was
a profane, hideously violent e-zine that mixed extreme bad taste
and off-color humor with exhortations to join the author in the
"stylish destruction" of the data of others found in the silicon
vortex -- Paris' euphemism for the world computer network. To most users
accustomed to driving slowly down  the middle lane of the information
highway, Vortex read as evidence that menacing electronic bogeymen lurked
under every rock in cyberspace.  However, like many electronic magazines
from the underground it was exaggerated for effect, talking the talk
and walking the walk of many such underground publications.

Federal and local lawmen indicted and arrested Paris the same year.
He was subsequently convicted on charges apparently unrelated to his
underground persona. A fraud charge stemming from the creation or
usurpation of a false identity and a forgery charge resulting from
attempts to counterfeit treasury bills landed him in prison.  Paris also
maintained computer tampering was also part of the conviction, coming down
from what he claimed was an unsuccessful attempt to access and meddle with
the FBI's National Crime Information Center computer database.

While serving his two year sentence, Paris said he was contacted
by reporters looking for a scoop on the underground world of computer
hacking. However, no stories resulted.  Paris added he was allowed to be
part of a computer club at one of the minimum security facilities -- a
work camp -- where he was incarcerated. In addition, Paris told Crypt
News fisticuffs is a common recreation in American jails.



REVIEWED: COMPUTER VIRUS SUPERTECHNOLOGY 1996 - A $400 BOOK ON
WRITING VIRUSES FOR WIN95

Mark Ludwig's "Computer Virus Supertechnology 1996" (American
Eagle, ISBN 0-929408-16-0) radically ups the ante for those
interested in learning how to write computer viruses.  At $395.00
for about 200 pages, Ludwig has pitched it predominantly to repeat
customers of American Eagle, would-be information warriors at
Pentagon think tanks like Science Applications or MITRE Corp., the
libraries of computer security organizations and a handful of
uncategorizables with too much discretionary cash and time on their
hands. It's an effective sales strategy and, I imagine, covers just about
the entire audience for the book in the United States and a handful
of other countries.

In direct contrast to his $12.95 underground bestseller "The Little
Black Book of Computer Viruses," Ludwig only has to sell a few
hundred copies of "CVS1996" to make a substantial return on investment.
Printed in a run of 500, Ludwig claims to have already sold 60 percent
of the lot.  By the time you are reading this review, presumably
"Computer Virus Supertechnology" will be about sold out.

"CVS1996" focuses on writing viruses that infect Windows95 programs.
It includes on its companion diskette the first one written, called
Boza/Bizatch, which was originally published by the Australian
virus-writing group, VLAD.  Boza never made it into general circulation.
And since its publication -- despite a spurt of crazy stories about
it in the mainstream media -- the current crop of virus writers, in
general, have shown very little interest or ability in turning out
the same hordes of trivial viruses for the new operating system as
is the case with DOS.

Ludwig says this is because the vast majority of virus writers
write their programs as a sort of casual hobby.  They lack the
ability or the patience to crunch the internals of Windows 95
code to the extent required to write functional viruses for the
system.  It's a reasonable claim.  The vast majority of virus
writers are, essentially, Caspar Milquetoasts when it comes to
this type of unusual "work."  They tend to prefer collecting viruses
or fragments of them in large numbers and mounting them as public
collections on bulletin boards or Internet providers; writing
aggressively menacing-sounding electronic press releases; and
cobbling together hacks of any one of the thousands of DOS viruses
already in existence.

This could change writes Ludwig, using the following arguments.  A
number of relatively inexpensive books on the internals of Windows and
Win95 are now in bookstores. These certainly furnish the essentials for
understanding the ins-and-outs of file structures and system functions,
sufficient information for virus-writers intent on the subject.
Further, Ludwig points out DOS appeared in 1981 but the Pakistani Brain
virus -- one of the first to garner widespread notice -- didn't show up
on diskettes at an American university until the mid-Eighties.
And by 1988 there were still only a small number of computer viruses
written for that operating system.  The current virus production glut
is a phenomenon with its roots in the first half of this decade which
tends to obscure the fact DOS virus development didn't happen overnight.
Ludwig implies the groundwork is now there for viruses under Windows95 but
it will be a different cohort of virus-writers who wind up producing them.

But the meat of "CVS1996" is, of course, virus writing instruction
and  Ludwig walks the reader through the design of three of them for
Win95. All of them are "direct action" infectors, which is to say -- as
Ludwig does -- that they're effective as basic demonstrators but
because of their limited strategy in file infection, not likely to
be successful in the wild. The first virus, called Hillary, looks
for Windows95 files with more than 500 bytes of zero fill, or
contiguous empty space in them.  It then writes itself to this
hole and adjusts the host program so that when loaded the virus
gets control first.  Although workable on just about anyone's
PC, it's a reluctant infector -- much like Ludwig's TIMID virus
from "The Little Black Book."

Another virus adds itself as a code section to hosts; the last
one in the book shuffles the host's internal code around before
adding itself to the final product, an effort to make the infection
a little less noticeable.  The bulk of the virus tutorials are
spent detailing the internal structures of the average Windows 95
program and the way in which a virus has to modify them
to infect the file without ruining it or crashing the machine.

The final section of "CVS1996" is devoted to Robert Morris, Jr.'s
Internet Worm.  The Worm was unleashed on a computer in MIT's
Artificial Intelligence lab in 1988. In a couple of hours it
was paralyzing computers on the Internet from coast to coast.
Morris confessed to it, was tried, convicted and sentenced with
three years of probation, community service and a fine.

Like many other discussions of the Worm, Ludwig writes the code
of it is schizophrenic: routines that don't get called, either by
error or in effort to throw others off. It presents "convoluted logic
that seems at best illogical."

Still, it was an amazing program in its effect on the Internet,
Ludwig continues.

And for the conspiracy-minded:

"Though Morris has confessed to writing it . . . there has been
lingering suspicion over the years that others were behind it, and
possibly the NSA. Such allegations are, of course, unproveable."

A detailed presentation of the Worm's code and function is delivered.
Ludwig adds a small bit of the original is missing: "I simply could not
find it anywhere."

"Computer Virus Supertechnology" is one of kind. Despite years of social
opprobrium, Mark Ludwig is still the only one doing these types of books
regularly.  The audience is entirely his.  Paradoxically, other
publishers offering books on computer viruses -- from the anti-virus
side of things -- now call him in attempts to cajole him
into selling their offerings through the American Eagle mail catalog!

Finally, like the rest of American Eagle's recent offerings, "CVS1996"
delivers a hefty amount of dense computer code and analysis requiring, at
the very least, a passing familiarity with the subject or the patience to
master a rather technical treatment in the taboo worlds of computer virus
writing and publishing. Plus, there's its unique list price.  These are
not minor obstacles to the dilettante computer vandal.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:  THE CORY RANT
=====================================

[This issue Crypt reprints a reader letter simply entitled "The
Cory Rant."  It is reminiscent in style of the old Mr. Badger
columns in Crypt Newsletter.  From 1992 until 1994 Badger regularly
cursed the dumb evil of computing atrocities perpetrated on Americans
until abruptly disappearing into a black hole somewhere in South Carolina.
We miss you, Mr. Badger.  Please come home.

However, in fond remembrance of Mr. Badger's Weltschmerz, behold a
credible substitute, "The Cory Rant."]


Dear Crypt:


I'm sure you've seen many, many jokes based on the ignorance of
computer novices.  For example, a customer calls PC technical support
to report a defective cup holder.  Actually, the cup holder is a
CD-ROM tray, cup holders not being usual acessories to computers.

This is true!

There are actually many computer buyers who think CD-ROM trays are cup
holders.  And to think that Clinton is worried about gun control.  Sheesh.

At amusement parks you can find stylized representations of furry
woodland creatures with their hands outstretched, advising patrons they
"must be this tall to ride this ride." But you never see any intelligence
or physical requirements on the computer boxes, do you?

A big contributor to the problem is the retail arena. This is where
most folks buy their first PC. The manufacturers, you see, have taken all
the money away from the engineers and given it to the people in marketing.

An example:  Compaq computers used to carry a three year on-site service
warranty.  Well, because computers represent such a tiny profit margin
(largely because corporate retail re-buyers are generally ignorant of
computer-type affairs and wouldn't realize they were being bent over
until long after being screwed by the vendor was just a distant memory),
the retailers are in love with the concept of extended warranty plans.
That's because they represent almost a 100 percent profit margin.
According to a Compaq rep, Compaq -- among others -- shortened their
warranty period to one year with only 90 days on-site service in
order to grease the chute for easy sales of extended warranties. Extended
warranties tack on anywhere from $40 to $300 to the price of a computer
system.

After all, you're probably not going to be using that same
damn-hard-to-upgrade Compaq computer five years from now, so what's the
point in adding a two year warranty onto a machine that's already covered
for three?

Acer is about to unveil a new "home PC" which, among other useless features,
will be "silent" and feature a REMOTE CONTROL, for God's sake.   The goal
here is to make the PC fit in amongst the TVs, VCRs, microwaves
[you know, the combination mind controller/organ cookers], karaoke
machines, toasters and other consumer electronics claptrap.

Now, I ask you, when was the last time you said to yourself: "This PC is
just too damn loud! I can barely hear the ballgame over the noise of that
power supply fan. That reminds me, I need to defrag the hard drive but
I'm way too fuckin' lazy to walk eleven feet to the keyboard and click
the proper icon.  I sure wish this thing had a remote control!"

The PC manufacturers these days are perpetually attempting to fill needs
that have never existed in the past, do not exist in the present, and are
not likely to exist in the future.  Compaq already has a line of
Presario PCs which have an ugly little slidebar-type display
(evidently not driven by software; it looks like it's in the hardware)
that pops up on the screen to show the volume and play status of the CD
in the CDROM drive.  This has no useful function that I can see, other than
to make it look just like the primitive activity displays you see on your
TV and VCR.

What purpose does this serve after the closing of the sale? NONE!

It may be that humans, or at least middle-class Americans, have devolved
to the point where there is no solution to this.  However, I'd be
interested to see what would happen if the instruction and "help" files
were sold separately.  Most of the time, problems arise because people
won't Read The Friggin' Manual and end up calling ME, yes ME, 59 times per
hour to ask how they can get Microsoft Word to print in landscape
orientation.  However, if people actually knew they were PAYING for the
documentation, that might prompt them to actually USE it, thin and useless
though it often is.

The Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit -- a book, actually -- is
three and a half inches thick and sells for about $45.  It contains answers.
The stuff in the box with Win95 contains only a bunch of vague
semi-technical platitudes carefully designed to combat the mysterious
phenomenon known as Buyer's Regret.

Buyer's Regret is what occurs when a sucker realizes how stupid he
was to buy the shit he didn't really need or want in the first place.

Damnit.  I need a new job.

This Saturday, I learned that Best Buy, Inc. now offers "virus
eradication" as a service in its store for the low-low price of $35.00
plus $15 per half-hour labor.  The mind reels. What if a customer comes
to them complaining of a virus when it turns out they actually have
some wretched video drivers causing crashes every three minutes?

Do they get charged the $35, anyway?

What happens if Best Buy employees are too monumentally stupid to
successfully eradicate the virus? Or what if there is no virus but
Best Buy reports there is and erases all the software on the machine
because they couldn't "disinfect" it?

The cruel side of me wishes he had enough expendable income to find
Little Loc and have him construct something tailor-made for Best Buy's
minimum-wage technicians.

It would almost be worth the horrendous amount of cash to watch.  After
all, anyone with enough audacity to charge $30 to install a
pair of memory chips or $60 to install a "multimedia kit"  -- the latter
translates to CD drive and sound card --  deserves the chance to actually
earn their money, no?

See ya,

STILL MORE RANT
===============

Crypt:

Relating to your comment in Crypt 38 about the book title, "Bombing
to Win" . . . You probably know this, but back in the 1960's
Dr. Jose Delgado wrote and published a book called "PHYSICAL CONTROL
OF THE MIND: TOWARD A PSYCHOCIVILIZED SOCIETY."  (If you have a copy
of this you are willing to sell, let me know.)  It is my understanding
that Delgado essentially proposed that remote-controlled brain implants
could and should be used to turn everyone into Stepford wives and children.
Delgado is the fellow who found that he could control a bull to some
degree with an implant called a stimoceiver that he designed and
installed himself.

At any rate, it's hard to beat that title as far as I'm concerned.

Cory Tucker

[Crypt replies: No, Crypt has never seen such a book.  However,
Jose Delgado lore is better served by The Steamshovel Press and
similar publications.  It's Crypt's impression that there is no
need for a "stimoceiver" in 1996 to Stepford-ize Americans. It's
done socially by the process known as "corporate rightsizing."
Organization men and women become so frightened of being made into
unemployable beggars they'll do anything for approval, even to the
eating of bugs during job performance reviews if this is deemed acceptable
behavior.

If Crypt were to look into Jose Delgado and "stimoceivers" it would
be a trip too deep into the realm of crackpots.  There would be no
end to it.  INSLAW and the OCTOPUS, Michael Riconuscioto, General
Ray Stubblebine and Psi-Tech.

Now you must excuse Crypt, Fletcher Prouty and E. Howard Hunt are
knocking on the door.  There's a HERF gun they wish to demonstrate.]


READER COMMENTS ON JOHN ALEXANDER
=================================

Hello Crypt:

A while ago, I saw your article and was quite surprised that you have a
"John Alexander Watch" type of group.  Well, the fact of the matter is that
John Alexander has settled in Las Vegas since early this year.  He is
at the National Institute of Discovery Sciences, 1515 E. Tropicana,
Suite 400, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119.

If you would like to know more about what's going on I would suggest
that you write to him directly.

I had a special occasion last March to visit him there.

I asked him about whether the institute was part of Bob Bigelow's
"Foundation," but he did not wish to answer that question.

My impression of him is that he is a courteous gentleman, although the
way he writes is very curt and seems "lifeless." But maybe that's his
style.

The reason I was interested in him was because of my activity with the
monitoring of the so-called Deep Black Projects programs.

Anyway, just wanted to give my two cents of comments.

Sincerely,

Norio

CRYPT ON COMPUSERVE

Crypt Newsletter is now concentrated in two places on Compuserve.
GO CRYPTNEWS brings the user to dedicated Crypt Newsletter message
and file bases!  For example, in addition to the usual issues Crypt
maintains copies of electronic documents like the Federation of
American Scientists' Secrecy & Government Bulletin and the recent GAO
report on hacking incidents at Department of Defense.

GO NCSAFORUM will bring users into the National Computer Security
Association Infosec forum.  This forum features a great deal of specific
and general information on computer security as well as Crypt Newsletter
in its attached file libraries and message bases.

What?  You've been reading Crypt Newsletter regularly and you
haven't purchased a copy of "The Virus Creation Labs"??  

Well, what are you waiting for?  A gold-plated personal invitation?

What people are saying about THE VIRUS CREATION LABS:

     "Crypt Newsletter editor George C. Smith's entire book exposes an 
     insane world where everybody claws at each others' throats -- and 
     where even the virus writers have marketing departments. 172 pages 
     written with an utterly cynical sense of humor . . . This book gets 
     my highest recommendation. Required reading for anybody
     who claims the sky is falling in the computer world." 
                      
                      ---Rob Rosenberger, Computer Virus Myths,
                         October 1996

     "I couldn't stop reading it . . . As hype continues to
     build about security on the Internet and movies like
     _Hackers_ ooze the real hackers into the mainstream arena,
     this book is definite apropos material for the time.
     Read it! A+"
                      ---The Net magazine, February 1996


     "[VIRUS CREATION LABS] is informative and stunningly
     incisive . . . "
                      ---Secure Computing, October 1995

     "George Smith . . . takes a look at the world of virus writers
     and anti-virus software vendors in a style similar to that
     of 'Cyberpunks' -- anecdotal, humorous and revealing . . . a
     lucid and entertaining read."

                      ---Computer Security Journal


     "There are relatively few books on the 'computer underground' that
     provide richly descriptive commentary and analysis of personalities
     and culture that simultaneously grab the reader with entertaining
     prose. Among the classics are Cliff Stoll's 'The Cuckoo's Egg,'
     Katie Hafner and John Markoff's 'Cyberpunk,' and Bruce
     Sterling's 'The Hacker Crackdown.'  Add George Smith's
     'The Virus Creation Labs' to the list . . . 'Virus Creation
     Labs' is about viruses as M*A*S*H is about war!"

                       ---Jim Thomas, Computer underground
                       Digest 7.18, March 5, 1995

     "THE VIRUS CREATION LABS dives into the hoopla of the Michelangelo
     media blitz and moves on to become an engaging, articulate,
     wildly angry diatribe on the world of computer virus writers . . .
     Expert reporting."
                      ---McClatchy NewsWire
