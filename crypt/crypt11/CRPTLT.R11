         ************************************************************
 
         Reuters News Service reports that two U.S. senators, Democrats 
         John Glenn and David Pryor, have urged George Bush to prevent 
         destruction of White House computer records during the transition 
         to the Bill Clinton administration. 
  
         In a letter to the lame-duck, the senators claimed that sensitive
         data faces "a significant risk of destruction." 
         
         The astute reader is encouraged to read between the lines 
         and jump to the conclusion that the Democrats are concerned 
         about the mutilation of electronic files generated by the 
         National Security Council during Iran-Contra.
         
         In any case, worried Democrats are advised to be on the lookout
         for unexplained junkets to Colombia and vieled references to the
         "Ghost of la Catedral" during the waning days of the Bush
         presidency.

        CONSECRATED PSYCHOBABBLE: EDWIN CLETON's CODE EXECUTION SIMULATOR,
        OR: HOW -*NOT*- TO WRITE A SOFTWARE MANUAL!
        *****************************************************************

        Last issue's readers may remember a passing infoblip concerning
        the naming of one Edwin Cleton as the Fidonet Virus echo moderator.
        In related news, a dedicated reader dug a Cleton/Saesoft shareware
        anti-virus program known as the Code Execution Simulator (CES)
        out of the trash and passed it on to the Crypt Newsletter.
        From what we could tell, it was "supposed" to be a $40 cash money
        heuristic scanner. In any case, CES refused to function at the Crypt
        editorial offices in any logical manner. (Could be someone's
        pulling our leg! Hah!) And the accompanying 
        documentation was, well . . . you can read it for yourself:


        -=[ravings starts here]=-
        CES (Tm) Code Execution Simulator.                 
        =*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*==
        "Gather enough information and the solution will be obvious."
                                                               S.B. 1988

        "A virus can  NOT be detected  BEFORE execution, it can  only be
         detected  AFTER or  WHILE execution, which is  at the moment to
         late, however, to detect anything  for that matter, you need to
         execute it first before there will be *anything* to detect."
                                                               E.C. 1990

               "Mate(s) it simply makes sense, make a backup..."

        The stages of development;
        =*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*===*==
        The object is  to create  rules related behaviour, consistent to
        such an instruction  or event of instructions in order to deter-
        mine if *something* is happening, the order  of what this *some-
        thing* is, is yet to be defined by the sub-rules who are (to be)
        generated out of the strain that started the initial behaviour.

        Consistent rule related  behaviour  is *never*  predefined, thus
        the object  or statement 'will never  work well enough' is irre-
        levant to it's  initial base, whether or not *a* rule 'works' is
        of no concern to the  CES model, for the intention  is to create
        such *working* rules related to any behaviour it will derive, if
        not, the initial rule is dropped and this has yet to happen.

        To create such rules, there base  must be optained at the lowest
        level and  gradualy go upwards to become  *ideal*, each rule and
        the sub-rules related must be dedicated to one single predefined
        *instuction* or event of such instructions.
        
        The lowest level  based rule  *must* effect it's sub-rules or if
        and when needed, create such, a sub-rule will and can eventually
        link with other sub-rules, somewhat like a  neural network, once
        each level expands  and thus also there related strains into the
        *rule network*, some point  must be given  to hold it at a given
        time, backtracking each  level will  then (and only then) result
        in *a* logical deducting 'intelligent' rule based CES system.


                                     Page 2

        The CES model  is not a  debugger, if  *a* program  executes, it
        will do the same inside CES's environment, undocumented instruc-
        tions are of no concern, as they  *are* documented somewhere and
        can be  included along  the line they  appear, if not, CES  will
        simply halt requesting manual instructions, which in turn can be
        solved on the same line they appear.

        The *model* should provide in it's own complexity to amphase the
        creation  of  direct logic  solutions  to any  given problem, or
        abort complexity.

        Scanning for prototype of code is a waste of time, recording and
        detecting  behaviour  isn't, yet you have  to define normal  and
        abnormal behaviour.
        -=[ravings end here]=-
        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Hah??? "Amphase"? How about "aphasic"! Don't be frightened readers!
        Yes, indeed, you are right! It IS impenetrable crap!

        CAIRO RESEARCH'S AVLAB 1.0: A PRODUCT WALKTHROUGH
        *****************************************************************
        
        Tired of lunatic contributors to Virus-L and the Fido Virus
        echos sniping at your carefully reasoned analyses like junkyard 
        dogs tearing at pieces of rotten, greasy meat? Then, Cairo 
        Research's AVLab 1.0 is just the thing for you - a program designed 
        to buttress your arguments over the efficacy of anti-virus scanners 
        with the cold, unforgiving steel of statistics. 
        
        In its broadest function, AVLab works like a shell, automating
        scan testing of virus-laden directories and tabulating the
        results. Throw 300 virus samples into a test directory, add
        a scanner of interest (Cairo has already supplied 5 slots
        for the more common products: SCAN, TBScan, F-PROT, etc.)
        and use the drop down menus on the interface to begin testing.

        AVLab manufactures a result, like so:

        Little could be more straightforward. Of course, you're left
        to ponder the meaning of it yourself; factors like
        how random were the choices from your virus library, how 
        reliable the results taken from a scan of less than 2,000
        MtE samples, how out-of-date the scanner (Leprechaun 3.76 is 
        over a year old. Not a bad score, wouldn't you say?) - all
        must be considered. AVlab will get you into the ballpark,
        though, and keep you waist deep in e-mail from the matrix 
        as long as you let it.

        The only hard part about using AVLab is initially programming
        the command line switches to software not already included in
        the pre-configured slots. And that's trifling.

        AVlab will also read those VIRSCAN.DAT files that come with
        a few European a-v scanners, presenting them in a 
        scrollable database far prettier than the straight original
        text. You can add your own note to each virus in the 
        database, too. Strangely, this was where the only bug in my
        version cropped up. I added a note to one specimen and it
        bled through to every virus listing in the database.

        The program is well-mannered, its documentation brief and to
        the point. AVLab's an unique example of a "niche"
        product: Perhaps just the thing to help you persuade a 
        potential client that you're ready to go into the anti-virus 
        scanner certification business. For a fee, of course. ;-)

        It's $30 cash money as registered shareware from Cairo;
        the same folks produce a virus-info BBS door and a few
        direct-action research viruses featuring interesting encrypted 
        messages like "Rock o' the Marne, sir!"

        MORE HACKER CRACKDOWN: THOSE WHO DON'T REMEMBER THE PAST
        TEND TO REPEAT IT
        ***************************************************************

        In a December news piece from the Associated Press, Kevin Poulsen, 
        a former Silicon Valley computer worker, was reported as
        charged with stealing Air Force secrets that allegedly included a
        targeting list - a computer tape containing an order for a
        military exercise code-named Cabre Dragon 88. 
  
        The 27-year-old Los Angeles resident was named in a 14-count 
        indictment that includes a charge of gathering defense information. 
        The punishment associated with conviction calls for 7 to 10 years 
        in prison. 
  
        An unnamed colleague faces lesser charges of unlawful use of 
        telephone access devices, illegal wiretapping and conspiracy. 
  
        Poulsen's lawyer, Paul Meltzer, claims the data secured by his
        client was not sensitive and that it was reclassified by government
        officials to secure an easy prosecution. 

                                     Page 4


        Poulsen's prior history, according to AP, included 1989 charges 
        for stealing telephone access codes from a Pacific Bell office, 
        accessing Pacific Bell computers, gathering of unpublished phone
        numbers for the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco; trade of
        stolen telephone access codes and eavesdropping. He was free until
        April 1991, when a tip generated by a TV show led to his
        arrest. Poulson has not yet been tried for these charges;
        a court date is set for March. 

        Without knowimg much more about the particulars of this news
        piece or Poulsen, it is still worth going over the alleged theft 
        of a military targeting list in slightly greater detail.  Consider 
        the value of any stolen strategic or tactical (Presumably nuclear:
        when the Air Force uses the euphemism "targeting list" it is
        almost always in the context of nuclear war-fighting.)
        targeting list with these points in mind:

             1. The U.S. is not at war and faces no obvious enemy.

             2. Familiarity with any number of publications
             on Air Force tactical and strategic planning leads one
             to realize that any targeting list generated by 
             military planners tends to contain several hundred
             to thousands of points. Armed with that knowledge,
             any citizen equipped with a good tourist map 
             could generate his own plan which would be expected to
             have considerable overlap with any military list.
             What "secret" value do any of these lists have?

        It is tempting to think of Poulsen's stolen list as
        another probable "E911 BellSouth"-type document. Worth about
        $20, if anyone would be interested in it.

        REVIEWING VICTOR CHARLIE 5.0 FROM BANGKOK SECURITY ASSOCIATES: 
        NOW, REPEAT AFTER ME, "OWATTA GOO SIAM!"
        ***************************************************************

        "The World's First Generic Anti-virus Program!" claim Bangkok
        Security Associates of Victor Charlie 5.0. While it would
        never get past the desk of an American adman, it made us
        smile. 
        
        Sure, it's a dumb boast. But so what! The PC world is full of
        'em.  
        
        In any case, Victor Charlie works on the premise that all the
        serious viruses of the future will be memory resident.  Fair
        enough.  

        So it offers its body up as bait to a resident virus, using itself
        and two "sentry" executables as targets of infection. When infected,
        Victor Charlie attempts to go on the attack. It grabs a signature
        from one of its infected files, adds it to a generic scanner/
        integrity checker, prompts the user to scan the disk and delete
        files found to be infected or changed, regenerates itself and then 
        forces a cold reboot.
        

                                     Page 5

        It's not a bad approach. Victor Charlie 5.0 detected, disarmed
        and deleted a raft of resident viruses and files infected by them. 
        Jerusalem variants, Npox variants, the Hitler virus (in this issue), 
        ARCV's Scroll - all fell quickly to VC 5.0. Sandwich, a marginal 
        stealth virus - as were Scroll, Hitler and NPox - was also quickly 
        disposed of. Viruses using advanced encryption were slightly more 
        successful. The polymorphs Pogue Mahone and and Coffeeshop 2 were 
        detected in memory and purged by reboot. Predictably, VC could not 
        generate usable signatures from them. The program's back-up, a 
        VERY SLOW integrity checker, detected files changed by the 
        polymorphs and flagged them. By reading the documentation a more 
        doltish user could, in theory, figure out the proper course of 
        action.

        Victor Charlie's other major feature was its "protection" of
        user-selected programs. Essentially, this translates as: let
        the program make a back-up of your favorites, stash them
        somewhere else on the disk under different names and restore
        them when changes are detected in the originals. Not exactly 
        novel, but at least guaranteed an almost 100(null)uccess rate
        when usable.

        It provides similar protection for the hard file's system 
        area and a utility seemingly analogous to MS-DOS's FDISK /MBR
        option.

        The program's Lao-Tse (I couldn't resist this awful pun!) points: 
        
        1.  Victor Charlie cedes the playing
        field to direct action viruses. It relies on it's integrity
        checker and self-generated audit of infection trails to
        eliminate them. In light of the speed of the program, this 
        is a tedious, frustrating process all out of proportion to
        the actual threat. 
        
        2.  VC 5.0 won't detect companion (spawning) viruses.
        
        3.  The program would not generate a "rescue disk" as advertised.
        It flat-out refused to work for us. 
        
        4.  And the installation/initialization procedure hinged on  
        extended batchfiles which had to be poked and prodded in ways
        not obvious to the average PC user.  (I.E., only fanatics
        and programmers - people who don't need this program - would 
        get it to function in real world situations.)

        Bangkok Security Associates asks for $50 in registry. We don't
        think this is a good buy . . . unless you crave a challenge. 
        In fact, its ridiculously priced considering the competition. 
        The Crypt recommendations to Bangkok Security Associates (remember,
        advice is often worth exactly what you pay for it): knock $15 off 
        the fee, make the install program work, lay off the Thai sticks 
        when composing the documentation and see us in 6 months, dudes.

        FILE LEECHING MADE EASY: A HALLOWED TRADITION SERVED BY THE
        PUBLIC DOMAIN TECHNOLOGY OF LEECH-ZMODEM
        ______________________________________________________________

        Until now, you may have been at the mercy of your local "warez
        dood" - beholden to his every whim for the file points YOU

                                     Page 6

        NEEDED like life's blood itself for your obsessive-compulsive
        piracy habit. But now, you can strike back with a tool previously
        used only by the very "elyte"! In the grass-roots tradition of
        individual empowerment, Crypt Newsletter supplies YOU with
        the Leech-Zmodem, a tool designed to optimize your neo-psychotic 
        problem, at the same time creating bookkeeping headaches for 
        pirate BBS's everywhere!

        LZMCNF.SCR and LZM.SCR will recreate the Leech-Zmodem programs
        for you. And, with the help of the pre-made batchfiles, QMOD.BAT
        and PCOMM.BAT (see additional documentation in endnotes), we give 
        you the complete drop-in package of Leech-Zmodem for those using 
        the popular ProComm Plus and Qmodem Pro telecommunications software.  
        Place these files in your telecommunications directory, disable the 
        auto-Zmodem download option if it's turned on, and you're ready 
        to leech by calling the program from your ProComm or Qmodem menu!

        Configuring Leech-Zmodem couldn't be simpler. Go to your
        DOS prompt in the Leech-Zmodem directory.  Type: LZMCNF.
        The configuration program will come up and you will answer a
        few simple questions as to color preference, bps rate and
        COM port address.  When asked about method for "cancellation,"
        choose "s" for single-file download. Now you are ready 
        to go, go, go!

        How does Leech-Zmodem work? Dial your local "warez board,"
        preferably one where you already have an account but, perhaps,
        not the file points you think you so richly deserve.

        Select a "ware." Pick one that will use up almost
        all your precious file points! Go ahead! Instruct the "warez
        board" to send it. Activate your Leech-Zmodem (here you should
        have ALREADY de-activated your auto-Zmodem download). The
        colorful Leech-Zmodem menu should appear on your monitor, 
        showing you the progress of your transaction. Now watch closely!
        The file is almost finished. What's that? Leech-Zmodem is
        springing into action, squaring the file away while sending a
        bogus error code which instructs the host software that the
        transfer was "aborted."  Now, check your file points. They
        are untouched! The host software takes nothing away for "aborted"
        transfers. But you have the file, anyway! Victory is sweet!
        Logoff at once and find another BBS to try it on, now that you've
        got the hang of Leech-Zmodem!

        We are sure you see the potential of Leech-Zmodem! Use it knowing
        that we've tested it successfully on a number of popular softwares
        including Telegard, Vision-X, Celerity, PCBoard and WWIV, among 
        others. And after reviewing the documentation of these BBS
        packages, we can tell you with some assurance that the authors of
        these programs remain uncognizant of the special challenge posed by
        Leech-Zmodem.

        However, a few caveats:

        1. Don't be a chump and throw away your winning hand by attempting
        to download 20 files in one session. Even the densest sysop's 
        will be alarmed when they review their daily log and see that
        long audit trail with that curious string of "aborted transfer"
        notations.  Spread your attention to many. Use Leech-Zmodem
        strategically, interspersing parasitic behavior with the 
        occasional "regular" session.  
        

                                     Page 7

        2. Try to avoid using Leech-Zmodem when you've got a hunch that
        the sysop is staring directly at his monitor. While some sysops
        will never grasp what is going on in "real-time," it's unwise
        to walk in harm's way.

        3. If you are confronted by a sysop who has caught on to what
        you are doing, try buying him off by offering him his own copy
        of Leech-Zmodem! Often, this tactic will work.

        4. Leech-Zmodem works fine on public domain, pornography
        and virus exchange BBS's, too. It excels on any system dedicated 
        to a "file-server" mentality.

        5. If you have your own BBS, you can protect yourself from Leech-
        Zmodem by using the -S (for SlugBait) command-line switch when
        calling your Omen Technology DSZ Zmodem program. SlugBait was
        designed by Chuck Forsberg to trap programs like Leech-
        Zmodem by putting a notation in the transfer log that the session
        is "questionable" when aborted with the pattern common to Leech-
        Zmodem.  If your registered version of the program supports this
        feature, DSZ will tell you when something is rotten in Denmark.

        6. Leech-Zmodem is a one-way program. It will only handle
        Zmodem file transfers from the sending BBS to you.
        
        The history of Leech-Zmodem is spare. The program appeared
        on various underground BBS's about a year ago, so it's
        not particularly new. However, it works and is likely to
        remain effective for some time. Even now, we know of BBS'er's
        who use Leech-Zmodem on an almost daily basis. So, you can thank
        Leech-Zmodem's anonymous author for this "interesting" and
        valuable addition to your hard file.

        Dateline: A passing comment carried on the winds of the WWIVnet
        from alert reader, Mr. Badger:

        Whî : Mr. Badger 
        WhÇ§: Monday, December 21, 1992   2:09 PM
        ürïm: Dream World BBS [ASV] (South Carolina) 

        FYI, there's a little article in the January 1993 Popular 
        Science on "Stalking Stealth Viruses".  Pretty basic, but one 
        quote should win a Sigmund Freud Anal Retentive Award from the 
        Crypt Newsletter:  

        "Viruses threaten to rattle the underlying confidence people 
        now have in computers...And if people stop relying on computers, 
        that's everybody's problem."

                          -Peter Tippett, president, Certus International
        
        Sheesh, quotes like that need to be on recruiting posters for 
        future hackers.

        -----------------------------------------------------------------
        Whoah! That got our attention so we rushed out to the nearest 
        newstand for our own copy of January's Popular Science. Sure 
        enough, an article on "stealth viruses" accompanied by a truly 

                                     Page 8

        freaked-out piece of artwork and the subhead: "Forget all the 
        hype over Michelangelo.  1993 may be the year that a new breed of 
        less visible but more sophisticated viruses begin to slip into 
        thousands or even millions of PCs."

        But you already know the punchline to this story, because you
        swallowed it in March. It's a hook to catch the general reader -
        nowhere does Popular Science deliver any support for the claim. 
        
        And the stealth viruses trotted out? Whale, 4096, Joshi, 
        NoInt (I suppose), DIR-2, Cascade (a stealth virus?); all well 
        characterized programs, all controlled by even the most inept 
        anti-virus software.  Of course, reporter Christopher O'Malley 
        never really gets around to hipping the reader to this fact. 
        
        The "Mutating [sic] Engine" is on hand, too. Even Mrs. Urnst Kouch, 
        an avowed computer-phobe was startled.

        "Mutating Engine?" she asked. "That's not right, izzit?"

        To be fair, O'Malley's piece is an earnest, if fumbled, stab at 
        good science reporting for a general readership. It's the kind of
        technical news we USED to be able to expect occasionally from our 
        better national newspapers rather than the current stream of 
        rah-rah "journal article of the week" swill. And we realize, too, 
        that the level of technical understanding in the average reader of a 
        newstand magazine dictates that he may consider any computer 
        virus close kin to a demon.
        
        But even that rationalization pales as an excuse for "dumbed-down"
        work when the reader finally gets around to examining Popular
        Science's version of a demo virus, BFV (for "batch file virus").

        "INFECTED BATCH FILES WILL INFECT OTHER BATCH FILES WHEN RUN!"
        warns the magazine ominously.  "If an infected batch file were 
        to be passed from one user to another, the new user's batch files
        would become virus carriers as well," reporter O'Malley writes.

        We were sure this was unadulterated crap, in light of the rest of
        the article and, indeed, BFV.BAT was a flop.  

        Its "virus" batch file code, in essence was:

                 FOR %F in (*.BAT) do copy %F + BFV.BAT    .

        Executing this code as the batchfile, BFV.BAT, in a directory 
        full of .BAT files merely mutilates all of them, appending 
        the above line to every one. Executing any of the "infected" files 
        at once locks the machine into an endless, rather obvious, loop 
        as the "infected" .BAT file recursively appends the line in BFV.BAT 
        to itself and its companions. (This is due to the way that DOS 
        processes the FOR command and the "variables" %F in the set, 
        *.BAT. Don't worry about the jargon. Try the experiment and see 
        for yourself.)

        Further, removing any of the "infected" files to a different
        directory off the machine's path (or a different machine, as 
        suggested) results in . . . nothing.  None of these files can
        do anything by themselves - hardly virus-like.  This 
        leads to the next question: Did the reporter even test his 
        own "batchfile virus"? Apparently not is the logical answer.  
        The science writer, leery of his own batchfile "virus." Well,

                                     Page 9

        isn't that just special?

        [In any case, the Crypt Newsletter editors have whipped up a
        quick .BATfile "virus" of their own, POPSCI.BAT. In actuality, 
        it is a "launcher" for a specially-commissioned-for-this-issue
        "Popoolar Science" virus. Popoolar Science, unlike BFV.BAT, does
        work. It will mutilate your .BAT files, your executables and
        your data in its search for files to infect. And it will spread
        from infected programs to other uninfected files, just like any
        normal virus. You can search for it with a real anti-virus
        program and, in general, watch it do things a number of
        viruses in the wild can do. (See end notes for further details.)]

        As you might guess, "Gates" is about Chairman Bill, Bill - the
        brightest man I've ever met, genius Bill, Bill - the master
        convincer, Billion-Dollar Bill, Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious
        Bill. In other words, it's a 500-page blowjob. 
        
        Manes and Andrews insist that Gates exerted no editorial control
        over their work. After reading "Gates," this is an unbelievable 
        claim. There's one paragraph devoted to Chairman Bill's legendary 
        crummy personal hygiene. Bill can't do more than one thing at a
        time while washing his hair, say Manes and Andrews, so he doesn't 
        shampoo too often. It's flabbergasting trivia like this that
        sinks "Gates." In spite of  "access" - there's no feeling that 
        these two clowns know anything more about Microsoft's boss than you 
        or me. DESPITE pages and pages worth of Bill coding BASIC, 
        Bill having a screaming fit, Bill buying a Porsche, Bill having 
        a cat fit, Bill getting ticked at Borland's Philippe Kahn, Bill 
        having an apoplectic fit, Bill flying to Armonk, NY; Bill having 
        a shit fit, Bill going to ComDex, Bill making his first million, 
        Bill having a yelling fit, Bill making his first billion 
        (gaaaaaaah!), "Gates" is a dull-to-the-point-of-mind-roasting read 
        filled to the gunwales with sickeningly cutesy, purple prose.
        
        If you wanna know about Gates, save $20 and get Robert X. Cringely's
        "Accidental Empires" (Addison-Wesely). Pass on this dreck.

        The NECRO (SKULL) virus is included as another example of
        what can be done with the Virus Creation Laboratory and Phalcon/
        SKISM Mass Production Coder. Suprisingly, the most recent version
        of SCAN does not flag files infected by NECRO - revealing that
        either McAfee is slipping or there is more to either code set
        than the mainstream "authorities" would have you believe. We
        think the latter explanation is closer to the truth. You will 
        also enjoy the novel manner in which NECRO toggles between being 
        a .COMfile appending virus and an .EXE-overwriter: a good example 
        of being creative and imaginative within the constraints of 
        a simple model.
        

                                     Page 10

        Since NECRO is a run-time infector, it is rather easily
        detected by any functional file integrity monitor. To eradicate it,
        delete all files altered by either form of the virus.

        The HITLER virus is a product of Demoralized Youth, apparently
        a Scandinavia-based group.  It is a large-ish memory resident
        .COM infector which is marginally "stealthy," that is the
        virus subtracts its file size from infected files when the
        PC user employs the "dir" command.  You can execute it safely
        with this in mind: .COMfiles are infected upon load, the
        command processor can be successfully infected, and file size
        changes are invisible when the virus is present in memory.
        If the user has the presence of mind to record his machine's free
        memory before the virus is called, a simple MEM /C command will
        reveal the presence of the program - HITLER creates a quite
        noticeable 5k drop in available memory.

        HITLER contains no destructive payloads per se. It does, however,
        install its own routine which runs off the machine timer 
        tick interrupt.
        
        When conditions are right, a vocal effect - some goon shouting
        "Hitler!" - is sent to the PC internal speaker card.
        It is quite repetive and annoying. On some machines, all that
        is heard is speaker buzz.  (See the HITLER virus source
        listing for more notes.)

        Interestingly, an highly placed source informs the newsletter
        that the HITLER virus will probably not be called 
        that as it finds its way into many anti-virus programs.  
        Presumably, it will be renamed to avoid offending those with
        thin skins in Europe, thus keeping it in line with new virus
        nomenclature rules designed to avoid offensive titles.  
        (Remember the stink generated about
        CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN.) Aaah, the sociology of computer
        virology never ceases to fascinate.

        POPOOLAR SCIENCE is a primitive overwriting virus.
        It is supplied only in the batchfile, POPSCI.BAT., and its A86
        source listing. Experienced Crypt Newsletter readers uncaring of
        the A86 assembler can strip the DEBUG script from POPSCI.BAT
        with any minimally functional text editor and create a separate
        DEBUG script for the virus. POPOOLAR SCIENCE restricts itself
        to its current directory (unless on the path and called from a
        different one), displays an endorsement of Popular Science
        magazine everytime it is executed and overwrites all files
        in the current directory instantly, ruining them if they
        are data and making them copies of POPOOLAR SCIENCE if
        programs.  This renders it a nuisance on the same order as the 
        much smaller DEFINE and MINISCULE series of viruses. However, 
        while easily tracked, POPOOLAR SCIENCE can make a shambles of 
        a system quickly and explosively, if stupidly handled. Executing 
        the batchfile POPSCI.BAT will cancel the monitor, assemble and 
        launch POPOOLAR SCIENCE virus in the current directory. All files
        will be infected in the current directory as soon as the 
        message "Popoolar Science Roolz!" is displayed on the screen
        and the user is returned to his command prompt. The virus
        does not check if the file is a program or data; it does not
        check if the program has already been infected.  We feel
        none of these features are needed in a kamikaze demo program
        of this nature. [Additionally, the MS-DOS program DEBUG.EXE
        must be present on the path or in its default location for

                                     Page 11

        POPSCI.BAT to work.]

        LITTLE MESS is a bird of a different feather.
        Produced by the Dutch virus-writing group, TridenT, LITTLE
        MESS has a specific target: the TELIX telecommunications
        program. Written in SALT, TELIX's scripting language,
        LITTLE MESS is a spawning virus attracted to compiled
        applications scripts in the TELIX directory (of which there
        are always two-three laying about). LITTLE MESS renames any 
        of these compiled files with an .SLX extension and then makes a
        duplicate of itself renamed as the script it is replacing.
        When the infected script is used, LITTLE MESS quickly does 
        its thing and then calls the .SLX script to complete its
        task. When all the compiled TELIX scripts are infected,
        further use during a TELIX session will cause LITTLE MESS
        to flash a "Legalize Marijuana! -TridenT" message
        on the screen, boxed out in the usual TELIX message form every
        one in eight executions.
        
        Of course, LITTLE MESS cannot spread outside of the TELIX
        program or find its way onto another machine unless friends
        exchange compiled scripts.
        
        LITTLE MESS is unnoticeable in TELIX sessions; the .SLX files
        easy to overlook. Some integrity checkers can be set to 
        find LITTLE MESS,  but we think this very unlikely in general
        practice. LITTLE MESS is an extreme, yet intriguing example of
        a "niche" virus. LITTLE MESS is removed from TELIX directories 
        by deleting all .SLC files which have an .SLX counterpart. The
        .SLX files are then renamed with .SLC extensions.
        
        LITTLE MESS cannot execute outside the TELIX environment. As
        a compiled "script," it can only operate within the TELIX
        "Go" command.
        
        The TridenT group has also produced the Coffeeshop 
        (Trivia: "Coffeeshop" is a place one goes to purchase 
        dope when in the Netherlands. I wonder if these guys have 
        any David Peel records?) series of viruses, the advanced 
        encryption device called the Trident Polymorphic Engine used in 
        the Coffeeshop 2 and 3 viruses, and a number of other things.

        The QMOD.BAT and PCOMM.BAT files are "drop-ins" for those
        wishing to use in Leech-Zmodem with the popular Qmodem or
        ProComm Plus telecommunications softwares. QMOD presumes
        a download directory named DL off a QMODEM home directory,
        but this is easily edited to a user's taste. The key
        command after calling the Leech-Zmodem program is "c=s",
        which sets "file cancellation" to single mode. Most
        every other variable can be set by the Leech-Zmodem
        configuration program, LZMCNF.EXE.  Quite naturally, once
        the Leech-Zmodem files have been copied into your
        telecommunications directory you will activate the program 
        through the "external protocols" menu.
        
        For example, PCOMM.BAT would be installed by going into 
        ProComm Plus's SETUP (keyboard ALT+S), and highlighting 
        PROTOCOL OPTIONS.  After entering that menu, the sub-menu 
        EXTERNAL PROTOCOLS would be chosen.  Leech-ZMODEM can be set up 
        in either one of the 3 external protocol slots. In the first slot, 
        setup should look like:

        Virus exchange sysop Aristotle, informal head of the Vx
        echomail network, informs the Crypt Newsletter that he
        is putting his collection of over 2000 viruses up for sale
        to interested buyers.  Inquiring parties will have the
        option of downloading the Aristotle collection from 
        The Virus/Black Axis BBS at high speed. Aristotle tells
        us he has consulted widely with a number of law enforcement
        agencies on various aspects of the Vx network, conspiracy
        and the trade of dangerous code and has decided to charge
        for access to his code library.

       
        The independent comic book publishing house, Dark Horse, will
        produce a 4-book series called "Virus."  "Virus" tells the
        story of an alien computer virus which commandeers a Japanese
        warship and begins conducting experiments on its crew. More
        on this when we get copies.

        The Youngsters Against McAfee Instant Virus Producer is a
        virus-making tool modelled after the PS-MPC and VCL.
        The IVP, as it is called, generates TASM-compatible
        source code for as yet unscanned direct action .COM and
        .EXE-infecting viruses. Each virus listing generated is 
        peppered with a number of randomly-generated "no op" codes.

        Virus Creation Laboratory variant if the garbling "nops"
        are removed.

        A look back at March 1992 and the Michelangelo scare:
        an extract from Pulitzer-winning humorist Dave Barry's annual
        year end wrap-up (distributed by Knight-Ridder Newspapers).

        MARCH
          1 -- Pat Buchanan wins the Austrian primary.
          2 -- Saddam Hussein appears on "Larry King Live."
          3 -- Business and academic professionals around the world are
          gripped by panic following dire warnings from numerous experts
          that tens of thousands of computers could be infected with the
          dread Michelangelo virus, set to strike on March 6.
          4 -- A grim President Bush places U.S. armed forces on Full Red
          Alert in preparation for expected onslaught of the dread
          Michelangelo virus.
          5 -- Highways leading from major metropolitan are hopelessly
          jammed by millions of fear-crazed motorists fleeing from the
          oncoming Michelangelo virus.
          6 -- As predicted, the dread Michelangelo virus erupts, 
          wreaking untold havoc on an estimated one computer belonging to
          Rose Deegle, of Rochester, N.Y., whose Christmas card list
          is nearly wiped out.  Vice President Quayle jets in to oversee
          the relief effort.
          8 -- Michelangelo appears on "Larry King Live."

        ROLL THE END NOTES!

        Thanks and a tip o' the hat go to alert Crypt Newsletter
        readers Primal Fury, Captain AeroSmith, Beach and Mr. Badger 
        for their timely contributions to this issue.

        Software included with the Crypt Newsletter falls under
        the catch-all term dangerous code. In the hands of
        incompetents and experienced PC users, many of
        the programs can and will foul the software resources of 
        of a computer, most times irretrievably.  Much of the
        code supplied is designed solely for this purpose.

        Why then, the newsletter? There are many reasons, but one
        which sheds a little light on the matter is illustrated
        by this brief bit of e-mail from the FidoNet.


       " ..but, could you provide me with info on how I can get
         copies of existing viruses for research purposes?"

        As a new user you will not know that there is a rule here
        completely forbidding the trade in virus samples. I expect you
        will already have had a hostile message about baseball bats
        from kindly Mr Cleton.
     
        However, I think I am within my rights to explain. There
        is an unwritten convention here that dictates that to be come
        an accepted, respectable virus researcher you must first go to
        a Virus Exchange bulletin board or other underground outlet
        and obtain as many live virus samples as you can. Then you
        can say you already have an extensive virus library and folks
        on here will take you seriously and swap viruses with you. No

        one will ever admit this but it was the only way I could
        break into the field....

        To assemble the software included in this issue of the newsletter,
        copy the MS-DOS program DEBUG.EXE to your current directory,
        unzip the newsletter archive into the same directory and
        type MAKE at the DOS prompt.  The included batch file will
        recreate all the software with the exception of the POPOOLAR
        SCIENCE virus. DO NOT EXECUTE -=POPSCI.BAT=- IN THE SAME
        DIRECTORY AS THE REST OF YOUR NEWSLETTER FILES OR THEY STAND
        A GOOD CHANCE OF ALL BEING INSTANTLY RUINED. Move POPSCI.BAT to 
        a separate directory and read the documentation before you
        begin to play with it. The A86 source listings to the
        three viruses are also included for the more experienced
        readers. If that seems like jargon to you, don't lose any 
        sleep over the .A86 files.

        This issue of the newsletter should contain the following
        files:

                CRPTLT.R11 - this document
                PCOMM.BAT - ProComm external protocol batch file for
                Leech-Zmodem
                QMOD.BAT - Qmodem external protocol batch file for
                Leech-Zmodem
                LZMCNF.SCR - Leech-Zmodem CONFIG program scriptfile.
                LZM.SCR - Leech-Zmodem main executable scriptfile.
                LTLMESS.SLC - compile form of LITTLE MESS virus
                LTLMESS.SLT - SALT language source of LITTLE MESS virus.
                POPSCI.BAT - POPOOLAR SCIENCE batch file virus launcher.
                POPSCI.A86 - POPOOLAR SCIENCE virus A86 source listing.
                HITLER.A86 - HITLER virus A86 source listing.
                HITLER.SCR - HITLER virus scriptfile.
                NECRO.A86 - NECRO (SKULL) virus A86 source listing.
                NECRO.SCR - NECRO (SKULL) virus scriptfile.
                MAKE.BAT - instant "maker" for this issue's software.
                Ensure that the MS-DOS program DEBUG.EXE is in the 
                machine path or current directory, before 
                typing "MAKE".
