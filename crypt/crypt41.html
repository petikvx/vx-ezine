PILED HIGHER AND DEEPER:  THE JOHN SEABROOK BOOK TOUR

To set the right stage for the following bit of news on author and New
Yorker reporter John Seabrook, it's necessary for Crypt News to steal
outright from Eric Alterman's description of the pundit Morton Kondracke
in "Sound & Fury," an analysis of the Beltway political punditocracy.
Alterman likened Kondracke disparagingly to Ayn Rand's Lancelot Clokey,
a social critic in "The Fountainhead" whose literary celebrity was purely
the creation of the people he worked for.

Like Morton Kondracke, John Seabrook is another Lancelot Clokey --
cyberspace's. In the past, he's been memorable for overwrought features
in New Yorker magazine on swapping e-mail with Bill Gates and being
flamed by David Sternlight. The latter incident apparently so unnerved
Seabrook, he momentarily believed he'd been attacked by a computer
virus.

Like Lancelot Clokey, John Seabrook is an author --  "Deeper: My Two-Year
Odyssey in Cyberspace" (Simon & Schuster). In the months to come you can
expect Seabrook's book, like Clokey's "The Gallant Gallstone," to be
praised to the heavens by critics who assuredly know better.  Soon
thousands and thousands of copies of "Deeper" will sell and the name
"Seabrook" will be on the lips of all the wired kingdom's digerati.  Like
Clokey, Seabrook will believe his reviews, lose all perspective (actually,
he's already in this phase if the following interview is an indicator),
and live the life of the brilliant social critic and public philosopher
when in reality he's done "nothing more outstanding than sleeping, eating
and chatting with neighbors."

On the p.r. junket for "Deeper," Seabrook came to CompuServe this week
and talked on-line for about an hour in front of an audience of
five -- six or seven if you count his mother plus the handler from People
magazine, the outlet sponsoring the conference. It didn't matter that
there weren't many real questions, Seabrook had answers: cliches as quips,
contradictory statements, whizz-bang "hey-even-I-coulda-thought-of-that"
pronouncements and some clowning.

Here then, a sampling of Seabrook quote from the interview --

To no one in particular:

"Pop culture is a weird thing."

On why the Net is sometimes "nasty:"

"There is a nasty side to lots of people, but some people do a
better job of keeping it civilized -- which is good. On-line lowers
the curtain of civilization. But sometimes it's good to be nasty.
It gets the nastiness out that would otherwise be used in the real
world."

On the ["mountain men and pioneers"] of the Internet:

"They [the mountain men] are going to have to figure out how to get
along.  The frontier is over. Now it's the next phase. It's more like
the town than the frontier now.  The mountain men are probably feeling
a little blue."

On journalism and reporting from the Internet:

"If I had to do my reporting work on the Net, I'd be fucked. [But not
_too fucked_ for the New Yorker gig and book tour. -- Crypt News] I never
use the Net for information gathering -- it's lousy for that. The public
library in NYC is much better."

On Bill Gates and how the jig's up for the master of Microsoft:

"It's amazing Gates caught onto the Net at all. He is about one man alone
with his machine, not connectivity. He's faking it now -- I don't think
he's [going to] survive for long."

And then, contradicting himself in the same breath, how Gates will
conquer Netscape:

". . . as to Netscape, I think it will end up like Apple. Microsoft has
already successfully copied Netscape, just as it did Apple. It will
slowly market it out of business."

The next one is quite original.  Wouldn't you want to read a book by
an author who had this to say about America On-Line in early 1997:

"AOL sucks!"

Again on Bill Gates, the one-time subject of a lengthy Seabrook/New Yorker
treatise:

"I don't exchange e-mail with him. I don't have that much to say to him,
I guess. If I really wanted to talk to him, I'd e-mail him, but I doubt
he'd e-mail me back. Fuck him."

On the Internet, again, this time parroting the People magazine handler
who asked if the Internet was a "giant time sink:"

"The Net is a giant time sink."

On what he's writing about now:

"Now I am writing a story about a young would-be rock star."

And on writing about the Net, again:

"Actually I don't think I'll be writing about computers or the Net
again for awhile, maybe never. I feel like I said everything I
have to say . . . or what I haven't, I'll say on the book tour
gigs."

Near the end, Seabrook's handler asked how his book could do well in
a time when Net books are classed as "failed" because they're Net books
(Nope, I'm not making this up.) The answer, of course, was Seabrook's
Net book is _different_ because it's not really a Net book:

["Deeper"] is sort of different though.  It's not really about the Net,
it's about one man's experience of the Net. It's more of a memoir of Net
use than a book about the Net."


THE DOG THAT WOULDN'T HUNT:  MORE ON-LINE AUTHOR/BOOK PROMOTION

Author Jon Katz may be the Big Kahuna of WIRED magazine, but on
CompuServe this week, attendance at a conference to promote his
new book, "Virtuous Reality: How America Surrendered Discussion of
Moral Values to Opportunists, Nitwits, and Blockheads like William
Bennett," was a gold-plated bummer, drawing three people, not
counting the promotion's handler from PEOPLE magazine.

That's three -- not three hundred, not three thousand, not even
thirty. Not a baker's dozen. Three.  And it was three less than
the number who attended John Seabrook's promotional, also hosted by
PEOPLE, the week before.  (However, Katz didn't bring his mother, like
Seabrook.)

If you get out your cyber-pencil and consider CompuServe's membership
to be approximately 3.2 million, the audiences for these heavily
peddled on-line conferences was an infinitesimally small
.000009 percent of the base that was the target of the on-line
advertising.  And it demonstrates the futile nature of mainstream
media efforts in cyberspace by the likes of such as PEOPLE magazine.
Despite daily advertising, the push from PEOPLE On-line and lots of
the usual rah-rah from cyberspatial shills, these dogs
won't hunt. The irony of mainstream media being such a certified
non-starter in cyberspace cannot be lost upon an author as quick
as Katz.

Paradoxically, Katz's conference was quite interesting -- much more
pointed and thoughtful than Seabrook's.

On the endless handwringing about on-line pornography, Katz said:

"Concerns about sexual imagery and children are not hysterical and
should not be dismissed. I don't dismiss them.

"I just feel the need to point out that the Internet has no history
of harming children. About 30 young people have been harmed as the
result of online encounters in the history of the Internet, making it
one of the safest media ever. Pornography is an 8 billion dollar
industry in America that has always existed and will always exist . . .
I argue that we keep it in perspective and teach our children how to
deal with it in a rational way."

Katz also skewered the TV, newspapers and magazines repeatedly,
maintaining they are increasingly isolated and as a result,
meaningless to the public.

"I think passive media . . . will be relevant and accessible only
when they begin conversations with their readers in the way Web
writers do as a matter of routine.

This is common, Katz said, where "media is passive -- by which I
mean media like newspapers, local and national telecasts, that provide
no integral means for consumers to reach journalists, challenge
them, correct them, or otherwise communicate with them."

Later, sounding a lot like U.S. News & World Report's journo-bashing
editor James Fallows, Katz invoked Thom Paine as a personal hero.

"Paine was courageous and intelligent and saw journalism as a powerful
medium of change . . . His spirit is very much alive on the Net, but
sadly he would be unemployable in any newspaper in America. He would
hate objectivity, would be appalled at the corporatization of journalism,
and would find his heirs timid and fearful, and dependent on a culture of
experts and spokespeople.

At one point Katz was asked if he could offer any examples of mainstream
politicians who genuinely understood the "pop culture/technology" thing.

"No," he said.


LIQUOR IN THE FRONT, POKER IN THE REAR OF THE FLYING SAUCER: JIM
SCHNABEL'S 'REMOTE VIEWERS' IS A CAPTIVATING READ ON GOVERNMENT
PSYCHICS, CULTISTS AND MISCELLANEOUS WEIRDOS

[Another part in an infrequent Crypt Newsletter series.]

      "Ph'nglui mglw'nath Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
      [Translation: In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits
      dreaming.]"
                          -- H. P. Lovecraft, "The Call of Cthulhu"


H. P. Lovecraft created the Cthulhu Mythos, a loose collection
of stories built around a pantheon of horrible otherworldly beings
banished from our dimension in eons past but still plotting plots of
conspiracy and overthrow.  The lore surrounding government psychic
research, non-lethal weapons and, now, the catch-all term "information
warfare" is our contemporary Cthulhu mythos. In it, horrible, otherworldly
citizens banished from the realm of credible thought publicize
themselves or other unnameable forces plotting plots of conspiracy
and overthrow.

Jim Schnabel's "Remote Viewers: The Secret History of America's
Psychic Spies" (Dell) is a fast, amusing and quite thorough read
about a number of very interesting flakes and kooks who formerly
worked for the U.S. military on "remote viewing" -- a euphemism
for carrying out government intelligence and reconnaissance work
while in a psychic trance.



       "Of Herbert West, who was my friend in college and in
       after life, I can speak only with extreme terror."

                          --Lovecraft, "Herbert West -- Reanimator"


"Remote Viewing" is remarkable for its collection of whacked-out
quotes and feats attributed to military men.  The guru of non-lethal
weapons, John Alexander, holds forth -- mentally bending forks and
spoons galore for generals in the U.S. Army.  This pass-time
became so popular according to Schnabel, that a general in charge of
U.S. Army Intelligence, Albert Stubblebine -- a patron of Alexander's
-- was given the nickname "Spoonbender."  General Spoonbender is
custom-made for myth-making: He sent soldiers for psychic sessions and
trance workshops at a resort in the Blue Ridge mountains. He hired yet
another soldier, Lyn Buchanan, for psychic warfare because the man
steadfastly maintained he had crashed his base's computer network
simply by telepathically commanding it.

Eventually, Spoonbender, Alexander and Buchanan were banished from
the military by superiors at the Pentagon and intelligence agencies,
just like Hastur, Great Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth -- Lovecraft's Elder
Gods -- were banished from Earth after a long, titanic battle with
even greater powers.  However, the legacy of Spoonbender, Alexander
and Buchanan -- as well as others -- lives on, dreaming in its
own dead house of R'lyeh, that indeterminate place on the Internet
were the paranormal and conspiracy thinking hold sway.  And if the
entertainment industry's increasing interest in this material is
any barometer, even the lowliest of our discredited psychic warriors
won't be dreaming in R'lyeh much longer. Invoked by the powerful
interest of tabloid-reading, X-File enjoying Americans -- the demand is
such that their Great Cthulhu, in some way or another, must always
be released from his temple.


       "Where can I go that I don't sense movement behind the scenes?"

                          --Ramsey Campbell, "The Franklyn Paragraphs"


Yep, a whole ball of insane wax is present in "Remote Viewers:" UFO's
emerge from icy mountain fastnesses in Alaska, unspeakable machines
lurk concealed beneath the Martian dust of Cydonia, a woman reads tarot
cards for the Defense Intelligence Agency, strange apparitions haunt
the corridors of intelligence agencies, and Soviet psychics who could
slay with a thought (although their aim wasn't too good) are alleged to
conduct fiendish experiments. Schnabel reels it all out with a wink and
an omnipresent dry sense of humor.

Finally, aided by an ultimate psychic warrior named Ed Dames, Schnabel
does his own "remote viewing" and succeeds in -- lo! -- scaring his
girlfriend. You certainly don't want to miss "Remote Viewing" if you're
at all curious about how the U.S. military finds novel ways to waste
a portion of the fifteen cents out of every dollar it receives from
your yearly tithe.

Notes:

1.  Please do not write Crypt Newsletter with the information that
the Great Cthulhu, John Alexander, has been seen with financier
Bob Bigelow at the National Institute for Discovery Science.  Alert
readers have already furnished this data.


WAZZU! GESUNDHEIT!

On January 14, a military source forwarded a hysterical warning issued
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff computer office in coordination with
the Defense Information Systems Agency.  Sent to ALL U.S. military
offices around the world, the JCS alert claimed the Wazzu macro virus
-- in particular, a variant of it named Meatgrinder -- could
"destroy hard drives, or at a minimum, data on hard drives . . .
Be advised,  many virus detection packages do not detect or eradicate
[Wazzu]."

The warning was remarkable only for its paranoia and misconceptions --
the Wazzu virus can't destroy hardware and Meatgrinder was detectable,
just about the opposite of JCS/DISA claims. The alert was also
immediately posted anonymously to several Usenet news groups.  [This
raises another interesting question.  If the Department of Defense is
genuinely knowledgeable about alleged threats posed by foreign agents
and hackers trying to make off with its secrets, how does it categorize
simultaneous posting of internal computer security memos to Usenet news
groups by its own warriors?]

In any case, the Wazzu alert was immediately dismissed as idiotic
nonsense issued by anonymous nincompoops within the bureaucracy way
too quick on the trigger but very successful at embarrassing themselves
and others who certainly knew better.

Nevertheless, Wazzu virus variants do exist.

Crypt Newsletter did a cursory search of the Web for military publications
and sites that have wrestled with them and came up with one interesting
example from remote McMurdo Station, Antarctica.

Writing in the November 24 issue of the Antarctica Sun Times, a publication
edited by an arm of the U.S. Naval Support Force at McMurdo, Jacqueline
Kiel documents Wazzu infection at the base.

A Wazzu infection ran wild, according to Jim Johnson, assistant manager
in the base's information systems department, when the virus arrived
in an infected telephone list document generated by Word.

"Anybody who received that document and called it up [in Word] was
infected," Johnson said.

Johnson alluded to Wazzu's payload, the contamination of other documents
with instances of the nonsense word "wazzu." "I lost two man-weeks so far
this season just dealing with virus corruption," he said.

Other virus infections which have plagued McMurdo have been caused by
the system-area viruses Ripper, Monkey, and variants of Form.





INTERNATIONAL INFO-WARRIORZ FIND BYPASSING SILLY U.S. EXPORT
CONTROLS A SNAP

It should come as no big surprise that foreign companies interested in
obtaining encryption software find that bypassing U.S. export controls
aimed at impeding its distribution a trivial challenge.

In fact, it appears to happen quite a bit since many foreign
developers are continually interested in seeing what U.S. rivals
are developing for the American market alone.

What follows is a submission from an Indian software developer and
it mentions a number of ways in which foreign firms are bypassing
export controls, which -- in this case -- appear to be unenforceable,
anyway.

"To start with, I made a TELNET connection to <domestic Internet Service
Provider> and using its text browser -- lynx, I connected to the MIT
page for download using the link from www.pgp.com. When . . . asked
the queries for citizenship etc., I answered 'Yes' to all. MIT's server
then allowed me to download the software without any problem. But, this
download was in the USA on the <domestic Internet Service Provider's>
disk and hence -- technically -- it was not a [foreign] export from MIT."

The encryption software is then downloaded overseas, if the party is
so interested.  No rocket science or, uh, export licenses needed.

"We have found a few other . . . ways to defeat the MIT access control as
well." Further, "These involve the POBOX.COM service as well as the
Anonymizer site.  Also, we have found that many foreign companies have
sites in the United States used expressly for this purpose.

"They . . . telnet into the site . . . and access any MIT-type 'protected'
sites with ease.

"This type of access is not preventable using the technique that MIT is
[employing] for validation.  It [appears] that they are validating the
IP address of the user when they are on the site.  We have found that
having a US CompuServe account and accessing it [through] a [satellite]
connection, we can spoof the MIT site into thinking that the IP is from
the US.  In  India, we use a satellite [link] to connect to CompuServe
which, for some reason, helps us evade the protection export controls
on sites that employ the MIT security model."


IN HEARING OF THE ELECTRONIC BOGEYMAN: A CONTINUING SERIES


electronic bogeyman: a hacker, instrument of a hacker or anonymous
source portrayed in the mainstream media as a menace to society.
The electronic bogeyman must always be quoted making grandiose,
unverifiable, or nutty claims (e.g., opening all the automatic
garage doors in Anaheim, California at precisely 2:00 pm) about feats,
usually malicious, that can be performed with a computer.

Usage:  Reuters interviewed an _electronic bogeyman_ from Croatia who
claimed he had invaded an installation where atomic secrets were kept.
In a later press release the e-bogeyman downgraded this claim to
Anderson Air Force Base on the island of Guam.


                               -------


In this week's episode of _electronic bogeyman_, the popular Web soap
opera in which international and American news agencies print the
press releases of teenagers who claim to have infiltrated and
subverted the Pentagon or some other important and very secret place,
we travel to Croatia, where a fifteen year-old hacker made his country
so proud, officials there were inspired to hold a press conference so
that people in the United States would notice.

During the episode, wire news reports about the Croatian electronic
bogeyman changed so much from day to day (first a hacker had broken into
an "atomic installation," then the hacker said he had downloaded files,
later he said he had not, etc.), they reeked strongly of phlogiston.
The waffling nature of the story speaks strongly for itself and
large elements of it are reprinted verbatim from the original news
releases.

February 20th --

". . . Laura Lui of the Reuter News Service says the [Croatian]
local press is reporting [that] three high school students, surfing the
Internet on their home computer, broke into several U.S. military
installations' databases, including those of the Anderson nuclear
installation and an unnamed satellite research center."

"Lui [said] that following a report in the Zagreb daily Vecernji
List, local reporters flocked to the high school in the Adriatic
port of Zadar where the . . . teen-age hackers . . . specialize in
mathematics and information technology."

"One of the teenagers, identified . . . as [Vice Miskovic], told the
state news agency HINA he accessed the Pentagon database while surfing
the Net [in January].

"[Vice Miskovic] told [Reuters], 'The data are compressed and need to be
extracted, so I don't really know everything they contained, but it
sure was very interesting.'"

" . . . assistant Interior Minister Zeljko Sacic told state radio that
invaders broke into the U.S. Defence [sic] Department computer system of
the airbase on Guam island . . . "


February 21 --

"A report this week that high school computer users in Croatia
had broken Pentagon protection codes and copied highly classified files
from U.S. military bases has been flatly denied by the U.S. Defense
Department . . ."

"Zagreb press is reporting [hackers], surfing the Internet on their
home computer, broke into several U.S. military installations' databases,
including those of the Anderson nuclear installation . . . [the hackers]
broke codes . . ."

"'They did not,' Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters in
Washington. 'They did apparently get into some computers at Anderson Air
Force Base in Guam.'"


March 3 --

"[Vice Miskovic], a Croatian teen-ager, says he modified programs he
found on the Internet and used them, 'with a bit of luck,' to hack his
way into a U.S. military computer at the Anderson Air Force Base in
Guam."

"'It was a challenge,' says 15-year-old Vice Miskovic of Zadar. 'I was
curious to see whether I could do it or not.'"

"Miskovic told Associated Press writer Snjezana Vukic he searched
through the Anderson base files during the month of January, but whenever
he wanted to download files, they started to disappear."

Crypt News translation: Vice Miskovic first claimed he downloaded secret
files to get the attention of international wire news reporters like
Laura Lui. But when he couldn't produce them weeks later, Miskovic
confessed he hadn't actually downloaded any files at all and further
confused the issue through clever use of a techno-magic,
dog-ate-my-homework alibi.

The remainder of the March 3 news release on Vice Miskovic is full of
standard, if unfortunate, electronic bogeyman cliches: The electronic
bogeyman didn't destroy anything, the electronic bogeyman's computer was
seized by government authorities, the electronic bogeyman's grandmother
loved her grandson whom -- she said -- preferred computers to dating
girls.

". . . Nediljka Miskovic said her shy grandson (other reports named her
as his mom) -- known in the computing underground as 'Intruder' -- has 
always been fascinated by computers. 'He had no interest in new jeans, 
sneakers or girls.'"

The casual Net surfer is invited by Crypt Newsletter to use the
popular Dejanews Usenet search engine to search for evidence of the
dangerous electronic bogeyman, Vice Miskovic.

A search keyed to his name returns a mind-rotting number of hits,
most of them connected to a get-rich-quick by mail scam (known as Make
Money Fast). Some of Miskovic's Make Money Fast posts were later
canceled by users from the net-abuse newsgroups. Miskovic's name was
also attached to a phoney hacker mailing list.

Someone claiming to be a "Vice Miskovic" posted Make Money Fast
repeatedly to the Usenet in January with an address in Zadar, Croatia, 
attached.  At the end of one of the Make Money Fast posts, "Miskovic" 
pleaded:

"INCLUDE me ! Ey it is so expensive to connect to NET here in 
CROATIA! I am spending all MY money on this INTERNET CALL!         
Can U help by sending money 4 me! I'll repay U when i EARN money!

Crypt News tip:  Hey, international teen hackers!  Interested in
maximizing your worldwide publicity?  Stop wasting time
harassing the locals in chat rooms on America On-Line! Instead,
buckle down and ensure your place in news wire immortality by sending
those electronic press releases to your local Reuters or Associated Press
bureau, preferably to a reporter or desk editor _not_ fluent with
computers but hungry for a scoop. Be aware that if you are too 
convincing in the world press your equipment may be seized.



Late breaking news:

March 6 -- Yikes! Reuters reports still more electronic bogeymen  - this 
time defacing a NASA Webpage in Greenbelt, Maryland. The latest atrocity, 
only three days after the wire's last dispatch on Vice Miskovic!

" . . . the Reuter News Service says a group calling itself H4G13 left 
a message online claiming responsibility."

"During the next month, we the members of H4G13 will be launching an 
attack on corporate America. All who profit from the misuse of the 
Internet will fall victim to our upcoming reign of digital terrorism,"
wrote the electronic bogeymen, rather balefully.

SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INFO-WARRIOR SHOOTS OFF HIS MOUTH

Some newspapers exploded with stories in January dealing with the
release of a new Dept. of Defense treatise, "Report of the Defense
Science Board Task Force on Information Warfare Defense." Forgotten
it already? Don't worry, here's the summary:

On January 6, the Wall Street Journal excerpted fragments of the
DSB report including the oft-repeated statement that the Pentagon and
the entire rest of the country are vulnerable to an "electronic Pearl
Harbor" if acts aren't polished in the arena of Internet security.

Journal reporter Tom Ricks termed the report unusually "strident."
It was an accurate description.  The Defense Science Board report
on IWAR-D, as it is called, reads like a Cold War policy document
written by Paul Nitze.

It is nothing less than a call to arms for the military to start
a crash effort in the field.

Ricks apparently interviewed Duane Andrews, one of the report's
authors, and elicited the comment that Andrews -- a former
undersecretary for defense during the Bush administration -- would
like to see legislation enacted that would free the Pentagon to attack
hackers with polymorphic computer viruses.

Andrews would, he said, like to see a capability that seeded hacker
or attacker computers with "a polymorphic virus that wipes out the
system, takes it down for weeks."

There was no obvious comment on how this capability might be approached,
aside from wishful thinking. For those unfamiliar with the ins-and-outs
of computer virus technology, Andrews request was a side-splitter, akin
to asking scientists to work seriously on a method in which sand might
be converted into gasoline. [One computer virus expert, unnecessary to
name here, once suggested that actively pursuing a strategy of trying to
foster virus infections on the computers of alleged national enemies
would be about as sensible as "dumping bags of pepper into the
jetstream."]

Interestingly, the virus quote by Andrews does not appear in the
original of the Defense Science Board report. However, the study does
address it in elliptical terms.  Repeated reference is made to using
"active" measures in "Information Warfare -- Defense."  What the
authors are saying is that they're recommending the Dept. of Defense
be able to conduct counterattacks against hackers or nation states
discovered to be launching information warfare assaults against the
U.S.  The report asks that legislation be enacted or rewritten to
allow for this. A Freedom of Information Act request to the Defense
Science Board returned no further information on the topic.

Andrews is currently executive vice president of corporate development
at Science Applications, a bona fide Beltway Bandit and secretive
mega-contractor to the intelligence community. The company boasts extensive
facilities in Tyson's Corner and Ft. Meade. The Defense Science Board report
recommends a $580 million dollar investment in research and development
to the private sector for hardware and software to implement computer
security.  Science Applications, of course, stands to benefit greatly
from any large spurt of growth in DoD expenditures due to the collision
of Cold War-style paranoia and the subject of information warfare.

Curiosities in the DSB report: (1) It elevates the DEFCON series of
hacker get-togethers to that of strategic menace conducted on US soil;
(2) The supersecret MILSTAR satellite system -- a system that responsible
elements in the country have been trying to have killed for years -- 
is invoked as a possible key asset in the coming time of information
war.

In addition, the report recommends an escalating series of conditions
be set by DoD to describe information warfare, similar to the DEFCON
grades.  However, no concrete information is developed on how, exactly,
the government would determine if the U.S. is undergoing an information
war attack. And this remains one of the stickiest of problems for
information warriors:  How in Sam Hill can one distinguish an
information warfare attack from the work of 100 Jolt-cola crazed college
students fiddling around on a few networks, hoaxes, stupid practical jokes 
or the usual problems that beset computing networks?  It's a double-edged 
sword, however. There is no reassurance or guarantee that any foreign 
country willing to waste time developing info-warriors to hack the nation 
for military aims would even be able to rise above the noise of everyday 
network mishaps. Perhaps it is even a valid strategy to try to encourage
potential adversaries to invest in information warfare if the effort
is likely to be unnoticeable. Better that than trying to steal weapons-grade 
plutonium. Crypt News challenges its readers to ask their favorite 
info-warriors these questions and not settle for jargon-caked bull or 
vague policy statements in reply.

It is also of note that the authors of the DSB report are primarily
drawn from aerospace, not computer security. John Pike of the Federation
of American Scientists succinctly characterized them as "heavy metal"
and, indeed, the names are:  For example, in addition to Andrews -- author
Edward Aldridge is a former director of the spy-satellite flying National
Reconnaissance Office, Donald Latham is VP at LORAL, Bernard
Randolph is NSA and TRW Space & Electronics Group.


THE INFO-WARRIORZ OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIVERSITY:  NOT SUCH
HOT ESSAYISTS

Good info-warriors are never at a loss for words.  In fact, one of the
strong suits of information warriors appears to be the burying of the
enemy with floods of vague military philosophy, impenetrable jargon,
cliches, scenarios and aphorisms gathered from popular books
attributed to Alvin Toffler, Tom Clancy and Sun Tzu.

The National Defense University, a think tank based in Washington, D.C.,
that advertises itself as a DoD support organization aimed at
ensuring "excellence in professional military education and research
in the essential elements of national security," recently published a
number of essays from the new breed of information warriors being bred
in places like Science Applications and various arms of the services.

Crypt News excerpts some material from them for the enjoyment of readers.

From "The Silicon Spear: An Assessment Of Information Based Warfare
(IBW) And U.S. National Security" by Charles B. Everett, Moss Dewindt
& Shane McDade."

"The First Battles in the Era of Information Based Warfare: The Seizure
of Fiery Reef and Mischief Island: July 1997.

"In retrospect, it was all quite foreseeable.    then, hindsight is
always 20/20. The events had been lost in the 'noise.' The Board of
Inquiry and the numerous congressional investigations had all come to
the same conclusion," writes Everett in a spell-binding Tom Clancy-esque
opener to "The Silicon Spear."  He tells of an info-war with China and
the reader eagerly awaits the denouement of the "congressional
investigation" and "conclusion."  Unfortunately, Everett never gets
around to it, so Crypt News can't reprint it for you.

Everett then back-tracks his science-fiction scenario and begins
setting the stage for the coming info-war with China.  However, no
"silicon spears" are in evidence, just nuclear missiles.

"The US military attach in New Delhi reported that [Chinese long range
aircraft had overflown Indian airspace on three occasions. Reports coming
out of one of the few news services remaining in Hong Kong noted that
the 2nd Artillery-the PRC's nuclear rocket force-had begun to disperse
firing battery's well south of Lop Nor, near the headwaters of the Mekong
River in terrain that might preclude the travel of US cruise missiles
through the rugged Himalayas."

Then Everett abruptly shifts gears and defines "information war."

"Information based-warfare is both offensive and defensive in
nature-ranging from measures that prohibit the enemy from exploring
information to corresponding measures to assure the integrity,
availability, and interoperability of friendly information assets."

No!  Crypt Newsletter did not steal this from the Joseph K Guide
to Tech Terminology!

Everett loves acronyms in "The Silicon Spear."  He mentions one
called "GAP" for Gray Area Phenomena. GAP applies to:

"Ethno-religious-nationalistic conflicts;

Weapons proliferation-both conventional and nuclear, biological and
chemical;

Conflict over scarce resources;

AIDS and other infectious diseases;

The globalization of Organized Crime;

Drug Trafficking;

Economic Warfare and conflict over technology;

Emigration; and, Famine."

I bet you didn't know that "AIDS and other infectious diseases"
and "famine" were part of information war in the age of silicon spears! 
You fool, you.

The Chinese, writes Everett, are the leaders in information warfare.

Everett also invokes "robotics, nonlethality, pyscho-technology,
cyberdefense, nanotechnology, 'brilliant' weapons systems, hyperflexible
organizations, and 'fire ant warfare,'" in his essay.  Apparently,
all of the disciples of Spoonbender and the Great Cthulhu have not yet
been banished from positions in which they dispense military advice.
(See "Liquor in the front, poker in the rear of the flyin' saucer" in 
_this issue_).

"Matthew G. Devout, Brian K. Houghton, and 'Nil A. Polaroid' of
Science Applications do significantly better than Everett in
"Information Terrorism: Can You Trust Your Toaster?"

They, too, devote much of their essay to a science fiction tale.
Unlike Everett's, this one has an end to it and involves Croatian
electronic bogeymen. (Presumably more effective than Vice Miskovic,
but about of the same talent in the p.r. department.)

It goes something like this:

The e-bogeymen obtain a weather forecast for their neck of the woods from
the CNN Webpage. (What?  The television doesn't work?) Stormy weather
is the prediction and the terrorists have a plan all worked out:  They
go to a NATO airfield during violent weather and use their computers to jam
the air traffic controller.  Two C-130's on approach subsequently
collide and crash. The e-bogeymen run off and immediately send
communiques taking credit for the feat -- just like Vice Miskovic -- 
to the international newsmedia.  They include a Webpage address
in Holland.  International news broadcasts publicize the Website.
U.S. military men sitting around twiddling their thumbs all
jump up in unison, turn on their PCs and surf to the Holland page.
The page contains a boobytrap that is downloaded to their computers.
The boobytrap goes off 24 hours later and the military suffers untold
damage to its networks.

This actually sounds almost plausible until one starts to stack up
the variables.  The weather has to be stormy. The airfield has
to remain open. The jamming has to work.  The planes have to collide.
The international news media must be paying attention and not fixating
on O.J or JonBenet Ramsey _and_ it has to publicize the Dutch Website
with its boobytrap instead of sending out reporters at the local bureaus
in Croatia to try and find the terrorists for interview.

Crypt News stopped suspending disbelief at this point.

In the essay of "Nil A. Polaroid" and his colleagues as well as the
writings of other information warriors, a common thread is the
axiom that the military must be called in to work more closely with
law enforcement in domestic issues.  Crypt Newsletter sees this only
as an extension of Cold Warrior paranoia.  Now that the one big enemy
is gone, the military needs new enemies. The best enemies are ones that
are both internal and external at once, always vaguely definable in 
faux Tom Clancy-ish scenarios but never characterized or described with 
any great precision.

The Science Applications authors also have their own acronym, this 
one copped from an older acronym.  Computer emergency response teams are 
known by the acronym CERT. Now, there must be DIRT, or a Digital Integrated 
Response Team. DIRT, or DIRTs, will be the same as CERT, except DIRT can 
attack an enemy.  DIRT will also get its marching orders from "[an] 
information terrorism counterpart to the White House 'Drug Czar.'"

There are other information essays at the National Defense University
Website (http://www.ndu.edu) but a better closer is this definition
lifted from yet another of the information warriors:

"Machines and Microbes - Although one thinks of Star Trek and other
science fiction when the subject of _nanny machines_ [emphasis added,
the author really means "nano-machines"] comes up, it is actually a
feasible plan."

A vision of many Fran Dreschers -- "nanny machines" -- running amok
on a distant battlefield hectoring the enemy into submission should
bring a smile to your face and frame the discussion appropriately.



CORPORATE PROPAGANDA, INC.

Rejoice, rejoice!  Symantec Corp. has declared the period between
Feb. 15 and March 15, "Virus Awareness Month" -- even though it's
not a month.

The driven marketing managers of the Cupertino, California, anti-virus
software publisher claim the promotion is designed to educate computer
users about new virus threats.  So said a typical Symantec press release
disguised as news a week or so ago. "Because of the tremendous growth
in communications via the Internet, computer virus threats are on the
rise. Symantec is committed to protecting our customers from viruses,
therefore we have established Virus Awareness Month," claimed Symantec
pitchman, Enrique Salem.

Inspired by Symantec's Virus Awareness (tm) and its pseudo-informational
marketing aimed at maximizing the appearance of the company's nam    the
news, Crypt Newsletter and Rob Rosenberger's Virus Myths are declaring the
month of March as Symantec Awareness Month.  Unlike Symantec marketers, we
know the 12 months of the year and are setting
aside March as a special time in which everyone is invited to educate
PC users about Symantec's merciless pummeling of Netizens with ad
campaigns passed off as consumer news.

As you know, anti-virus companies enjoy a considerable amount of
valuable free publicity.  They spend a lot on advertising but they'd
much rather get mentioned in a news story.  Every time a virus appears,
anti-virus firms compete to get quoted in print or are called upon
to frown on cue for the TV camera.

However, Symantec's own ringer press releases mailed to 1,400 media
outlets via the PR Newswire aren't quite good enough. Poor Symantec
doesn't like this because it means competition with every other
company willing to spend $500 for 400 words uploaded to PR Newswire.
Why, on a bad day, a reporter might be forced to pick and choose between
as many as half-a-dozen quasi-fraudulent press releases, all from
different companies!  Symantec could get lost in the noise!  Symantec
salesmen might not get a telephone call!

No, Symantec wants reporters to salivate on command for it, just
like Pavlov's dogs.

To that end, the company has made it even easier for reporters to get
their daily dose of propaganda.  On February 10th, the company issued a
press release for its future press releases under the headline: "Symantec
Announces the Opening of the Symantec Antivirus Research Centre (SARC)
News Bureau for the Media!" [Note the too hip European English spelling of
"Center."  It's not just a "Center," it's a "Centre"!]

Symantec's outlet will serve as an information center -- some would
say a Sales Information Centre -- for the media only . . . Editors and
producers will be able to sidestep pesky competitors and contact the
SARC _News Bureau_ [our emphasis added] via
a special toll-free 1-888 number to obtain information on topical
issues such as . . . easy anti-virus protection through Norton AntiVirus
products, of course.

"We will be able to spread the word," burbled Symantec product manager
Alex Haddox in the press release to cover all future press releases.

And spread _it_, Symantec certainly does. Without pause.

On February 14, Symantec marketroids _again_ spammed journalists,
editors and -- by proxy -- most of cyberspace via PR Newswire with a
software promotion, this one hung on a stunt pulled by the Chaos Computer
Club.

Instead of using company resources to research and publish a thoughtful
and perhaps even valuable analysis of the Chaos Computer Club's
dog-and-pony show using ActiveX controls to allegedly subvert the Quicken
checking and banking software package, Symantec merely used the
opportunity afforded by momentary bad news to hector users into buying
more of its new products. [No mention, either, that Intuit, Quicken's
holder, claimed that the CCC stunt wouldn't work on American copies and
installations of its software.)

". . . Norton Secret Stuff today announced that [two Symantec
software solutions] can protect users against malicious ActiveX or
Java applications such as the recently discovered ActiveX control
created by the Chaos Computer Club . . . Internet users need to protect
themselves with encryption products such as Norton Your Eyes Only.  At
a minimum, they should get started with a free trial of Norton Secret
Stuff," said Bob Pettit, the day's designated Symantec huckster.

PC Users are invited to recall that it was just at the end of last
year that Netizens voted Symantec a winner in the 1996 Virus Hysteria
Awards.  Yes, instead of dispelling misinformation and confusion about
computer viruses, Symantec was deemed guilty of the just the opposite
in 1996 with a March press release describing a new Norton Anti-Virus
feature: the ability to detect Java viruses. However, the press release
admitted "no current Java virus threats exist." This led some to
question how you could test this feature to see if it really worked.

Actually, none of this mattered since all that was really important
was getting the company's name into more publicity thinly disguised as
consumer news.

Additionally, computer users are invited to point out a 1996 study
(probably _not_ available through the in the "Symantec Antivirus
Research Centre (SARC) News Bureau for the Media!") published
by the trade publication, Secure Computing, that demonstrated Symantec's
Norton Anti-virus was a poor performer when it came to Word Macro
virus detection and removal.

The ensuing vendor fight over these lousy results became even more
embarrassing when competitor McAfee Associates started a war of the press
releases, employing the Business NewsWire to tar Symantec. In
September, McAfee Associates CEO Bill Larson thundered in a press
release delivered over that wire: "Symantec appears to have repeatedly
and blatantly [misled] software consumers about the capabilities of
Norton AntiVirus . . . Once again, Symantec has tried to fool customers
by deliberately exaggerating the capabilities of Norton AntiVirus.  We
call on Gordon Eubanks, Symantec's CEO, to come clean and own up to - and
correct - his company's false and misleading claims."

For the sake of continuing Symantec Awareness, users are also
invited to reflect on the following:

[1]. In 1988, Peter Norton declared in _Insight_ magazine that computer
viruses were an "urban myth." "It's like the story of alligators in
the sewers of New York," he said. "Everyone knows about them, but no
one's ever seen them." Today Peter Norton is still ridiculed for that
quote.

[2]. And in yet another press release, this one from August 1996, a
Symantec marketing agent declared PC users needed the Norton
Anti-virus "to fight [today's] more sophisticated polymorphic viruses."
As usual, the Symantec marketroid was full of air: Polymorphic computer
viruses were old news around 1992 when virus writers like the Dark
Avenger and Mark Washburn popularized them in computer security circles
with viruses that demonstrated the effect. But in _August 1996_ the
company asked users to believe they should protect themselves against
this "new" threat.

Of course, polymorphic viruses do exist. They have for quite awhile.
But lots of different anti-virus software flavors find and eliminate
them, or claim to -- not just Symantec.

[3]. Another thing you will never read from the "Symantec Antivirus
Research Centre (SARC) News Bureau for the Media!":

Programmers for the Norton Anti-virus have deserted the company regularly
since 1995. A recent loss was to competitor S&S International. Three
developers went to McAfee sometime in 1995. One went to Command Software,
another to IBM. When Symantec asked what it would take to keep the IBM
defector at the company, he replied, "Buy IBM."

[4]. In a hot-off-the-presses (February 20) anti-virus scanner test
conducted by computer virus researchers at the University of Hamburg in
Germany, (not the "Symantec Antivirus Research Centre News Bureau for the
Media!") Norton Anti-virus finished _behind_ the competition in a
convincingly consistent manner.

In the study's top rating, Norton Anti-virus finished _behind_
Solomon's Findvirus, Anti-virus Professional, Alwil's Avast, Sophos
Sweep, F-Prot, and McAfee Associates' Scan.

Against "in the wild" computer viruses, Norton Anti-virus finished
_behind_ Solomon's Findvirus, Anti-virus Professional, F-Prot and
McAfee Associates' Scan.

In detection against file-infecting viruses, Norton Anti-virus
finished _behind_ Solomon's Findvirus, Alwil's Avast, Sophos Sweep,
Thunderbyte Antivirus, IBM Antivirus, McAfee Associates' Scan,
F-Prot, Norman Data Defense's VC and an obscure Russian program called
Dr. Web.

In detection of boot-sector infecting viruses, Norton Anti-virus
_did not finish_, completely failing mention against better-rated
competition.

And, finally, in detection of Word macro viruses, the University
of Hamburg test showed Norton Anti-virus behind the same competition
mentioned previously.

And please remember, "'Symantec Awareness Month' ends on April Fool's
Day!"

THE NUTTY PROFESSORS: ON THE DANGERS OF RELYING ON 'EXPERTS'

[Regular readers of Crypt Newsletter recall last issue's on the
academicians who had pulled the FBI's Law Enforcement Bulletin
along for a ride down the slippery slope of hoaxes and Internet
jokes.  On closer examination, the story became even more bizarre
than originally reported.  Rather than confuse readers by
abruptly taking up the piece where Crypt 40 left off, it is
presented again -- but with a whole lot of difference.]


"One of the hackers, known as 'Brain Dead' said, "getting arrested
for hacking is the first significant step in my career goal
of becoming a highl   id security consultant.' [cite: _Datamation,
April 1, 1995_]"

                -- David L. Carter and Andra Katz, from
                "Trends and Experiences in Computer-Related Crime:
                 Findings From A National Study" --
                 A Paper Presented at the Annual Meeting of the
                 ACADEMY OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SCIENCES, Las Vegas,
                 Nevada,1996


What you're about to read is an interesting and, perhaps, an
unintentionally humorous tale of what can happen when
inexperience, lack of fact-checking and research interests in
Internet computer crime collide.

Most wanderers of the Internet are familiar with the running joke
concerning computer viruses with names of celebrities, politicians
or institutions.

The names and satirical content evoke a momentary smile
or groan. For example:

"Gingrich" randomly converts word processing files into
legalese often found in contracts. Victims can combat this virus
by typing their names at the bottom of infected files, thereby
signing them, as if signing a contract.

"Lecture" deliberately formats the hard drive, destroying all
data, then scolds the user for not catching it.

"Clinton" is designed to infect programs, but it eradicates
itself when it cannot decide which program to infect.

"SPA" examines programs on the hard disk to determine whether
they are properly licensed. If the virus detects illegally copied
software, it seizes the computer's modem, automatically dials
911, and asks for help.

Rather amusing -- or boring -- depending on how many times you've
seen different spins on them.  Except Crypt News can't take the
credit for making them up.  The honor goes to an April Fool's Day
issue of Datamation magazine. Normally, that would be the end of
the joke but David L. Carter and Andra J. Katz, two professors
interested in computer crime, bit down hard on the Datamation
article and cited it as a source of real world examples in papers
presented to the FBI and The Academy of Criminal Justice
Sciences.

But I'm getting ahead of the story.

All this came to Crypt News' attention when the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's Law Enforcement Bulletin, published monthly out of
the organization's training academy in Quantico, Virginia, apparently
thought they were real, too [Crypt News 40].

Writing in the December issue of the magazine, Carter and Katz,
respectively academicians at Michigan State University and Wichita State, 
cited them as real examples of "insidious" new computer viruses in the 
magazine's feature article entitled "Computer Crime: An Emerging 
Challenge for Law Enforcement."

The authors seemed to genuinely believe these computer viruses
were in circulation, even to the point of citing the "Clinton" joke
again in an paragraph attempting to explain the motivations of
virus-writing system saboteurs.

"Some employees could be motivated to infect a computer with a
virus simply for purposes of gamesmanship. In these cases, the
employees typically introduce a virus to play with the system
without intending to cause permanent damage, as in the case of
the 'Clinton' virus."

Put in perspective, this was similar to reading a scientific
paper on the behavior of elephants and suddenly running across a
section that straightforwardly quotes from some elephant jokes as
proof of what pachyderms really do when wandering the African
veldt.

Acutely embarrassed over the mistake, the editor of the Law
Enforcement Bulletin did not initially return repeated phone calls
from Crypt Newsletter.  Andra J. Katz, reached over Christmas, said
only that her co-author was responsible for the goofed-up material
in question. Her co-author, David L. Carter, in turn cited an
indeterminate "British scholarly magazine" as the original fool.
(This comes from an editorial written by Margie Wylie of CNET.)
Carter never returned a query from Crypt Newsletter.

Eventually, Crypt News was able to reach the Bulletin's editor, Kathy
Silesky, who placed the blame squarely on the authors of the
bulletin's computer crime piece. The "British scholarly magazine" was
invoked again as the escape clause.  Two anonymous "security experts"
had also "verified" the jokes were real viruses for Carter and Katz,
said Silesky.  [In reality, the jokes came from an April Fool's
Day issue of Datamation magazine -- but more about this later.]

In a later call, Silesky admitted everyone had been caught with
their pants down.  When told the originals of the jokes were
taken from an April Fool's story, there was a brief silence on
the end of the line, then a short laugh.

In any case, increasing interest since the Bulletin's mistake
was first published in Crypt Newsletter 40 resulted in a hasty
edit in which the references to the jokes-as-viruses were simply
yanked from the article published on the FBI's World Wide Web
site.

However, the rewrite remains imperfect, the content still in
a twist.  Reference to the "Clinton" virus remains in the feature's
section on "Virus introduction."  And the print run sent to 55,000
subscribers is beyond intervention.

Even more bizarre: Katz and Carter were informed their research
had been contaminated by joke virus tales almost a year before
publication of their essay in Law Enforcement Bulletin!

Gene Spafford, A Purdue University faculty member and extremely
well-known computer security expert, wrote to Crypt Newsletter after
seeing its initial series of articles on the FBI gaffe.

"Sometime in early 1996, Carter and Katz issued a press release on
their research into computer intrusions," Spafford relates.  "I
thought the research was interesting, and I contacted Katz via
e-mail for more info."

Spafford continues, writing that he was "sent . . . a longer press
release that contained the same erroneous statements about joke
computer viruses that were printed in the FBI newsletter.  I tried
to call Carter, and ended up talking to Katz.  I explained to her
that those were not real viruses but jokes.  I further explained
that they should correct that release immediately or else face
ridicule from those who understood viruses."

"I never heard from them again."

But wait! The truth gets stranger.

The joke viruses also appeared in a supposedly scholarly paper
presented by Carter and Katz at a meeting of the Academy of Criminal
Justice Sciences in Las Vegas, Nevada, sometime during 1996.  Crypt
News dug up an electronic copy of "Trends and Experiences in
Computer-Related Crime: Findings From A National Study" on the
Michigan State University Intranet.  The FBI's Law Enforcement
Bulletin piece appears to be a condensed version of this paper.
Located in a directory seemingly devoted to college course readings,
it still contains the full text of jokes reprinted by the FBI.

Carter and Katz' "Trends and Experiences in Computer Crime:
Findings From a National Study" cites a 1995 _April Fool's Day_ article
in Datamation magazine as the source for its information on the "SPA,"
"Clinton," and other computer viruses.

The April 1, 1995 issue of Datamation featured a column of
ridiculous and humorous stories that were clearly April Fool's jokes.
In addition to the virus jokes there is a news brief on the League
of Information Systems Professionals or LISP, a "group" working to
ensure that "Dilbert" is carried in all local newspapers. LISP is
also said to be working for "the reinstatement of the slide rule,
especially in belt-mounted leather cases . . ."

Also in the Datamation article cited by Carter and Katz in their
research paper, the reader finds himself bemused by the tale of
computer scientists and anthropologists at the "Moe Fein National
Laboratory in Nevermore, Calif." The scientists are testing the
"feasibility of monkeys writing computer applications . . . We
calculate that if each monkey randomly pounds its computer's keyboard
for six to eight hours a day, the entire group will create a word
processor . . . within three to four months," is one excerpt from
it.

"The research is being sponsored by a large New York bank that
hopes to cut its in-house development efforts by getting the monkeys
to work for peanuts," it concludes.

If this isn't sufficiently absurd, consider that Carter and
Katz cited Datamation's April Fool's stories _twice_ in their
national study on computer crime.  In addition to joke viruses,
Carter and Katz also write of a government dragnet in which
federal agents arrested a dangerously successful hacker
gang.

"The hackers reportedly broke into a NASA computer responsible for
controlling the Hubble telescope and are also known to have re-routed
telephone calls from the White House to Marcel Marceau University, a
miming institute," write Carter and Katz in "Trends and Experiences
in Computer-Related Crime." They even name one of the nefarious
hackers involved in this heinous crime: "Brain Dead." Except "Brain
Dead" didn't exist. He was a creation of a Datamation writer.

"In one episode, the hackers broke into a NASA computer responsible
for controlling the Hubble telescope, aimed the telescope at Earth
and then proceeded to spy on a nudist colony near Camden, Maine. In
another shocking case, the hackers rerouted telephone calls from
the White House to Marcel Marceau University, an institution for
mimes, based in Inabox, Montana," reports Datamation in the April
Fool's Day issue.

Not to worry, though. The Datamation spoof reports the hackers were
arrested by agent "Slim Steel" during "Operation _Moon_ Angel."

Marty Moore at Datamation magazine laughed on recollection of
the April 1, 1995 issue.  "You mean someone published the  . . .
'Marcel Marceau University' in a paper? Oh, n-o-o-o-o!" Datamation
still publishes staff written satirical material in its monthly
"Over The Edge" column.  Moore said there are a number of
subscribers who mistake it for reality every issue.

The reader may note that academic research appears to be fraught
with hidden danger when one lacks an appropriate sense of humor.

MARCH 1997 TECHNOQUACK WATCH


Golden Pizzle of Information: any authority figure accustomed to being
publicized unquestioningly; or, computer experts fond of making dumbly
obvious, fraudulent, indecipherable or insane statements which few
dare to seriously question.

Usage: Assuming the leaden mantle of _Golden Pizzle of Information_,
Microsoft's Nathan Myhrvold told a rapt audience that computers would
be able to outsmart people in the next decade or two.

------------

Reuters, the international news wire frequently cited by Crypt Newsletter
as an example of mainstream info-rubbish, reported Microsoft's
Nathan Myhrvold declaiming before credulous masses from within the
redoubt of the fiftieth anniversary conference of the Association of
Computing Machines.

"We're not getting smarter every year. [Computers] are," quacked
Myhrvold, as published by Reuters. As proof of the imminent superiority
of computers, Myhrvold claimed "Humans take 20 years to boot."



LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:
======================

A LONE VOICE OF SANITY CRIES OUT FROM THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL WILDERNESS

Dear Crypt:

I am a Department of Defense international law attorney researching
legal aspects of information warfare [don't stop reading].  A number
of my colleagues and myself are thinking that the whole information warfare
thing has been blown out of proportion. The purveyors are saying that we
will have to rewrite the entire foundation of international law
to accommodate IW. Since this claim struck me as hysterical, I was
delighted to find your refreshing newsletter. If you know of any other
useful sites, especially the internet address location of the infamous
GAO report, I would appreciate a response.

Sincerely,

A concerned law attorney at DoD

[Your gut feeling is correct.  Information warfare is many things:
the old wine of psy-ops, electronic warfare and network security in
new bottles, a hook used to drag moribund careers from the frozen muck
of the Cold War, mind-numbing exaggeration, and healthy doses of
international paranoia and fear-mongering. Skepticism makes for healthy
intellectual armor. Keep your bullshit detector set to "destroy" at all
times.

The Federation of American Scientists' Cyberstrategy Project is an
excellent source of information. The GAO reports, I believe, are
also mirrored here (or links to them).

DATAMATION BITES ACADEMICS
==========================

This isn't the first time, though the incident I remember did *not*
involve spoofs, it just involved Datamation's (ahem) casual approach
to verifying some of its facts and the declining state of modern
scholarship.

About a dozen years ago the MIT Press published this book on the history
of computing, written by some guy who had been chief somethingorother at
IBM France. The book was intended as a serious reference work in computer
history. Gordon Bell, an old hand in the computer business (chief
engineer of DEC and hip deep in some of their best early work), wrote a
truly scathing review that cited one factual blunder after another.

The author wrote a rebuttal, most of which consisted of "It's not my
fault. I copied the info out of Datamation's 'Twenty Years Ago' column
and *they* should have gotten it right.

If I ever have to teach a class on doing research, I'm going to use that
review and rebuttal as an example.

What?  You've been reading Crypt Newsletter regularly and you
haven't purchased a copy of "The Virus Creation Labs"??

Well, what are you waiting for?  A gold-plated personal invitation?

What people are saying about THE VIRUS CREATION LABS:

     "Crypt Newsletter editor George C. Smith's entire book exposes an
     insane world where everybody claws at each others' throats -- and
     where even the virus writers have marketing departments. 172 pages
     written with an utterly cynical sense of humor . . . This book gets
     my highest recommendation. Required reading for anybody
     who claims the sky is falling in the computer world."

                      ---Rob Rosenberger, Computer Virus Myths,
                         October 1996

     "I couldn't stop reading it . . . As hype continues to
     build about security on the Internet and movies like
     _Hackers_ ooze the real hackers into the mainstream arena,
     this book is definite apropos material for the time.
     Read it! A+"
                      ---The Net magazine, February 1996


     "[VIRUS CREATION LABS] is informative and stunningly
     incisive . . . "
                      ---Secure Computing, October 1995

     "George Smith . . . takes a look at the world of virus writers
     and anti-virus software vendors in a style similar to that
     of 'Cyberpunks' -- anecdotal, humorous and revealing . . . a
     lucid and entertaining read."

                      ---Computer Security Journal


     "There are relatively few books on the 'computer underground' that
     provide richly descriptive commentary and analysis of personalities
     and culture that simultaneously grab the reader with entertaining
     prose. Among the classics are Cliff Stoll's 'The Cuckoo's Egg,'
     Katie Hafner and John Markoff's 'Cyberpunk,' and Bruce
     Sterling's 'The Hacker Crackdown.'  Add George Smith's
     'The Virus Creation Labs' to the list . . . 'Virus Creation
     Labs' is about viruses as M*A*S*H is about war!"

                       ---Jim Thomas, Computer underground
                       Digest 7.18, March 5, 1995

     "THE VIRUS CREATION LABS dives into the hoopla of the Michelangelo
     media blitz and moves on to become an engaging, articulate,
     wildly angry diatribe on the world of computer virus writers . . .
     Expert reporting."
