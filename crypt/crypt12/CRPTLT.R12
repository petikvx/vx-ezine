      MICHELANGELO HYPE REVISITED: A SKEPTIC'S VIEW 
      ********************************************************************

      Just about a year ago the media exploded with weird stories of
      impending catastrophe at the hands of a mysterious computer program.
      Thrown a newsprint and TV body-block by techno-impaired editors and 
      reporters lacking even the sense to pour piss from a boot, the world 
      reeled. But the sky refused to fall and in the best tradition of 
      "calendar" journalism, the Crypt Newsletter has received permission 
      to reprint a critique of the events surrounding March 6, 1992. 
      
     "THE LITTLE VIRUS THAT DIDN'T: The press couldn't get enough
     of Michelangelo.  But did it fall prey or save the day?"

     Republished from the Washington Journalism Review, May 1992.

     The great Michelangelo computer virus scare of 1992 has proved to be
     another classic example of Chicken Little journalism -- or the 
     Reporters Who Cried Wolf, depending on your tast in fairy tales.

     At first glance, the story was a sexy one.  The virus had an
     instantly recognizable name.  It was attached to a specific date --
     March 6 --an attractive hook for editors with a penchant for calendar

                                  Page 1 

     journalism.  It was simple: On the birthday of its namesake, the virus
     would destroy data within the computers it had infiltrated through
     infected disks.  And it boasted big numbers:  By one estimate, as many
     as 5 million IBM and IBM-compatible computers worldwide were going
     to be victims of Michelangelo, a relatively small computer code written
     and unleashed by an anonymous, devious programmer.

     Newspapers around the country ran headlines warning of imminent
     disaster. "Thousands of PC's could crash Friday," said USA Today.
     "Deadly Virus Set to Wreak Havoc Tomorrow," said the Washington Post.
     "Paint It Scary," said the Los Angeles Times.

     Weeks after M-day, many antiviral software vendors and some reporters
     still insist the coverage prevented thousands of computers from
     losing data.  John Schneidawind of USA Today says "everyone's PC's
     would have crashed" had the media not paid much attention to 
     Michelangelo.

     The San Jose Mercury News credited the publicity with saving the day.
     One widely quoted antiviral vendor, John McAfee of McAfee Associates,
     says the press deserves a medal.

     In reality, many of the predictions were suspect.  Those making them,
     often computer security product vendors or closely related industry
     associations, usually stood to profit from the widespread coverage.
     And many reporters bit hard.

     One vendor who played a key role was McAfee, one of the nation's
     leading antiviral software manufacturers and founder and chairman
     of the nonprofit Computer Virus Industry Association (CVIA). It was
     McAfee who told many reporters that as many as 5 million computers
     were at risk.  He says he made the projection based on a study
     that the virus had infected 15 percent of computers at 600 sites.
     Both Reuters and the Associated Press sent the figure around the world.

     McAfee says he didn't present it the way it was reported.  "I told 
     reporters all along that estimates ranged from 50,000 to 5 million,"
     he says. "I said, '50,000 to 5 million, take your pick,' and they 
     did."

     But researcher Charles Rutstein of the International Computer
     Security Association (ICSA), a for profit consulting group,
     says even 50,000 was an exaggeration. Also widely quoted,
     Rutstein says he told reporters early on to expect no more than
     10,000 computers infected worldwide.  (There are more than 35 million
     computers in the United States alone, according to some estimates.)
     "Five million is just ridiculous, but the press believed it because
     they had no reason not to," Rutstein says now.  "McAfee seems
     credible."  (McAfee responds that the ICSA and other critics are
     "fringe groups.")

     While many articles failed to disclose or merely mentioned in passing
     that McAfee's antiviral software has sold more than 7 million copies
     of its Viruscan and expects revenues of more than $20 million this year,
     McAfee scoffs at the idea that he or other vendors hyped the threat
     to generate sales.  "I never contacted a single reporter, I never sent
     out a press release, I never wrote any articles," he says.  "I was just 
     sitting here doing my job and people started calling."  He maintains 
     that the coverage of Michelangelo cost him money. "It was the
     worst thing for our business, short-term," he says.  "We offer
     shareware [where users are trusted to pay], so we got tons of calls
     from non-paying customers.

                                     Page 2


     "Before the media starts to crucify the antivirus community," he
     continues, "they should look in the mirror and see how much [of the
     coverage] came from their desire to make it a good story." But
     he adds quickly, "Not that I'm a press-basher."

     Schneidawind's and AP's efforts after March 6 to track Michelangelo
     found only a few thousand afflicted computers worldwide, including
     2,400 erroneously reported to be at the New Jersey Institute of
     Technology.  The institute actually had only 400 computers infected
     with any virus; few had Michelangelo.  A Philadelphia Inquirer
     reporter got it wrong, says institute spokeman Paul Hassen, and it
     spread quickly.  "That was the first time I've been that close to
     a feeding frenzy," he says.  Perhaps the most embarrassed news
     organization was CNN, which on March 6 staked out McAfee's offices
     in Santa Clara, California, waiting for a doomsday that never
     came.

     Soon after the clock struck midnight on March 6, may reporters
     seemed to suspect they'd been had.  The Los Angeles Times, which
     had quoted McAfee's 5 million figure on March 4, carried a
     Reuters story three days later that reported the "Black Death"
     had turned out to be little more than "a common cold."
     AP downgraded its "mugger hiding in the closet" to a mere "electronic
     prank."

     AP Deputy Business Editor Rick Gladstone says the wire service
     quickly downplayed the story after its initial reports and included
     comments from the ICSA's Rutstein, who said the threat from the
     virus had been exaggerated.  "Our big oversight was to quote
     McAfee's 5 million figure in the beginning of the coverage but we
     backed off that," Gladstone says, adding that his staff "felt
     somewhat vindicated" when relatively few computers were affected on
     March 6. "Some of us in the press were suckered," he says.

     Schneidawind doesn't feel he was.  "We went into this with our
     eyes open," he says.  But on March 9, in an article entitled
     "Computer virus more fright than might" (the subhead was a
     more confident "Michelangelo kept at bay by early detection"),
     the USA Today reporter chronicled his frustrations tracking the
     virus.  He reported that he had asked Rutstein and McAfee, again
     identified as the CVIA chairman, to provide a working sample
     of Michelangelo.  Both declined.  "It'd be like giving him a
     biological virus because he wanted to play with it," McAfee says.
     McAfee was also "reluctant to divulge the names of companies 
     struck by the virus" according to Reuters.

     McAfee now estimates that only 10,000 systems were stricken
     worldwide on March 6, a number he says he derived by counting the
     number of calls he received from victims and guessing that they
     estimated 5 percent of the total.  But he insists the numbers
     aren't as important as "the scope of the problem," which, he says
     the press largely ignored. "For the first time, you had large
     well-respected companies shipping the virus with their new computers
     and software.  How did it filter into secure environments like
     that?"

     Schneidawind agrees.  "The estimates may have been overblown,
     but no one new for sure until the 6th," he says.  "Consider the
     BCCI scandal, where everyone faulted the press for not being there.
     I'd rather err on the side of caution."


                                     Page 3

     Schneidawind didn't seem to do that in a sidebar to his March 9 article
     in which he listed other computer pests poised to strike in March.
     Supplied by yet another antiviral software vendor, the list did not
     reveal that most of the bugs were either variants of the same
     root virus -- known as "Jerusalem" -- or rare species found only
     in eastern Europe.  Like many others the story did not make clear
     that every week of the year is filled with trigger dates for
     numerous viruses.  (Or that user mistakes destroy more data than
     viruses do.) More importantly, only a handful of some
     1,000 worldwide viruses are common enough that a user may
     occasionally encounter one.  Of those, most only display silly
     messages or compel the computer to play a tune.

     On March 6, Michael Rogers and Bob Cohn of Newsweek offered a post
     mortem to Michelangelo that warned readers to "beware the next round
     of computer viruses," including the Maltese Amoeba and "the scariest
     new virus . . . the Mutation Engine."  What they and others such as
     Ted Koppel of ABC's Nightline and John Fried and Michael Rozansky
     of the Philadelphia Inquirer failed to say was that the Maltese Amoeba
     had only been active in Ireland.  Moreover, the Mutation Engine isn't
     a virus at all, but a user-friendly encryption tool that virus-writers
     use to disguise their creations.

     To their credit, neither The New York Times nor The Wall Street Journal
     gave much credence to Michelangelo.  John Markoff of the Times in
     particular provided restrained, intelligent coverage that virtually 
     ignored McAfee and other antivirus vendors.  And The Journal's Walter
     Mossberg wrote a "Personal Technology" column that realistically 
     appraised the viral threat as minimal.

     Unfortunately, the hype over Michelangelo could cause wary journalists
     to ignore more prevalent destructive viruses that could occur in
     the future.  It will cause more of the rogue programs to be
     circulated, if only because their creators love the
     attention.  For some soul, the coverage given to
     Michelangelo must have provided quite an adrenalin rush. It certainly
     did for the press.
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     As for a look back a year later:
     

       1. Whatever happened to the Maltese Amoeba? The answer:
       Who cares?

       2. Where is the sound of PC's crashing in 1993 to the tune 
       of the "scariest new virus . . . the Mutation Engine"?

     MODEL ANTI-VIRUS AUTHOR LEGISLATION PRESSED INTO THE
     HANDS OF THE CRYPT NEWSLETTER:  PETER TIPPETT HAS
     COMPANY NAME ATTACHED TO RISIBLE DRIVEL
     *****************************************************************


     Recently we've had the time to look over a back issue of
     Virus News and Reviews which contained some "model"
     legislation designed for the express purpose of combating 
     computer viruses. Devised by Peter Tippett of Certus International,
     the document makes clear that it was written to impress people 
     ignorant of computers in even the most general sense. It 
     propagates the idiotic notion that writing viruses is some kind 
     of specialized skill, or "art" as Tippett puts it, and by 

                                     Page 4

     regulating individuals expert in the "art," the computer virus 
     problem can be solved.

     For example, an excerpt from Tippett's "model" in Virus News
     and Reviews (July 1992):
     
     "A computer virus may only be created or modified, but never sold,
     distributed, or allowed to be distributed, for bonafide research
     purposes, and then only under the following circumstances:


     "1. The virus is created for a legitimate, localized research
     purpose;


     "2. Strict provisions are made to always contain the virus within
     the expressed domain of its author/researcher and to not allow the
     virus to replicate or otherwise move to any media or computing
     system outside of the author's/researcher's direct control;

     "3. At least five days before any computer virus is created or
     modified under this sub-part, the intent to create or modify a
     computer virus must be publicly announced by its intended author in
     at least three publicly available publications, each with a
     circulation of at least 100,000. The announcement will contain at
     least: 
     1)  the name, company, title, address and telephone number of the
     responsible party, 
     2) the name, company, title, address and telephone number of the
     computer virus author, if different than the responsible party, 
     3) the address and location of the intended research, 
     4) the start date and intended finish date of the intended
     research, and 
     5) the expressed intent to create or modify a computer virus.


     "4. The research or study virus, or virus modification must contain
     within its own code, and in a form that survives replication to all
     progeny of the parent virus, the name of the responsible party and
     other information sufficient for anyone of average skill in the art
     to reliably discover."

     Point 1 calls for the formation of a judging group which will appraise
     virus research as worthy of license.  To this day, no such group 
     exists in any field of scientific (professional or non-professional)
     endeavor, at least not in the way envisioned by Tippett's model
     legislation.  The closest things to this are government research and
     granting agencies like the National Science Foundation.  But,
     while the NSF doesn't have to grant money for research it 
     feels inexpert or uninteresting, it has no power to make it taboo. 
     (It can create an environment where certain avenues of research 
     are seen as "unfundable." This can be crippling in some fields, 
     but not in this case where just about anyone with a couple
     PC's, a modem and a real desire to work can set up shop.)
     Tippett's legislation would be a first in this regard.  We think this 
     is a laughable assumption that shows a typical businessman's lack of 
     knowledge about how the critical pursuit of information  
     proceeds in any field. (In an aside: Tippett's writing brings 
     to mind Robert X. Cringely's assessment of Lotus Development's 
     Jim Manzi as an American businessman who shuns PC's, hates using 
     them and considers researchers and technical people "dickheads.")


                                     Page 5

     In Point 3, Tippett requires publication notice for virus creation.
     This is an unenforceable bureaucratic requirement which would be 
     unlikely to be taken seriously even by people working in a 
     "legitimized" environment. 

     As for Point 4: Many virus authors and researchers already put plenty
     of identification in their creations.  This hasn't changed anything
     nor does it prevent people from erasing or altering such identification
     at whim. This point serves no obvious purpose and, in our opinion, 
     is legally meaningless. 
     
     The remainder of Tippett's "model" is similarly uninformed as to the
     reality of virus construction and distribution, embarrassing when  
     one considers that he's published in Virus News and Review. But
     perhaps this is intentional, since the facts are difficult to 
     adequately describe in a mere one-page letter. As a "paper" or 
     proposal in any college course worth its salt, Tippett's submission
     would gain a solid F.  But for congressional legitimacy, if that's 
     its aim, excellence is not a requirement. Maybe Peter Tippett 
     is a lot smarter than we think.

     IN THE READING ROOM:  VIRUS - THE COMIC BOOK!
     ********************************************************************

     It had to happen.  There have been sci-fi and techno-thrillers
     about viruses, so WHY NOT a comic book?

     You'd expect this to be strange, but so what! Aren't a lot of 
     comics? Why should "Virus,"  published by Dark Horse, be
     an exception?

     But first, a little background.  Dark Horse has made its name
     by peddling an endless flood of titles devoted to squeezing 
     the last drop of greenish ichor from movies like "Alien" and 
     "Predator." That philosophy ensures just about anything it 
     prints is a big hit, selling out immediately in the kinds of comic 
     stores run by tubercular, ex-artfags with an intense dislike 
     for patrons who don't reserve at least ten new titles each
     month.

     You'd imagine, then, that a copy of "Virus" was tough for 
     The Crypt Newsletter to find. It was. And if not for alert reader 
     Captain AeroSmith who shipped one air-freight from Cleveland, we 
     might not have seen it at all.

     That said, the first issue of "Virus" wasn't bad.  Fair art, good
     dialogue and a story that revolves around an abandoned Chinese
     radar and telemetry ship that comes under the power of some
     inter-cosmic computer virus that has beamed down into its radio
     antenna and set up shop in the mainframe.  The original crew is
     butchered, necessitating the trapping of some ocean-wandering riff-raff
     who think they're going to appropriate the boat for lots of cash
     money. "Virus" nixes this plan at once by ripping the 
     breast-bone out of one of the thieves with the aid of a 
     computer-controlled winch.

     "Aaaiiieeee!" screech the trapped sailors. They want out, but not 
     before being attacked by something that looks like a cross between 
     a kite and a flying pipe-wrench made from sails and human integuement.
     What does this have to do with viruses or the computer

                                     Page 6

     underground? Who knows! "Virus" is cracked, but I guarantee you'll 
     be negotiating with your local dealer for the next issue.

     IN THE READING ROOM II:  MONDO 2000 - A User's Guide To The
     New Edge by R. U. Sirius, Queen Mu and Rudy Rucker (HaperPerennial)
     *******************************************************************

        "Thanks for a country where no one's allowed to mind their
        own business . . . Thanks for a nation of finks." 
                 --William S. Burroughs in "Mondo 2000"

     I'm no expert on the "cyberpunk" magazine, but MONDO 2000 -
     the book - squeezed a smirk out of me when the William Burroughs 
     quote cropped up amidst non sequiturs and chapters on pranking the 
     media and "smart" drugs.  That the wizened author of "Naked Lunch" is 
     now a center piece in such an effort surely has some kind of 
     quantum significance. So, know that MONDO 2000 is the literary 
     equivalent of a Ren & Stimpy cartoon: stretches of intense 
     flatulence punctuated by flashes of brilliance and dumb cunning.
     [Much like the Crypt Newsletter, perhaps.]
     
     For instance, the chapters on "smart" drugs and tarantulas (?!)
     are patent nonsense.  The "smart" drug idea comes from that
     small segment of the populace who've accidentally rediscovered 
     how absorbing a read the Physician's Desk Reference is when your mind
     has that "roasted" character that comes from too many simultaneous 
     hits of caffeine and unfiltered Camels. Tarantulas, Queen Mu says, 
     are deadly, too. (I knew it, I knew there had to be a reason they 
     sell the ugly things to any schnook who goes into a pet store!)

     If you can overlook stuff like that, MONDO 2000 is hep.  
     Rudy Rucker's introductory essay, for one thing, is inspirational.
     And there's plenty of weird computer jokes, BBS's to call, 
     summaries of all the important stuff that's gone down in "cyberspace" 
     in the past ten years - in other words, MONDO 2000's a good book for 
     the coffee table. It will impress your friends, I bet.

     QUICK AND DIRTY DISASSEMBLY OF VIRUS CODE: THE SANDRA VIRUS - 
     AN ENCRYPTED ANTI-ANTI-VIRUS VIRUS SPILLS ITS SECRETS TO ANY
     LAYMAN
     *******************************************************************
     This month, two articles crossed Crypt Newsletter desks that painted 
     the picture that virus disassembly is a job best left to the experts.
     It is a common myth - a nuts, self-serving statement propagated by 
     greedheads who WANT you to think that you are a helpless schnook.  
     In reality, anyone who works seriously with viruses knows that in 
     90% all cases, virus disassembly is about a 5-minute job, tops.

     As an illustration, the Crypt Newsletter will walk you through
     a quick and dirty dissection of the SANDRA virus using only
     two tools: the shareware ZanySoft debugger and the retail Sourcer
     commenting disassembler programs.

     Since the Sandra virus came into this country as a "naked" file, there
     is little need to instruct you in how to execute the
     virus onto a clean, small, workable "host."  Since no virus researcher
     had to do it, we will presume, in this case, that you won't have 
     to either. (And that leaves room for another chapter in this
     story in the next issue.)


                                     Page 7

     The first step is a no-brainer.  Fire up Sourcer with the following
     command line (this presumes you have created the SANDRA virus from
     the DEBUG script supplied with the Crypt Newsletter):

                 C>SR SANDRA.COM

     This will load SANDRA into Sourcer and bring up the disassembler's
     menu. The Sourcer defaults will suffice, so hit "G" for GO.
     In less than 15 seconds Sourcer will have coughed out a file
     called SANDRA.LST.  Take a look at it. By the black-coated
     turd from Jesus's arse! What gibberish. You'll see that SANDRA 
     appears to be a small segment of cryptic assembly code instructions, 
     then some words that almost look like English and quite an oodle of 
     hexadecimal values arrayed in columnar "define byte" (or "db") 
     format.

     This immediately tells the experienced that SANDRA is
     encrypted, and rather weirdly at that. (If SANDRA had been unencrypted,
     your job would be finished. The virus would be laid out in front
     of you.)

     The next step, then, is to trick the virus into decrypting itself
     and then writing the "plain text" version to disk.  This is simple
     in theory, only slightly more difficult in practice.  Envision that
     the portion of the virus you want to execute is the decryptor
     loop, a small stretch of instructions which will unscramble the
     virus in memory. Might not that segment of cryptic assembly gobble
     that Sourcer produced on its first pass contain the keys to
     the decryptor? Yup, good guess.  And it looks like this:



        seg_a           segment byte public
                        assume  cs:seg_a, ds:seg_a


                          org     100h

                          sandra          proc    far

         3C44:0100                    start:
         3C44:0100  F8                              clc                             ; Clear carry flag
         3C44:0101  E8 002F                         call    sub_2   ; (0133)
         3C44:0104  FB                              sti   ; Enable interrupts
         3C44:0105  F8                              clc   ; Clear carry flag
         3C44:0106  <--execute to this address     jmp     loc_6   ;*(027C)
         3C44:0106  E9 73 01                        db      0E9h, 73h, 01h
         3C44:0109  3C              data_3          db      3Ch                     ;  xref 3C44:013D
         3C44:010A  00              data_4          db      0                       ;  xref 3C44:0149

         You notice that SANDRA starts by calling a sequence of instructions
         dubbed "sub_2" by Sourcer.  Looking down the listing (which is
         not included here) you see that "sub_2" is another segment of
         plain-text assembly code.  This is the viral unscrambler and when
         we have returned from it, the virus is ready to cook off.  The next
         job for SANDRA, then, is to begin its work.  Looking at
         the assembly commands above, you see SANDRA jumps (jmp) to a new
         location, which looks encrypted in the listing you're
         working on.

         The idea you want to use is that by executing the virus right
         up to the "jmp,"  it's possible to get it to translate itself

                                     Page 8

         in memory without it looking for a file to infect, infecting that
         file and re-garbling itself.  This is easy to do with any
         debugger.  We'll use the ZanySoft product because it's  not
         as intimidating as DOS's DEBUG to the novice user. In fact,
         it is almost idiot-proof and requires little overhead on 
         the part of anyone.

         Fire up the ZanySoft debugger by typing:
           
                 C>ZD86

        ZanySoft is menu driven.  Use its "File" drop-down menu to
        load the virus.  Then bring down its "Run" menu and double-click
        on the "go to xxxx:xxxx" command.  This tells ZanySoft to
        execute the loaded program to a certain address - which it
        will prompt you to supply -- and stop.  The address needed is 
        the one corresponding to the "jmp" in the above listing. Sourcer 
        has supplied it, and it is ear-marked in the diagram: 0106.

        Type in 0106 at ZanySoft's prompt and hit  <enter>.  The virus 
        is decrypted.  Now, return to the "Files"
        menu and select the option, "Write to .COM." Accept the
        default value ZanySoft brings up and hit <enter> again.  The
        virus has now been written to the disk from memory, and in
        "plain-text" or unencrypted form.  Look at it under a file
        viewer. Remember those words that looked like English?  Well,
        now they ARE English.  You should see some gobble like "the
        Nazg'l," "dedicated to Sandra H.", and "*.EXE," "*.COM," the
        latter two giveaways that the virus hunts for these files.

        Load the unencrypted virus into Sourcer once again. Accept
        the defaults and hit "Go".  Fifteen seconds later the
        virus has been disassembled for you, only now it's almost
        all assembly instructions.  Is this so mysterious?  Even
        though you may know next to nothing about assembly, you can
        still use the Sourcer listing to make some informed deductions
        about the virus.

        Go to the bottom of the listing and look at the interrupt
        usage synopsis. It looks like this:

        ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±± Interrupt Usage Synopsis ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±
           Interrupt 16h : Keyboard i/o  ah=function xxh
           Interrupt 20h : DOS program terminate
           Interrupt 21h : DOS Services  ah=function xxh
           Interrupt 21h :  ah=2Ch  get time, cx=hrs/min, dx=sec
           Interrupt 21h :  ah=3Bh  set current dir, path @ ds:dx
           Interrupt 21h :  ah=3Ch  create/truncate file @ ds:dx
           Interrupt 21h :  ah=3Dh  open file, al=mode,name@ds:dx
           Interrupt 21h :  ah=3Eh  close file, bx=file handle
           Interrupt 21h :  ah=40h  write file  bx=file handle
           Interrupt 21h :  ah=41h  delete file, name @ ds:dx
           Interrupt 21h :  ax=4301h  set attrb cx, filename @ds:dx
           Interrupt 21h :  ah=4Eh  find 1st filenam match @ds:dx
           Interrupt 21h :  ah=4Fh  find next filename match
           Interrupt 21h :  ax=5701h  set file date+time, bx=handle

        As you see, SANDRA has instructions for "find first filename
        match", "find next filename match" and "set current directory,
        path."  If you've seen this newsletter and its source listings
        before, you might suspect that SANDRA is a direct-action
        (or non-resident) virus. Coupled with the .COM/.EXE filemasks, 
        that's a good, educated guess.

                                     Page 9


        Like any virus, it has a "write to file" function. However, in
        this case, cross-referencing your listing shows that SANDRA 
        doesn't worry about adding itself to the end of the file during 
        the write. This means SANDRA's an "overwriter." It's the simplest 
        kind of infector, a feature exclusively the domain of primitive
        direct-action viruses. And since it means that the virus
        destroys everything it lands on, an instantly noticeable
        stunt, it marks SANDRA as a trivial pest at best.

        Your eye might also be drawn to the "delete file" and
        "truncate file" functions.  "Ah-ha!" you say having
        a vague understanding about how sneaky viruses work.  
        SANDRA deletes files corresponding to the list of plain-text 
        filenames it carries around. And those file names are for 
        anti-virus software programs!  SANDRA is an anti-anti-virus 
        virus! Wow.

        Now you know enough to broadly characterize SANDRA as an
        encrypted, over-writing virus that tries to delete a
        raft of anti-virus programs. You might even be tempted
        to run a test and execute SANDRA against some bait files.
        If you do that on a typical American system, you'll find
        another interesting feature at once.  A great many systems
        now use WINDOWS, and that means they're set up with either
        QEMM or MS-DOS's EMM386 as memory managers.  If SANDRA is
        executed on any of these environments it will generate an
        "exception" forcing a reboot of the machine.  
        
        Why is that, for cryin' out loud?  Actually, it's another
        anti-anti-virus measure, although a back-handed one.
        NEMESIS, a German memory resident anti-virus monitor
        uses expanded memory to monitor a system at the sector
        level.  Because of this, it requires the user to have
        the requisite amount of expanded memory and the manager
        for it: QEMM or EMM.  SANDRA seems to make the generous 
        assumption that any machine using one of these might have
        NEMESIS installed, and it forces a shutdown through EMM
        to stop the infection and avoid potential detection.
        Since SANDRA appears to be German, it is not unreasonable
        that its author might be more concerned about NEMESIS
        than anyone in the U.S., where the program is nonexistent.
        In real terms, this feature makes SANDRA, at best,
        a reluctant virus.  On many machines, it will just
        flat out refuse to infect.

        By further combing over the code on breaks from hanging about
        the water-cooler, you'll find that SANDRA deletes the
        following data-integrity files from selected a-v software:

       - "ANTIVIR.DAT"
       - "CHKLIST.CPS"    --Central Point AV
       - "C:\CPAV\CHKLIST.CPS" --same as above
       - "C:\NAV_._NO"         --Norton Antivirus
       - "NOVIRCVR.CTS"
       - "NOVIPERF.DAT"
       - "C:\TOOLKIT\FSIZES.LST" --Solomon's Toolkit
       - "C:\FSIZES.QCV"      --Solomon's Toolkit
       - "C:\UNTOUCH\UT.UT1"  --Untouchable
       - "C:\UNTOUCH\UT.UT2"  --Untouchable
       - "C:\VS.VS"
       - "C:\TBAV\VIRSCAN.DAT" --Thunderbyte, truncates file

                                     Page 10

       - "C:\)(.ID -- Integrity Master, I believe

       By now, you're very confident you can execute SANDRA without
       hurting yourself. Actually, you could have done that after
       a quick look at the interrupt synopsis. In any case, you're
       still cautious so you install FLU-SHOT.  Haha! SANDRA
       won't infect. And you've uncovered its last interesting
       secret: it exits when FLU-SHOT or a couple of other
       resident programs are present.

       This isn't the definitive book on SANDRA, but it's more than
       enough for reasonable purposes.  After all, this IS the "quick and
       dirty" guide to virus disassembly. And the rules here can be
       applied to a full 90% of the viruses you might come across.
       Sure, there can be the occasional bird with tricks in it
       to make this kind of fast interpretation a thorny job.
       But, chances are, you will never see one.

       So after a few more stabs at this with viruses from the
       newsletter, your home collection, or wherever, you can sell 
       yourself as an experienced hand at "quick & dirty" virus
       disassembly.

       THE LOKJAW PROGRAMS: MORE SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF RETALIATING
       ANTI-ANTI-VIRUS VIRUSES
       ****************************************************************

       Intrigued by the Proto-T scam, virus writer Nikademus sent his
       LOCKJAW program to the Crypt Newsletter for examination.  The
       Nikademus LOCKJAW virus is a variant of "Proto-T," a resident
       .COM infector originally derived from Civil War, altered to 
       delete a series of anti-virus programs when they are executed. 
       As an added fillip, the virus marks the deletion with an 
       entertaining "chomping" graphic effect!

       The easiest way to soak this up is to head right for the assembly
       listings included in this issue.  The actual file recognition 
       and deletion routines can be adapted for many resident viruses.
       As an example, the newsletter has transformed LOCKJAW into a
       spawning .EXE-infecting virus in its "ZWEI" and "DREI" variants.
       File deletion on load isn't novel in resident viruses. But by
       coupling it to anti-virus recognition LOCKJAW underscores the
       necessity of having the user realize he MUST remove the virus
       from memory before using his software, or at the very least, 
       operate from a write-protected diskette. (Although, as you will
       see with LOKJAW-DREI, the latter step is also potentially dodgey
       business.)

       In the wild, the entertaining virus "chomp" would be removed, as it
       is a dead giveaway that the virus is present and in control
       of the machine. (For that matter, so is sudden file deletion.
       But the effect would remain puzzling to uninformed users.)
       
       Taking this idea one step further, LOKJAW-DREI is a modification
       which removes file deletion and replaces it with a fake
       disk-trashing routine which the virus uses to strike the hard file
       when an anti-virus program is called to find it.

       Although LOKJAW-DREI only makes the drive temporarily inacessible,
       it doesn't take a great leap of imagination to see its

                                     Page 11

       potential. Mark Ludwig talked about this at length in an article
       on "retaliating viruses" published in American Eagle's "Computer
       Virus Developments Quarterly #1" In that issue he supplied the
       code for such an animal, the direct action Retaliator virus, an 
       Intruder variant. 
       
       The point that he made, and a valid one, is that the existence
       of such a virus on a machine makes it absolutely necessary
       that the user know what he's doing when he goes out looking
       for it. 
       
       The LOCKJAW viruses, however, are easy to "play" with.  They 
       will become resident below the 640k boundary and infect .COMs or 
       .EXE's, depending upon the variant, upon execution. They will 
       also show a noticeable 4k drop in memory available to free programs.
       By running Scan, F-Prot, Integrity Master or Central 
       Point Anti-Virus when LOCKJAW is present, the "retaliating" 
       effect is shown. Of course, this software is deleted so
       don't use your only copy unless you want it erased. (Not a
       bad strategy for some software.)

       LOCKJAW can be removed from memory by simply rebooting from a
       clean, write-protected system disk.
       
       [In a related note:  The SANDRA and LOKJAW viruses come with 
       Central Point Anti-virus as a default.  Even though the
       software is continually drubbed in product reviews and word-of
       mouth gossip, it is included in the coming MS-DOS 6.0.  This
       ensures that it will be even more ubiquitous on home and business
       machines in 1993 - a fact of interest to virus and competing
       anti-virus developers alike.]

       IN THE READING ROOM III: CRITIQUE OF DISCOVER PIECE ON THE
       BULGARIAN VIRUS CONNECTION
       ***************************************************************

       I'm sure a number of alert newsletter readers have, by now, 
       browsed through the February issue of Discover magazine and seen 
       the excerpt from another book on "hackers" called "Approaching Zero," 
       to be published by Random House. The digested portion is from a 
       chapter dealing with what authors' Bryan Clough and Paul Mungo call 
       "the Bulgarian virus connection."

       While it was interesting - outwardly a brightly written 
       article - to someone a little more familiar with the subject matter
       than the average Discover reader, it was another flawed attempt
       at getting the story right for a glossy magazine-type readership.

       First, we were surprised that reporters Mungo and Clough fell 
       short of an interview with virus author, the Dark Avenger.  Since 
       they spent so much time referring to him and publishing a few 
       snippets of his mail, it was warranted, even if he is a very tough 
       contact.

       In addition, they continually exaggerate points for the sake of 
       sensationalism. As for their claim that the Dark Avenger's "Mutating 
       Engine"  maybe being the "most dangerous virus ever produced,"  
       there's no evidence to support it.  First, they continue the 
       hallowed media tradition of calling the Mutation Engine 
       a virus. It's not. The Mutation Engine is a device which we've gone

                                     Page 12

       over in these pages again and again. 
  
       The Crypt reader knows it doesn't automatically make the virus 
       horribly destructive, that's a feature virus-writers put into 
       viruses separate from the Engine.  
 
       And although the first Mutation Engine viruses introduced into 
       the U.S. could not be detected by scanners included in 
       commercial anti-virus software, most of these packages included 
       tools to monitor data passively on any machine.  These tools 
       COULD detect Mutation Engine viruses, a fact that can still be 
       demonstrated with copies of the software. And one that almost 
       everyone covering the Mutation Engine angle glosses over, if they 
       bother to mention it at all. In any case, Mutation Engine code 
       is well understood and viruses equipped with it are now no more 
       hidden than viruses which don't include it. 
 
       Of greater interest, and an issue Mungo and Clough don't get to, is 
       the inspiration the Dark Avenger Mutation Engine supplied to virus 
       programmers.  
 
       By the summer of 1992, disassembled versions of the Mutation Engine 
       were everywhere, for all intents.
  
       It seemed only a matter of time before similar code kernels with 
       more sophisticated properties popped up and this has been the case.   
       Coffeeshop, a virus mentioned in the original Discover piece,
       is just such an animal, although the authors don't get into it.
       Coffeeshop utilizes a slightly more sophisticated variable encryptor 
       - called the Trident Polymorphic Engine - which adds a few features 
       not present in the Dark Avenger model as well as decreasing its
       size.  It, too, has been distributed in this country as a device 
       which can be utilized by virus authors interested in shot gunning 
       it into their own creations.  It is of Dutch origin, produced by 
       a group of programmers known as "TridenT."  TridenT, a group with 
       a taste for whimsy, freely acknowledges the inspiration of 
       the Mutation Engine. Curiously, Coffeeshop is Dutch slang for a 
       place to pick up some marijuana. Very interesting, is it not?

       However, the Trident Polymorphic Engine is no more inherently 
       dangerous than the Mutation Engine.  Viruses utilizing it can be 
       detected by the same tools used to detect Mutation Engine viruses 
       before those could be scanned.

       The reporters also claim that disassembling a virus to find out 
       what it does is a "difficult and time-consuming process" capable 
       of being carried out "only by specialists."  This is another myth 
       which feeds the perception that viruses are incredibly 
       complicated and that one can only be protected from them by the 
       right combination of super-savvy experts.

       It has little basis in reality which is why we spent some time
       shooting it in the rear end in an earlier portion of this 
       issue.   

       And that's what's the most irritating about Mungo and Clough's 
       research. In search of the cool story, they further the dated idea 
       that virus-programming is some kind of arcane art, practiced by 
       "manic computer freaks" living in a few foreign countries where 
       politics and the economy are oppressive .  While it's true that 
       a few viruses are clever, sophisticated examples of programming, the 
       reality is that almost anyone (from 15-year olds to 

                                     Page 13

       middle-aged men) with a minimal understanding of assembly language 
       can (and does) write them from scratch or cobble new ones together 
       from pieces of found code or toolkits.

       Since everyone's computers DON'T seem to be crashing from viral 
       infection right and left (remember Michelangelo?), Mungo and Clough, 
       in our opinion, really stretch the danger of the "Bulgarian virus 
       factory." 

       This is such an old story it has almost become shtick, a routine 
       which researcher Vesselin Bontchev (apparently Clough and Mungo's 
       primary source) has parlayed into an intriguing career. 

       A great number of the 200 or so Bulgarian viruses the reporters 
       mention in fear-laden terms ARE already here, too  - stocked on 
       a score of BBS's run by programmers and computer enthusiasts.  
       Mungo and Clough write of "the scope of the problem . . . not 
       [becoming] apparent for several years." That's an easy, leading 
       call to make because no one will remember or hold them to it in 
       2000.  The Crypt newsletter suggests "We don't know."  
       
       Now that would have been more honest. But we doubt if it would have 
       sold as well. 

       [To add insult to injury, the authors warn of the ominous LoveChild
       virus, counting toward zero, waiting to ambush your hard file. It's
       worth noting the Skulason's F-Prot casually dismisses LoveChild as 
       a buggy virus which only operates on machines running DOS 3.3.
       Solomon's Toolkit modestly judges it as capable of "moderate" 
       damage.]

       iterated ominous news of LoveChild, a program which won't function

       IN THE READING ROOM IV: WRITER AND EX-JOCKEY DICK FRANCIS 
       REPORTS ON COMPUTER VIRUSES IN "DRIVING FORCE," HIS LATEST NOVEL 
       OF MYSTERY AND INTRIGUE
       ****************************************************************
       It turns out that one of the Crypt Newsletter staffers is a
       fiend for Dick Francis.  In case you don't know, Francis is an 
       entire publishing company unto himself. He cranks out enough 
       material in a year to give Stephen King a run for his money. 
       However, he's never been pegged as a "computer" writer.

       So it came as a surprise when a staffer shrieked in glee,
       ran over to where I was lurking by the water-cooler and
       thrust Francis's manuscript into my face.

       "Look, look, Michelangelo!!" she gibbered.  And there it
       was, a fictional account of someone's office getting cold-cocked
       by the virus.  But enough of this, here's a teaser:

       -=[ The computer man, perhaps twenty, with long light brown hair                      
       through which he ran his fingers in artistic affectation every
       few seconds, had given up trying to resuscitate our hardware by 
       the time I got back to the office.

       "What virus?" I asked, coming to a halt by by Isobel's desk
       and feeling overly beleaguered.  We had flu, we had aliens, we 
       had bodies, we had vandals, we had concussion.  A virus in
       the computer could take the camel to its knees.

       "All our records," Isobel mourned.


                                     Page 14

       "And our accounts," chimed Rose.

       "It's prudent to make backups," the computer man told them
       mock-sorrowfully, his young face more honestly full of scorn.
       "Always make backups,ladies."

       "Which virus?" I asked again.

       He shrugged, including me in his stupidity rating. "Maybe 
       Michelangelo . . . Michelangelo activates on March 6 and
       there's still a lot about."

       "Enlarge," I said.

       "Surely you know?"

       "If I knew, I've forgotten."

       He spelled it out as to an illiterate.  "March 6 is Michelangelo's
       birthday.  If you have the virus lying doggo in your computer
       and you switch on your computer on March 6, the virus activates."

       "Michelangelo is a boot-section virus," the expert said, and to
       our blank-looking expressions long-sufferingly explained. "Just
       switching the machine on does the trick. Simply switching it on,
       waiting a minute or two and switching off. Switching on is called
       booting up. All the records on your hard disk are wiped out at
       once with Michelangelo and you get the message 'Fatal disk error.'
       That's what happened to your machine. The records are gone. There's
       no putting them back."

       "What exactly is a virus?" Rose inquired miserably.
       
       "It's a program that tells the computer to jumble up or wipe
       out everything stored in it." He warmed to his subject. "There
       are at least three thousand viruses floating around. There's
       Jerusalem II that activates every Friday the 13th, that's a 
       specially nasty one.  It's caused a lot of trouble, has that
       one."

       "But what's the point?" I asked.

       "Vandalism," he said cheerfully.  "Destruction and wrecking for
       its own sake." He ran his fingers through his hair. "For instance,
       I could design a sweet little virus that would make all your
       accounts come out wrong.  Nothing spectacular like Michelangelo,
       not a complete loss of everything, just enough to drive you mad.
       Just enough to make errors so that you'd be forever checking and
       adding and nothing would ever come out right."  He loved the idea,
       one could see.  

       "How do you stop it?" I asked.

       "There are all sorts of expensive programs nowadays for detecting
       and neutralizing viruses. And a whole lot of people thinking up 
       ways to invent viruses that can't be got rid of.  It's a whole
       industry.  Lovely, I mean, rotten."

       Viruses, I reflected, meant income, to him.  ]=-

       How's that?  Not bad, for a mystery writer! Why, Francis seems 
       more knowledgable about the subject than the writers of glossy-cover

       "suit" computer publications!  But we're not gonna tell you how
       it ends, you'll just have to dig up "Driving Force" (Putnam)

       IN THE READING ROOM V:  NEW YORK TIMES AND THE PHRAKR TRAKR -
       BBS's: THE ROOT OFFAL EVIL (OUCH, PUNNY!)
       ******************************************************************

       In a January 25 'A' section article, a N.Y. Times reporter profiles
       the "Phrakr Trakr," a federal undercover man keeping our
       electronic streets safe from cybernetic hoodlums too numerous to
       mention singly.

       Reporter Ralph Blumenthal immediately reveals himself as yet 
       another investigator from the mainstream who has never gotten
       anything from underground BBS's first-hand, focusing on the
       Phrakr Trakr's tales of nameless computer criminals trafficking
       in "stolen information, poison recipes and bomb-making 
       instructions." 

       We're not going to dwell on the issue of phone-related phraud
       and the misappropriation of credit card accounts (which has
       been well-established), but Blumenthal's continued 
       attention to text files for "turning household chemicals into 
       deadly poisons, [or] how to build an 'Assassin Box' to supposedly 
       send a lethal surge through a telephone line" is sickening.  It 
       furthers the generalization that all reporters are fetal-alcohol 
       damaged rubes with little educational background beyond elementary 
       school.  Anyone who's seen or stock-piled text files on a BBS knows 
       they're either menacingly written trivial crap or bowdlerized 
       reprints from engineering, biology and chemistry books. In either 
       case, hardly noteworthy unless you're one who can't tell the 
       difference between comic books and real news.

       The Times delivers a back-to-the-camera photo of the Phrakr Trakr,
       an overweight man with a handcuff dangling from 
       his suspenders. He "patrols THOUSANDS [emphasis ours] of computer 
       bulletin boards" states the photo's slug-line, an absurd claim which 
       neatly overlooks the fact that there's not enough time in a year
       to physically accomplish the deed.  
       
       The Phrakr Trakr has his own newsletter, F.B.I., for
       "Find um [sic], Bust um [sic], Incarcerate um [sic]."  "Got any 
       codez?" indeed.

       GRAY AREAS magazine is looking to interview virus authors for
       a continuing series of articles. The Crypt Newsletter editorial
       staff recently had an opportunity to meet with the editor
       of GRAY AREAS, Netta Gilboa, and came away with the conviction
       that the magazine is dedicated to exposing all points of view
       on many subjects. In other words, you don't need a highly paid
       mouthpiece, a movie contract or the Congressional Medal of 
       Honor to be of interest to its editors.  A recent
       issue featured an excellent interview with John Perry Barlow 
       among other sections too numerous to cover adequately here.

      Phalcon/SKISM programmer Dark Angel has produced the G2, or
      Second Generation viral code generator.  Capable of producing
      resident .COM/.EXE infecting virus with limited poylmorphism,
      Dark Angel's documentation states the G2 supersedes the
      PS-MPC.  The Phalcon/SKISM programmer plans to update the G2 code 
      base as time allows; he maintains in the instructions to the program
      that G2 has much more flexibility than the PS-MPC, capable
      of multiple arrangements of commented code and data segments.

      Although the G2 is separate from the PS-MPC, it appears that
      those users familiar with the former will have no trouble 
      adapting to the latter.

      IBM - panicked by the tolling bell of impending corporate doom - has 
      moved to can CEO John Akers, presumably because the company is 
      non-competitive under his leadership.  Akers will remain to head 
      the team selected to draft his replacement. Does this make sense 
      to you or are WE nuts? Draft the guy you're firing to find his own 
      replacement.  Yes, this is a GOOD PLAN. Sell your IBM stock while 
      you still can. That's the Crypt Newsletter's advice.

        The Crypt Newsletter includes virus source code in each issue.
        If assembled, it will produce working copies of the viruses
        described.  In the hands of incompetents, irresponsibles and
        and even the experienced, these programs can mess up the software 
        resources of any IBM-compatible PC - most times, irretrievably.
        Public knowledge that you possess such samples can make you
        unpopular - even shunned - in certain circles of your computer 
        neighborhood, too.
        
        To assemble the software included in this issue of the newsletter,
        copy the MS-DOS program DEBUG.EXE to your current directory,
        unzip the newsletter archive into the same directory and
        type MAKE at the DOS prompt.  
        
        This issue of the newsletter should contain the following
        files:

                CRPTLT.R12 - this document
                MAKE.BAT - instant "maker" for this issue's software.
                Ensure that the MS-DOS program DEBUG.EXE is in the 
                machine path or current directory, before 
                typing "MAKE".
