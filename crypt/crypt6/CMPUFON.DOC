          COMPUFON is a pop-up phone directory.  But it does
          far more than store names and numbers.  If you own
          a modem, it will dial the phone number for you, too.
          Pop it up anytime you need it, even when in the middle
          of another application!

          Installed, COMPUFON consumes anywhere from 13K to 60K
          of RAM, depending on the size of the buffer YOU give it.
          And COMPUFON may be loaded into upper memory with the
          LOADHIGH command on properly configured systems.

          Install COMPUFON with the following syntax:

          COMPUFON [[d:][path]filename] [/B=size] [/M]

          where 'filename' is the name of the data file to
          load at start-up, 'size' is the number of Kb of
          memory to allow for memory storage, and /M
          for monochrome monitors.

          The larger the memory size you specify, the greater the
          number of entries you can store.  COMPUFON's minimum
          memory is 1k (enter 1), its maximum 48k (enter 48). Default
          memory if 16k.  Combined with COMPUFON's host 12k of RAM, 
          the program requires approximately 28k of RAM in default
          configuration.  The 16k memory portion can hold approximately
          300 names and phone numbers.  The maximum space will hold about
          1,000.

          If 1,000 isn't enough, break your database into several files
          and load them as needed.  You can load these files
          when COMPUFON is installed by specifying the filename at
          the command line. Or, after installation, you can pop-up
          the COMPUFON window, strike F8 and the program will 
          load any file you designate.

          USING THE COMPUFON

          Hotkey-ing into COMPUFON is as easy as ALT-right-SHIFT.
          The COMPUFON window will pop-up.  You'll see that the
          directory is divided into a series of records, each divided
          into three fields: one for names, one for COMPANY names, and
          one for numbers.  The record which becomes highlighted
          by the program bar is the CURRENT RECORD. Press <enter>
          and COMPUFON will dial that highlighted number. Easy!

          A menu line across the bottom of the window assigns
          function keys.  F1 calls up the program setup and allows
          you to configure COMPUFON for your COM port.  F2 pops
          up a 'search' window, where you can enter a name
          to be searched for in the directory.

          F3, or 'next', moves to the next record. F4 installs
          a blank record - for adding a new name/number - above
          the current record.  F5 deletes the current record.
          F6 pastes the last record you deleted into the
          current record database position. F7 saves the
          current database to the disk so you can recall it
          later and F8 pops up a window which allows you to
          load a COMPUFON datafile into memory.

          The first thing you'll want to do with COMPUFON
          is enter a few names and numbers.  Pop up
          COMPUFON and strike the Tab key.  The cursor
          will appear in the 'Names' field. Type
          a name.  Then hit <Tab>.  Now the cursor
          will be in the 'Company' field.  Type
          in the company name.  Move back by
          pressing Shift-Tab.  When you've typed
          your record, press <enter>.  The typed
          data will be entered into the database
          and the cursor will go away.

          All the directional keys on your keyboard will
          allow you to maneuver around the field as long
          as the cursor is active, too.

          Editing a record is as easy as moving the
          highlight bar with the up/down arrows, striking
          <Tab> to activate the cursor, and typing in 
          the desired changes.  If you goof up, hit
          <Escape> and your changes will be erased.
          If there is not enough memory left for 
          another entry, COMPUFON will politely
          remind you that this is so.

          After you enter your names and numbers, you'll
          want to save them.  Press F7. COMPUFON will
          ask you to name a file in which they are to
          be saved.  To load a file you've already
          saved, press F8.  COMPUFON will ask you
          for the name of the file and load it.

          Now it's time to dial a number!  Highlight
          a number you'd like to dial.  Press
          the <enter> key.  By default, COMPUFON
          will work with any Hayes or Hayes-compatible
          modem connected to COM port 1.  The default
          speed is 2400 bps.  If this description
          doesn't fit your machine, you can alter
          the configuration from the setup
          window accessed by striking F1.

          After COMPUFON transmits the command to
          dial to your modem, it pops up a window
          that tells you to wait until the dialed
          phone begins to ring, and then pick up the
          handset and press any key to disconnect
          the modem from the line.  Pick up the
          telephone BEFORE you press a key.  If
          you don't, you'll lose the connection and
          have to start over.


          CUSTOMIZING COMPUFON FOR YOUR MODEM

          If your modem isn't Hayes compatible,
          you can make changes to COMPUFON's
          default set-up.  

          Pop up the set-up window with F1.
          From this console, you can change eight
          parameters. You can move through
          the parameters with the Up and Down
          arrows. Move the red 'highlighting'
          bar over the setting you wish to adjust.
          For example, with "COM port" highlighted,
          you can space bar through COM1, COM2,
          COM3 or COM4. With "Communications
          settings" highlighted, you can select from
          data rates ranging from 300-9600 baud and
          two different data formats: N81 and E71.

          Pressing <enter>, <Tab> or the space bar
          for any other highlighted line brings
          up the cursor and allows you to enter
          text.  For example, if there
          are any digits you want COMPUFON to
          dial BEFORE dialing the phone (like 9
          for an outside line), enter them into
          "Dialing Prefix" at the bottom of
          the window.  If every number you
          dial is long distance, enter 1.
          If you need the modem to pause after
          dialing prefixes, add a comma or two
          after the numbers.

          When you've made all the changes necessary,
          press Esc to exit.  COMPUFON will prompt
          you as to whether you want to save
          the changes to the disk.  If you answer
          no, COMPUFON will use them only for the
          duration of the session and then revert to its
          defaults.  If you answer yes, you'll have to
          enter the name of a file to save the address
          TO. Enter the name and location of CMPUFON.COM.
          For example, if CMPUFON.COM is in the FONE
          directory on the C: drive, answer C:\FONE\CMPUFON.COM
          COMPUFON will copy the new defaults to its
          image on disk so that the next time it loads,
          your changes will automatically take effect.
