	 RUNNING THIS PROGRAM:
	      Basically, this program looks like DOS, and acts the same.
For info on how to install please refer to the installation section. Remember, 
this file can cause alot of trouble. My friend, Ryan, and I took it to a local 
computer show, and it caused havok. The first time they ran it they rebooted, 
then after the first reboot, they thought that there was something wrong with 
the drives (It says Incorrect drive specifcation...). They then proceeded to 
rip the computer apart. Remember, this file is not the cause of the troule, 
you are. To exit the program, simply type "EXIT".

	 INSTALLATION: 
	      ViruDos is just run from the normal C:\> prompt or the like. In
futher versions of ViruDos, we plan to have the program be self-destructive. 
We tried this in this version but ran into major problems, so maybe next 
version. PLEASE look for futher versions of this program.

	FURTHER VERSIONS:
	     ViruDos and Snail SoftWare are planning to come out with ViruDRDos. 
For those of you, like me, that have pals that use DRDOS. This version will be 
available faster for the paid subscibers.

	 WHILE RUNNING VIRUDOS:
	      While in ViruDos, the program runs basically the same as MS-DOS.
Some options have been deleted, to give the impression that a virus is present.
During the program an ANSI screen should pop up every once in a while, this is
supposed to represent a virus screen. Music will also play. We hope that you 
enjoy this software, and hope to see you using more of Snail products.

	SUBSCRIBING:
	      If you are interested in subscription, and want to support two
starving programmers, call the above BBS and leave either Johnny Disco, or Frog
E-Mail. We will put you on our mailing list and give you the current version 
of our program. Thank you for supporting us.
