	What is the Crypt Newsletter?  The Crypt Newsletter is an electronic
	document which delivers deft satire, savage criticism and media
	analyses on topics of interest to the editor and the computing
	public.  The Crypt Newsletter also reviews anti-virus and
	security software and republishes digested news of note to
	users of such.  The Crypt Newsletter ALSO supplies analysis and
	complete source code to many computer viruses made expressly for
	the newsletter. Source codes and DEBUG scripts of these viruses
	can corrupt - quickly and irreversibly - the data on an
	IBM-compatible microcomputer - particularly when handled foolishly
	by individuals who consider high school algebra "puzzling."

	OKIE CITY WHITE-COLLAR WORKERS INSTALL PORN LOADERS, NOT VIRUSES,
	ON NETWORK or "HOW NOT TO HANDLE PC SECURITY ISSUES" by MAX SPEEGLE

	Max Speegle of Edmond City, Oklahoma - a suburb of Oklahoma City -
	was out to find some viruses on the city hall network he managed.
	Instead, he found some of that knob-stroking stuff.

	He reacted . . . poorly.

	"The basic problem is that we've all got these computers," he said
	to an Edmond Evening Sun reporter at the beginning of April.
	"[They] are linked together on a network.  A computer virus could
	disable the entire system.

	"And the city of Edmond could be liable of violating copyright
	laws if it were found to have unregistered software in its
	computer system," added Speegle.

	According to Speegle, "a porno program" was discovered by the
	city's "computer diagnostic experts" while checking for
	"viruses."  However, no viruses were uncovered.

	Speegle then did exactly the worst thing possible from a
	security standpoint.  He conducted a "pretermination"
	(American euphemism for "firing") hearing for six traffic
	control department employees, on whose PC's the porn loader
	was found.

	The hearing was fruitless. No person or city employee
	would admit to bringing in the porn loader, or even
	imply that they knew who did.

	"It's hard to tell where it came from," mumbled the
	hapless Speegle.

	The Crypt Newsletter hopes its readers never get to work
	as data systems engineers for someone like Max.
	In one deft stroke, Max ensured that even if an
	employee found a virus on his workplace PC in the future,
	he would never report it, logically fearing professional
	doom in the inevitable "investigation."

	While not advocating the free use of animations of young
	women fornicating with small donkeys, The
	Crypt Newsletter warns its readers in the security
	field - even the most sclerotic and corporate - that
	giving non-technical employees even the slightest impression
	they will be booted for software irregularities goes far
	to assure the successful spread of a virus on your network.

	NCSA PROCLAIMS NATIONAL COMPUTER VIRUS AWARENESS DAY

	On June 9 the National Computer Security Association will
	celebrate Computer Virus Awareness Day.

	In a press release the organization said it hoped a national
	Computer Virus Awareness Day will encourage federal protection of
	the Clinton administration's proposed "data
	superhighway."

	The NCSA will brief Congress about the virus threat and
	recommended action.

	In an additional move, during the week of June 7, the
	House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee of the Energy and
	Commerce Committee, is expected to hold hearings on information
	security and solicit public comment on possible
	anti-virus legislation.

	Robert Bales, executive director of the Carslisle, PA,
	based NCSA said, " . . . we're working with lawmakers to establish
	an appropriate federal response to virus propagation."

	Strong anti-virus legislation has been proposed before, most
	notably by Congressman Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) in 1991.  Such
	measures have a history of going nowhere, probably due to
	complexities not easily explained in reassuring corporate-mumble
	to your typical techno-idiot U.S. politician.

	INTRODUCING ***ASK MR. BADGER!*** AN OCCASIONAL COLUMN BY
	ROVING CRYPT NEWSLETTER MEDIA CRITIC, MR. RAOUL BADGER!!

	Dear Mr. Raoul Badger,

	I just bought the latest issue of MONDO 2000 to see how it
	compared with the MONDO 2000 USER's GUIDE.  Whew. What
	a lot of [unprintable].  Is it always so, um, artistic?

					 --Thornton Bloor

	Yes, Thornton, good observation.  But here's what you do.
	Go into the store.  Buy copies of MONDO 2000 and HUSTLER.
	Fold the MONDO 2000 and put it inside your copy of
	HUSTLER before you leave the store.  This will protect
	you from any possible embarrassment.

					 --Raoul Badger

	Bloor's whining letter reminded me that, as always, it's
	never too late to criticize the latest techno-babble.
	As you must have seen, a recent TIME had a cover story
	on the wonderful new computer/cable/television system
	which will restore the purity of American children,
	return the manly vigor to septuagenarian grandfathers
	and replace The Hair Club for Men.  Lame. Extremely
	lame.  Where do they find these reporters?

	Well, not too much later - April 16 - L.A Times Sunday
	Magazine ran a cover story on the wonderful new
	computer/cable/television system which will restore
	the purity of American children, return the manly vigor
	to septuagenarian grandfathers, replace The Hair Club
	for Men AND generate a bunch of television miniseries
	even more mind-rotting than "Wild Palms."  Lame.
	Extremely lame.  Am I repeating myself?  Why is that,
	do you suppose.  Too much Mimizine!

	Also, you won't want to miss the latest High Times
	(bought for information purposes only, I swear!)
	which asks if this generation's technoids all belong to
	LSD.  In a stunning display of drug-induced short-term
	memory loss, the reporters forget to answer the question.
	Lame. Extremely lame.

	And the latest Playboy (bought for the stories only, I
	swear!) contains an article profiling a self-proclaimed
	"privacy thief."

	As Mr. Sherlock Holmes would say:

	   "Interesting what the article has to say about computer
	   crime."

	   Dr. Watson:  "But it says nothing about computer crime!"

	   Holmes:  "Exactly!"

	Here's a guy who makes his living collecting "private" information
	and what are his sources?  People.  Computer operators, telephone
	operators, bank loan officers, etc.  We see again that the
	real weak link in the information society Albert Gore masturbates
	to isn't computers or hackers.  It's the poorly trained employees
	of the organizations which own the system.  Mr. Average American
	will read about the invasion of his privacy - want to take any
	bets on his missing the point?

	So, until next time, remember the words the bandito hurled at
	Humphrey Bogart in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madres".

	  "We don' NEED no STEENKING Badgers!"

	Hmmph.

				     An 'in-tents' summer congress



   H U H?
  -------

Remember the Galactic Hacker Party back in 1989? Ever wondered what
happened to the people behind it? We sold out to big business, you
think. Think again, we're back!

That's right. On august 4th, 5th and 6th 1993, we're organising a
three-day summer congress for hackers, phone phreaks, programmers,
computer haters, data travellers, electro-wizards, networkers, hardware
freaks, techno-anarchists, communications junkies, cyberpunks, system
managers, stupid users, paranoid androids, Unix gurus, whizz kids, warez
dudes, law enforcement officers (appropriate undercover dress required),
guerilla heating engineers and other assorted bald, long-haired and/or
unshaven scum. And all this in the middle of nowhere (well, the middle
of Holland, actually, but that's the same thing) at the Larserbos
campground four metres below sea level.

The three days will be filled with lectures, discussions and workshops
on hacking, phreaking, people's networks, Unix security risks, virtual
reality, semafun, social engineering, magstrips, lockpicking,
viruses, paranoia, legal sanctions against hacking in Holland and
elsewhere and much, much more. English will be the lingua franca for
this event, although some workshops may take place in Dutch. There
will be an Internet connection, an intertent ethernet and social
interaction (both electronic and live). Included in the price are four
nights in your own tent. Also included are inspiration, transpiration,
a shortage of showers (but a lake to swim in), good weather
(guaranteed by god), campfires and plenty of wide open space and fresh
air. All of this for only 100 dutch guilders (currently around US$70).

We will also arrange for the availability of food, drink and smokes of
assorted types, but this is not included in the price. Our bar will be
open 24 hours a day, as well as a guarded depository for valuables
(like laptops, cameras etc.). You may even get your stuff back! For
people with no tent or air mattress: you can buy a tent through us for
100 guilders, a mattress costs 10 guilders. You can arrive from 17:00
(that's five p.m. for analogue types) on August 3rd. We don't have to
vacate the premises until 12:00 noon on Saturday, August 7 so you can
even try to sleep through the devastating Party at the End of Time
(PET) on the closing night (live music provided). We will arrange for
shuttle buses to and from train stations in the vicinity.


H O W ?
-------

Payment: In advance only. Even poor techno-freaks like us would like
to get to the Bahamas at least once, and if enough cash comes in we
may just decide to go. So pay today, or tomorrow, or yesterday, or in
any case before Friday, June 25th 1993. Since the banks still haven't
figured out why the Any key doesn't work for private international
money transfers, you should call, fax or e-mail us for the best way to
launder your currency into our account. We accept American Express,
even if they do not accept us. But we are more understanding than they
are. Foreign cheques go directly into the toilet paper recycling bin
for the summer camp, which is about all they're good for here.


H A !
-----

Very Important: Bring many guitars and laptops.


M E ?
-----

Yes, you! Busloads of alternative techno-freaks from all over the
planet will descend on this event. You wouldn't want to miss that,
now, would you?

Maybe you are part of that select group that has something special to
offer! Participating in 'Hacking at the End of the Universe' is
exciting, but organising your very own part of it is even more fun. We
already have a load of interesting workshops and lectures scheduled,
but we're always on the lookout for more. We're also still in the
market for people who want to help us organize this during the
congress.

In whatever way you wish to participate, call, write, e-mail or fax us
soon, and make sure your money gets here on time. Space is limited.

	VIRTUALLY NO REALITY: IN THE READING ROOM WITH THE USUAL
	GOBBLE
	--------------------------------------------------------------

	"Virtual reality. What a concept."

	Yup, we kid you not - that's the lead to the June Popular Science's
	cover story on the buzz-concept of 1993.

	But what concept does the story deliver?  None, except
	more phlogiston and shopworn photos on Virtuality's
	Dactyl Nightmare game - the same press-release photos and
	animations that, uh, you've already read in TIME, OMNI, MONDO
	2000, OMNI, WIRED, MONDO 2000, NEWSWEEK, TIME and POPULAR SCIENCE.
	Is there an echo in here?

	And THEN reporter Michael Antonoff burbles about the exciting
	new SEGA "virtual reality" helmet which is about to
	pop off the assembly line. It will replace the
	TV with the usual goofy-looking, Nazi-helmet which
	the company brags, will deliver a "feeling of total
	immersion in a completely realistic 360-degree game
	world."  That's if you consider SEGA games realistic,
	of course.

	Next comes the Virtual Kitchen, we are told.  Why, you'll
	even be able to turn on the faucet and listen to running
	water.  Wow.  We're really pushing the boundaries of
	science, now.

	And there's virtual skiing as a possibity, writes Antonoff.
	You won't really learn how to ski, but it will be fun.

	The story wraps up with 30 socko column inches on the usual
	wild speculation on "Virtual Reality" applications
	in everything from medicine to alchemy.  Much of this talk
	is reminiscent of the inflated claims which surrounded the
	science of molecular genetics in the mid-'80's and persists
	to this day.  Molecular biology was going to cure
	cancer, eliminate viral and inherited illness and provide
	everything from miracle drugs to custom-made enzymes which
	would eliminate the threat of oil spills while replacing The
	Hair Club for Men.

	It was bullshit then and it's bullshit now. The theories
	are nice, but nature doesn't yield her secrets easily
	just because science/entertainment reporters have
	decided to be flacks for newly minted professaurus's
	seeking tenure and grant money.

	Of course, molecular biology HAS provided a key to understanding
	cellular mechanisms at a very low level. However,
	it hasn't set the world on edge.  Despite superhuman
	effort, diseases like malaria, although well understood,
	aren't playing dead.

	And we suspect, so it will be with "virtual reality."  A
	lot of idiots will throw a ton of money at it and they'll
	get what they already have: games and sex toys.

	Even the tabloid TV journalists of the salacious "Hard
	Copy" sneered at the "Virtual Reality" mavens on a
	recent evening segment.  A couple of women, whose
	names we forget, bleated on about "virtual sex" and
	wound up showing Darth Vader-style helmets, rushes
	from "The Lawnmower Man"  and the kind of animations
	which tipped over Max Speegle's apple cart. Crypt editors
	couldn't help jeering along with the "Hard Copy" anchormen
	at the oh-so-novel idea of attaching  "data gloves" to the
	schlong.  (Actually, such tools have been around for a long
	time.  You find them listed under "Penisator" in magazines
	published by Larry Flynt.)

	Indeed, if you think a minute you realize there is no such
	thing as "virtual sex".  It's like being "slightly
	pregnant."  Or having a "minor" case of gonorrhea. You either
	have sex with another person, skin to skin, or you don't.
	"Virtual sex" is just another fluffy, meaningless
	euphemism for computerized team masturbation. The Crypt Newsletter
	supports the use of "virtual hooker" or "virtual love automaton"
	if you must have jargon; the latter is better, particularly if
	you're in  need of some reassuring corporate-mumble for conning
	a roomful of investment bankers.

	The mind reels at the possibilities.  Imagine the Michelangelo
	virus, or some descendant of it, activating on Ted and Alice's
	Virtual Sex PC, crashing the system and causing a "virtual"
	convulsion in their "data gloves" just as they're booting up
	for some afternoon delight.  Ouch. Lawsuit.

	So the next time someone mentions the word "virtual" to you
	in dinner conversation, gracefully dump your side-plate of
	collard greens into their lap.

	[And, lo, just as this issue of the Crypt Newsletter went to the
	electronic press Newsweek magazine trumped Popular Science
	with a cover story on "interactive" - that curious admixture
	of virtual reality, information superhighways and CD-ROM
	squeaking/talking books.  "Virtual reality," claimed the magazine,
	". . . with a mighty computer and New Age goggles . . . you'll
	eventually be able to simulate sex, drugs, rock and roll and
	just about every other human activity."  Even sicking
	up on your date after a night of too many Long Island Iced
	Teas?

       IN THE READING ROOM II: TECHNICAL STUFF
       ---------------------------------------------------------------


       The May 1993 issue of IEEE Spectrum contains an interesting
       article on computer viruses called "Computers and Epidemiology."
       Researched by Jeffrey Kephart, Steve White and David Chess of
       IBM, the piece attempts to create a mathematical epidemiological
       model to explain computer virus spread.

       Kephart and his co-authors link old research on
       smallpox and cholera into the story, intimating that computer
       virus epidemiology has its parallels with such. The evidence is
       thin and unconvincing, mostly because the authors appeared to rely on
       National Geographic magazine and a general account called
       "Plagues and Peoples" by William McNeill.  They also cite
       "The Mathematical Theory of Infectious Diseases" by Norman
       Bailey, but it's my hunch they restrict most of their discussion
       to very light information abstracted from the first two
       references.

       In any case, Kephart, et al., simulated computer virus
       spread.  Using three different modes, assuming homogenous, 2-D
       lattice and hierarchical spread, they plot their results and
       come up with graphs that . . . really don't closely fit any
       computer virus "plagues." This appears to have two explanations:
       1) Valid epidemiological data on computer virus outbreaks
       is much harder to come by than data from human disease; and 2)
       there is a "human" element present in computer virus infections
       that is difficult, if not impossible, to model precisely.

       Hmmmm. Although the alert Crypt Newsletter reader no doubt
       suspects this already, now that an almost general audience
       engineering journal has committed it to paper, some of the
       usual clouds of hysteria which surround computer virus infection
       may finally blow away.

       The authors conclude by constructing a topology which governs
       computer virus spread and draw a colored, interlocking lattice
       to illustrate what they mean.  It makes sense when you see
       it, but it's drawn only from simulation, not empirical results.

       Also supplied by the piece is some graphical data on common
       virus incidence, presented a lot more solidly than the pie
       charts and what-not usually found in glossy "suit" computer
       publications.  Form virus, it shows, passed Stoned as the
       most common reported infection in 1992.

       The article boxes out the quote: "A popular but misleading
       theory of virus replication would have one quarter of the
       world's 100 million PC's already infected."  The reader
       may recall that the silly pop-science book, "Approaching
       Zero" tried to sell that same theory to the general public.

       ------------------------------------------------------------

       The recent issue of Mark Ludwig's Computer Virus Developments
       Quarterly deals almost exclusively with mutation engines.
       Ludwig examines the original MtE and tests some current
       scanners against a number of demo viruses utilizing it.
       Not surprisingly, all the anti-virus software tested detects the
       original Sara-MtE virus included with the Dark Avenger's
       object file.  More shocking are the results when Ludwig does
       some minor twiddling with code located in the engine's variable
       decryptor.  Suddenly the demo viruses become completely
       invisible to the current versions of SCAN, Central Point

       THE NEW REPUBLIC GETS ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY . . . AND
       PROMPTLY GETS A SPEEDING TICKET FROM RAOUL BADGER
       ----------------------------------------------------------------

       The May 24 New Republic has a cover story on Mitch Kapor, Data
       Highway Guru (as they've christened him).  It asks the burning
       questions:

	       Has Kapor sold out?
	       Has EFF eliminated all other input into the brave, new
		       cybernetwork?
	       Will ISDN be obsolete by the time anyone uses it?
	       Should we trust the cable companies with the brave, new
		       cybernetwork?
	       Should we trust the Baby Bells?
	       Should we trust the government?
	       Should we trust the free market?
	       Will American culture survive?
	       Will the whole thing end in gridlock?
	       Will the whole thing end in anarchy?

       Yawn.  While it has a good representation of the present status of a
       nationwide data highway (highways built, no exit/entrance ramps yet).
       and a reasonable prediction of what it would be like under cable
       companies or the Bells, the further the author gets from Kapor's
       present political views, the worse it gets.

       Once again EFF turns out to be

	       "a public interest group devoted to defending the civil
		liberties of hackers.  (Some were getting stifling attention
		from, for example, federal agents who didn't see the humor
		in entering government or corporate computers, even if just
		for kicks.)"

       Sigh.   It turns out Kapor is "the more authentic embodiment of
       Silicon Valley's hacker ideals:  anti-corporate, nonconformist,
       vaguely whole-earthish, creative."

       Of course, there is the computerized artwork that is now mandatory
       for any article containing the prefix "cyber" more than once. (It's a
       law, I believe).  Yawn.  Of course, we have the standard references to
       the past to explain the future, although using Thomas Jefferson was
       a unique twist. (Hey, it beats the heck out of a quote from Timothy
       Leary comparing LSD to the local BBS).  Yawn (again).  All in all,
       there's better analysis in the local horoscope section of
       your newspaper.

      MAKING SPAWNERS LESS HUNGRY by Crom-Cruach, TridenT

      In this article, I'll describe a method to avoid memory gaps with
      spawning viruses, hereby named <???>. I assume you're familiar with
      the DOS interrupts and memory usage.

      Spawning viruses are my personal favorite. For those unfamiliar
      with them, I will briefly describe the basic idea
      (for COM->EXE spawners).

      DOS searches for executables in the sequence COM, EXE, BAT. The
      virus infects EXE-files by creating a COM-file with the same
      filename containing the virus. When the user executes <filename>,
      the COM-file will be executed. The virus installs itself in memory
      (or infects other EXE-files directly), frees available memory above
      itself, executes the original EXE-file and terminates itself. Memory
      allocation looks like this (not scaled):

			 +-[0:0]-------------------+
			 |                         |
			 | BIOS                    |
			 | DOS                     |
			 | (Resident programs)     |
			 |                         |
			 +=[Environment MCB]=======+
			 !                         !
			 ! Virus environment table !
			 !                         !

			 ! Virus code              !
			 ! Virus stack             !
			 !                         !
			 +=========================+
			 |                         |
			 | [Free for program]      |
			 |                         |
			 +-[Top available memory]--+
			 |                         |
			 | (Allocated top-memory)  |
			 |                         |
			 +-------------------------+

      In general, this method will work fine. However, if the host will stay
      resident, the virus will leave a nasty memory gap at its position after
      terminating.

      So, how can we avoid this? The virus (or at least, the termination
      routine) and the stack space must be moved to the top of available
      memory (which must be allocated, of course), and the low-memory
      original must be freed.

      Doing it that simple, however, will just crash the system. DOS can't
      find the active PSP and (thus) the environment table. We'll have to
      copy these as well.

      Next, DOS must know where to find the copies of both. The environment
      segment can easily be set by setting it in the PSP copy at offset 2Ch.
      The PSP copy can be activated by the function Microsoft especially
      designed for us (well, maybe not ;) the undocumented Function. 50h/Int.
      21h (BX=segment).

      Note that the copied MCBs will still be owned by the freed PSP segment!
      Instead, you can set it to 0008 (DOS), which will look inconspicuous to
      infected memory map programs. After execution of the infected program,
      you must free the segments by either setting its owner to the PSP-copy,
      or with Fct. 49h/Int 21h (only the environment segment!).

      The new scheme, then:

    The included program, Weirdo, uses this technique. It's a beta, I didn't
    thoroughly test it, and it doesn't do anything at the moment. It remains
    resident in EMS, with a loader in the batch control block of AUTOEXEC.BAT
    (if both available, of course).

    CAREER OF EVIL: SIMPLE STEALTH AND INFECT ON OPEN . . . PLUS A FEW
    COMMENTS
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    CAREER OF EVIL virus, included in this issue, is a memory resident
    appending infector of .COM files which uses a very common technique
    for spoofing the file size of infected programs when the virus is
    in memory.

    By installing its own directory handler, the virus quickly subtracts
    its file size from information contained in the file control block
    structure whenever the user calls a "dir" function.

    This stunt has become extremely common in memory resident infectors;
    good examples of old code first appeared in the NuKE InfoJournal's
    NPox viruses about a year ago.

    Taking a look at the virus source code, you'll see Career of Evil
    simply nets DOS functions 11h and 12h and passes them through a
    short handler before returning control to the user. The virus
    recognizes infected files from information also contained in the
    file control block - seconds data from the time/date stamp.
    This data is never shown to the user, so it can be set to anything,
    for example, any peculiar value which the virus will recognize.
    In this case, Career of Evil sets it to 31.

    Because this is such a simple stealth measure, it's easy to
    overcome.  The simple DOS program, FC, is not dependent upon
    the directory functions and can compare two files and flag
    differences in content.  It will do this even when a virus like
    Career of Evil is in memory.  Many marginal/intermediate stealth
    viruses can be exposed in this manner.  Early versions of NPox and
    a number of ARCV memory resident viruses are good examples.  If
    you have copies, you can test it yourself.  Simply infect one
    copy of duplicate files with the virus.  Then:

	 FC <file1> <file2>

    You'll quickly see the difference even when the virus is in
    memory.

    This trick becomes complicated when a memory resident virus infects
    on file open, like Career of Evil.  By trapping DOS Int 21
    function, 03Dh (open) calls, as well as the standard file load, the
    virus multiplies its infection rate. Now try the same test using FC.
    Career of Evil will quickly add itself to the uninfected file when
    FC opens it.

    This goes further.  If you use any program which opens .COM files
    during operation, Career of Evil will infect all of them
    instantly.  Try this with your favorite anti-virus
    scanner.  Put Career of Evil into memory and scan a set of uncontaminated
    executables.  You'll find when you're done that the virus has
    added itself to every one.

    It is critical then, that your anti-virus program refuse to run
    when it finds a virus of this nature in memory.  Perhaps you might
    like to try that experiment with an older virus which infects
    on open.

    Because of this Career of Evil is very infectious.  It will quickly
    get into the command processor and then infect almost every .COM file
    it can on an average machine.

    There is one point that is a subtle one. Career of Evil will only infect
    files with a jump at their beginning.  Why?  Take the instruction
    where Career of Evil checks for 0E9h out, reassemble and run.  Start
    computing and you'll find the virus quickly hangs the machine.  You see,
    everytime a complex .EXE fires up and loads or opens a data or help file,
    a virus of this nature will try to add itself to this non-program,
    usually with bad result.

    Many memory resident viruses have this flaw.  An easy way to test
    for it is to put the virus in question into memory, infect COMMAND.COM and
    reboot the machine.  Assuming the virus does not derange the command
    processor, the machine will boot, the virus will load itself and
    then try to infect the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  The result will be a
    series of error messages generated by binary code added by the virus
    to the end of the file.  This is much more common than you might
    think and it ensures that any memory resident virus which
    does not scrupulously screen opened or loaded files for non-executable
    data will quickly crash a machine during normal computing. And
    it's probably one reason why so many memory resident viruses don't
    spread very well in the wild, even though they look very infectious
    at a glance.

    There are a number of ways around this. Some virus groups like to
    make their virus check extents, like .COM or .EXE.  We made
    Career of Evil check for a jump at the beginning of opened or
    loaded files before proceeding.  While some .COMfiles won't be
    infected, on our office machines about 90% were, including
    COMMAND.COM - which is the whole ballgame.

    In addition, there is a beta copy of Career of Evil which
    contains a routine to test for Microsoft Anti-virus's VSAFE
    memory resident system monitor.  The routine deinstalls
    VSAFE, allowing the virus to become resident without warning.
    The original source code by programmer Willoughby is included.
    It's interesting and well commented with the logic behind it
    simple to follow.  Willoughby notes that it is remarkable
    that Central Point Software and, by extension, Microsoft
    have chosen to handle their anti-virus software in this manner.
    It's a clever observation and we think you'll agree with
    his conclusions.

    You can make a demonstrator of Willoughby's code
    by assembling with the A86 assembler.  It is this routine which
    has been included in the extra copy of Career of Evil.

    Willoughby's anti-monitor routine is version specific with
    respect to Central Point Anti-virus's VSAFE utility and we
    give him profuse thanks for distributing it in the public
    domain.

    END NOTES: the Weirdo program is a demonstrator. For best effect,
    put it into a directory with a common .EXE file like DOS's
    DEBUG.  Rename Weirdo to DEBUG.COM and execute.  DEBUG will
    come up, but Weirdo will have gone into high memory.  You can
    then worry over your memory map and see if you can easily find
    Weirdo.  One good tool is Patrick Toulme's FULLVIEW.  You can
    test Crom-Cruach's program by duplicating the experiment
    with some programs that remain resident.  The source code
    for Weirdo isn't included because the program is not infectious and
    Crom-Cruach forgot to send it to us. <g>

    Viruses like Career of Evil are supplied as DEBUG scripts and
    source files.  If you don't have the A86 assembler which is needed
    to turn the Career of Evil source listing into a live virus, you can
    manufacture a working copy of the program by simply
    putting the scriptfile in the same directory as DOS's DEBUG.EXE
    and typing:

		  DEBUG <caroevil.scr


    The same applies for any other scriptfiles supplied with the
    newsletter.

    Keep in mind that viruses included in the newsletter have little
    practical use other than replicating.  In the process they will
    likely trash a great deal of your data, sometimes even when you
    think you know what you're doing.

    "A fool and his money soon go different ways" is the old saw;
    so it is with computer viruses.
