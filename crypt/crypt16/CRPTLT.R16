	-=The first section of this month's newsletter is dedicated
	to the news events surrounding the break up of the hacker files
	library on the U.S. Bureau of Public Debt's Security Branch
	BBS in Parkersburg, WVa.=-

	THE SORROW AND THE PITY:  THE NAKED TRUTH TAKES IT ON THE CHIN
	AT AIS

	Early this month, the only professional security bulletin
	board system run by the U.S. government worth visiting was
	gutshot, the victim of a mounting campaign of
	innuendo and anonymous gossip implying that it aided computer
	criminals by granting easy access to virus source code and
	dangerous hacker tools.

	Profiled initially almost a year ago in Computer underground
	Digest, the AIS BBS, run by Public Debt security branch team
	leader Kim Clancy, the system was trumpeted as a place
	where security professionals and interested parties could come
	to get the unvarnished truth about hacking, computer intrusion
	and virus infection.  It delivered on the promise and more as
	sysop Clancy amassed a truly comprehensive collection of
	hacker files, including a basic library of commented virus
	source code.

	The BBS was grandly successful, amassing over 1,000 registered
	users who came as professionals, hackers, and curiosity seekers.

	But the distribution of hacker files and virus code was a
	controversial idea, one which did not sit well with an "old-boy"
	network of security professionals and anti-virus researchers and
	software developers who comprise a loose professional/pan-
	professional organization known as CARO, or the Computer Antivirus
	Research Organization.

	After the Crypt Newsletter profiled Clancy in February of this
	year, CARO member and Englishman Alan Solomon, Ph.D., the
	developer of Dr. Solomon's Antivirus Toolkit took the opportunity
	to jawbone a captive audience on the impropriety of virus source
	code on AIS at a meeting of security professionals in NYC in
	March.

	Also disturbed was Ken van Wyk, the moderator of Virus-L-Digest,
	a weekly electronic mail collection distributed on the
	INTERNET/USENET and dominated by the technical babble, gossip and
	apocrypha of CARO members like Bulgarian researcher Vesselin
	Bontchev and software developer Frisk Skulason.  None of this,
	said Clancy, made any difference.  After all, the ramblings
	of electronic mail digests - rantings in the vast electronic
	ether of cyberspace are, generally, not taken seriously by
	the vast majority of computer users who read them; they are
	just part of the background radiation that everyone is used to.
	Wyk's concern, she said, was just more of the same:  inaccurate
	and technically silly complaints which had dogged the BBS
	intermittently since its inception.

	But like a miraculous silver bullet in a storm of wild, ineffectual
	buckshot, one anonymous letter finally undid all of Clancy's
	work. Published in RISKS, another electronic mail forum originating
	from SRI, an organization of computer security providers based in
	the Silicon Valley, the letter, written by "anonymous" accused the
	AIS BBS of distributing material that was illegal and unethical.

	"Anonymous" was immediately labelled a catspaw of Alan Solomon,
	a tattletale, a squealer with a hidden agenda according to
	Crypt sources in the computer security community, hardly the
	government "whistleblower" portrayed by the The Washington Post
	when the story broke nationwide on June 19.  In reality, "anonymous"
	was Paul Ferguson, a Centreville native and obscure security
	consultant and anti-virus software developer.  The Washington
	Post stumbled badly in its presentation of the facts, choosing
	not to tell readers, if indeed it even knew, that Ferguson
	was "anonymous," portraying him as independent, unbiased supporting
	testimony. Ferguson played his double-role on the pages
	of The Washington Post to the max, pontificating on the dangers
	of leaving virus code and hacker tools on a government BBS
	where anyone could see and download them.  "That's like
	leaving a loaded gun around and people saying, 'It's not
	my fault if someone picks it up and shoots himself in the
	head with it,'" he said.

	Ferguson had polished this act by pulling the same
	"gild the lily" stunt in RISKS a few weeks earlier.
	RISKS editor Peter Neumann published a Ferguson letter in support
	of "anonymous"'s "whistleblowing," neglecting to inform readers
	that Ferguson was the same man.  Interestingly, Neumann
	chose not to publish any letters in support of Clancy and AIS
	including one submitted by Frank Tirado, a USDA security
	administrator. The Post also interviewed Neumann, who chose not
	to inform reporter Joel Garreau, if indeed he knew himself, that
	Ferguson and "anonymous" were the same.

	Also unknown to reporters in the mainstream media, Ferguson
	was no stranger to underground "virus exchange" bulletin
	board systems which he would occasionally access to gather
	virus tools.  John Buchanan, the sysop of a Newport News/Virginia
	Beach-based "Black Axis BBS", self-proclaimed as the "largest
	virus exchange in the world" remembers Ferguson calling
	him for virus code.  "He wanted the Trident Polymorphic
	Engine because he couldn't find it anywhere else.  He pleaded
	for it, so I gave it to him," said Buchanan in an interview
	with the Crypt Newsletter about two months ago.
	[The Trident Polymorphic Engine is a virus tool, inspired by
	the Dark Avenger Mutation Engine, which confers complex, variable
	encryption to any virus using it, often making the virus
	transparent to conventional brute force anti-virus scanning
	tools restricted to a simple, now obsolete "algorithmic"
	approach.]

	This seemed contorted, hypocritical behavior from a man secretly
	lobbying, along with CARO members Alan Solomon and Frisk
	Skulason, for the removal of the AIS BBS's virus code library,
	a code library much less complete than Buchanan's Black Axis
	but much more accessible to relatively straightforward security
	workers hesitant to dive into the deep, uncharted pools of
	source code and live files found on many underground systems.
	Also lost in the hysteria was the obscure fact that CARO members
	had already helped themselves to virus source code on AIS.

	However, at the end of April, weeks after Ferguson's e-mail
	sleight of hand had been played out in RISKS, AIS still
	had its reputation.  It took a serendipitous fax from the
	House's Committee on Space, Technology and Science requesting
	a copy of the RISKS issue in question to panic bureaucrats
	above Clancy at the Bureau of Public Debt.  Although the
	requestor was never identified and no follow-up ensued, managers
	worried that the sky was falling - surely a congressional
	investigation was imminent.

	Calling a meeting to discuss the future of AIS BBS, managers thrust
	aside arguments that removing the hacker files and code from
	the BBS would only shoot security workers in the foot, depriving
	the less-experienced among them of a source of code and techniques
	already widely available throughout the U.S. to any 15-year old
	with a modem and a minimal understanding of the word 'BBS'ing.'

	All the hacker files were subsequently removed from AIS BBS
	and there were no further developments until the story
	broke in the national press on June 19.  Associated Press
	sent it around the world with a savagely inaccurate lead
	proclaiming the bulletin board system had aided computer vandals.

	Where this fabrication came from is uncertain; what was
	certain was that Kim Clancy's reputation was toast, thrown
	into the barnyard muck and trampled by anti-virus software
	developer-manipulated rabble from the newsmedia too easily
	convinced that an out-of-control government agency had been
	subverted by hackers into working for the forces of darkness.

	What was not covered in the press were questions establishing
	the professional connections between its "expert sources"
	and the double duty Ferguson was allowed to serve as
	anonymous whistleblower"  and security expert/public good
	watchdog. Nor was there was any mention of the bald-faced
	cronyism required in the anti-virus/security
	community so that Ferguson could plant himself at RISKS
	and The Post with unblemished credibility.

	Clancy, who now regards anti-virus software developers as
	unethical in the extreme, said that although AIS was still
	on-line, this was only temporary. The virus
	source code in question was being picked up by MindVox,
	however, a commercial system based in NYC with links to the
	INTERNET, an advertising budget, and far more users than AIS.
	Meanwhile, ill winds on the networks were starting to
	blow. Unnamed hackers, enraged by the scandal, were said to
	be preparing to exact their pound of electronic flesh from
	Ferguson.

	"Too my mind, the AIS BBS was one of the best applications
	of my taxpayer dollars," said the USDA's Tirado angrily
	during an interview for this story. "The spineless curs!"


	PART II OF THE SORROW AND THE PITY: OP-ED AND ANALYSIS OF
	THE NEWSMEDIA

	MORE FEAR AND LOATHING:  ON THE VIRUS CODE TRAIL AT AIS

	On Saturday, June 19, the national press suddenly reared up
	and without warning, mangled the reputation of one of the
	finest, most professional security experts I know, Kim Clancy of
	the Bureau of Public Debt's Security Branch.

	I rolled out of bed Saturday morning, plugged into Compuserve's
	Today's News and was promptly crushed by the brazen stupidity of
	reporter Charles Bowen's newspiece, "GOVERNMENT BBS SAID TO
	HAVE AIDED COMPUTER INTRUDERS AND VANDALS".

	Bowen plagiarized the lead, "A government spokesman says an
	obscure bulletin board system run by a federal agency apparently
	helped computer vandals commit electronic sabotage," directly
	from a same-day Associated Press story called "Dial-A-Virus".

	But neither Bowen nor the AP offered a solitary shred of proof,
	other than this outrageously leading statement, loosely
	attributed to Public Debt spokesman Peter Hollenbach, that
	Kim Clancy's AIS BBS has ever been responsible for abetting
	documented cases of hacker intrusion or computer vandalism
	by virus.

	Further, Bowen reported, "The [Washington] Post says that among
	the visitors to the system were computerists using handles such
	as 'The Internet Worm,' 'Satan's Little Helper' and 'Dark Avenger's
	Mutation Engine.'"  The Washington Post story, reported by
	Joel Garreau, said nothing of the kind, leading me to believe
	Bowen is either a functional illiterate or willfully slack.
	Indeed, anyone who has visited AIS knows beyond a shadow of a
	doubt that the system NEVER supported handles of such nature.
	[Of course, Bowen can respond by blaming it on a copy editor
	and/or tight deadline, the last, best defense of lazy,
	inaccurate newsmen the country over.]

	These vague insinuations, however, were as nothing compared to
	the wellspring of the controversy, Garreau's "Treasury Exposed
	Computer Virus Info; Whistleblowers Halted Display Available To
	Anyone With A Modem" which brought into the public glare the
	chain of events that resulted in the removal of hacker tools,
	text files and commented virus source code from AIS.

	Although Garreau's story attempted to present a number of sides
	it was packaged so that a general reader would get a picture
	of a mad-dog government agency, finally "muzzled" after
	distributing dangerous code to "every maladjusted sociopath
	with Coke-bottle-bottom glasses."  More savagely irresponsible
	was the sideborn statement that treasury officials had neglected
	to "discipline" Clancy, instead merely removing the dangerous
	information from her system.

	It was a real rabbit punch; a cheapjack, ham-handed slam on
	Kim Clancy, successful in portraying her as someone who
	spends her worktime beta-testing intrusion software against
	her own department so that hackers might optimize their methods
	for computer subversion and vandalism.  This is hair-raising
	stuff, to be sure, for a general readership, but not the real
	truth.  It is my understanding, and something I've seen
	Kim Clancy make clear in lectures to many computer workers, that
	the whole point of working with hackers on the development of
	"Tone-Loc" software was so that it COULD and WOULD be
	supplied to interested security personnel who would use it
	to gain an understanding of how to harden their systems against
	tools employing similar technology.

	This is emphatically not the handiwork of someone who should
	be disciplined or professionally tarred, but the work
	of someone who Bruce Sterling, not me, says is "probably THE
	BEST THERE IS [emphasis mine] in the federal government who's
	not military or NSA.  Probably better than most CIA."

	Unfortunately, Sterling's appraisal was buried near the end
	of the story, after all the cracked shouting about aiding
	hackers and computer criminals.

	But I've walked away from the real nut of the matter: the
	presence of commented virus source code at AIS.  The significance
	of this is, in my opinion, beyond the current ability of
	mainstream journalists to evaluate simply because the vast
	majority of them have little technical grasp of the
	labyrinthine reality of computer security, what viruses are,
	how they work and don't work and where you find virus source
	code.  Certainly, The Washington Post story did nothing
	to convince otherwise.

	Consider these statements from The Post and some stony facts:

	    >>According to software writers, with the AIS information
	    "relative amateurs, could create new viruses."

	    This is dangerously misleading.  As point of fact, relative
	    amateurs DO, not could, create new viruses from source
	    code and they've done so for a long time before the advent
	    of AIS.  That AIS would be responsible for such a
	    development, which is already fact, is frankly idiotic.

	    >>Virus source code at AIS "is worse than making live
	    viruses available.  A person without the skill to write
	    a brand new virus could nonetheless produce a variation
	    on an existing one . . . If sufficiently mutated, the
	    virus might slip past anti-virus programs designed to
	    look for known products."

	    This presumes that most virus-writers, would-be
	    virus-writers and "Coke-bottle glasses-variety
	    sociopaths" have little access to source code.  This
	    is not even close to being true.  Virus source code
	    is now commonplace on professional, semi-professional
	    and amateur BBS's run by every stripe of user across the
	    country. In fact, it is almost as common as pirated
	    software and pornography in some locales. Surprisingly,
	    the higher quality virus disassemblies stocked on such
	    BBS's are often the handiwork of anti-virus
	    researchers and software developers. Strangely, this
	    has never been reported by a mainstream newsman, perhaps
	    because "designated experts" often come from the same pool
	    of researchers and developers.

	    >>". . . some computer professionals minimize the risk,
	    saying the software on [AIS] was acquired through the
	    computer underground in the first place, and thus has
	    always been available to miscreants with sufficient
	    contacts, tenacity and skill."

	    This is a particularly nasty one because its presented
	    as justification by those attacked and seems true.  It's
	    not.  It requires NO tenacity or particular skill to
	    get hundreds of viruses and assorted source code listings.
	    Unlike the stunt of hacking a mainframe from a dial-up,
	    which often requires great patience, a brute-force approach
	    or some technical skill as substitute, from teenagers to
	    middle-age men, anyone with a PC and a modem can dig up a BBS
	    devoted to virus code in almost no time.  Yes, they are that
	    common.

	    Why should this be?  Where have all those live viruses come from?
	    Paradoxically, many of the virus files on these BBS's bear the
	    electronic mark of software developers like Certus
	    International, S&S International and security organizations
	    such as the National Computer Security Association.
	    Damn.  How DO "relative amateurs" get ahold of
	    those samples? Of course, they could all be forgeries,
	    the work of some dangerous psychopath. Yeah, right.

	In any case, the only people who can't access the hacker
	files anymore are the security people. And the real story
	may boil down to what I call the "You dunno this information,
	it's too dangerous and and you don't have any business
	knowing about viruses and hacker files so leave it to us
	anonymous security experts and anti-virus researchers
	because we're here to serve and protect and we'll
	take care of all that stuff, thank you" explanation.
	It is the very essence of professional arrogance
	and hubris, in my estimation.

	There is, obviously, much more which should have been addressed
	by the mainstream media.  Why hasn't it, then?  Because it's
	not as sexy a story as the visceral blurt of noble civil servant
	whistleblowers bringing down a renegade government security
	BBS pursuing new ways to pervert the public trust out on the
	rim of cyberspace. And it would take time; it's a story that
	couldn't be researched and rushed into print in a week. It's
	complex, you see, and would be a great deal longer than the
	piece which ran in America's finest newspaper, The Washington
	Post.  So maybe we should all forget about fairness,
	because if it can't get into print at The Post, where will it?

	I hope Kim can continue her fine work and I'm angry at the
	stupid treatment this controversy has received at the hands
	of the newsmedia, so I'm writing to you about it because if
	I don't, I just might have to scream.

	HACKER GUIDE:  HOW TO TELL WHEN YOU'RE PART OF AN 'OFFICIAL'
	SCANDAL GENERATED BY THIRD PARTIES SKILLED OR LUCKY AT
	MANIPULATING THE PRESS

	The Crypt Newsletter doesn't claim credit for the idea and
	definition of the "official" scandal; instead, it's supplied
	by Martin Lee and Norman Solomon in their devastating
	criticism of journalistic methods, "Unreliable Sources: A Guide To
	Detecting Bias in Newsmedia" (1990, Lyle Stuart).

	The AIS mess has many of the trappings of an "official"
	scandal - that is, a catastrophe orchestrated by parties
	with a vested interest in seeing it handled "properly."
	Generally, such goings on are completely overlooked by
	the newsmedia until it becomes an easy pitch to wake up
	and produce a quick story with a lurid news hook.

	According to Lee and Solomon, "official" scandals have
	certain hallmarks.  Directly from their book, then, with
	embroidering comments by the Newsletter:

	1.  The "scandal" comes to light much later than it could
	have.  So it was with AIS:  The hacker files were removed
	from the BBS weeks before the story was retold in the
	newsmedia.

	2. The focus is on scapegoats, fallguys, as though remedial
	action amounts to handing the public a few heads on a
	platter.  Kim Clancy, as the administrator of AIS, is the
	fallguy, er, fall-lady, here.

	3. Damage control keeps the media barking but at bay.
	The press is so busy chewing on scraps near the outer
	perimeter that it stays away from the chicken house.
	While the newsmedia was chewing on AIS, it neglected to
	discover Paul Ferguson doing double-duty, CARO members
	helping themselves to dangerous code on AIS while
	complaining about it to others, and the ugly truth
	that much of the virus code and live viruses on amateur BBS's
	throughout the U.S. can be traced to AIS's opponents,
	a few anti-virus software developers.

	4. Sources on the inside supply tidbits of information
	to steer reporters in certain directions -- and away
	from others.  See Paul Ferguson and Peter Neumann of
	RISKS.

	5. The spotlight is on outraged officials -- in this case,
	"anonymous", Neumann and Ferguson -- asking tough, but not
	TOO tough, questions.

	ASK MR. BADGER:  OUR ROVING SPORTS DESK CORRESPONDENT, RAOUL
	BADGER, SUMS UP ON THE INFORMATION SOCIETY

       If you've ever had your day screwed up by what I call the
       "technological arrogance" of others - that is, had half an
       hour or more wasted straightening out a personal fiasco
       foisted on you by some anonymous white-collar boob driving
       a computer terminal at any service, infrastructure or
       banking-related institution, you're going to curse out loud
       when you see the the June 14 issue of BusinessWeek.

       But to ease you into that, I'm going to talk about hippies
       first.

       This month's Whole Earth has a reprint of a Bruce Sterling speech
       from '91 and stuff on encryption, Virtual Reality, the latest
       Cypherpunk hit, and review of various books on fractals, fuzzy
       logic, etc.

       If nothing else, it must be commended on having almost no
       digitized artwork.  Except for a few small shots of fractals and
       one shot of the Diet Pepsi commercial with Elton John and Louis
       Armstrong (which actually do seem to fit), there is only one whacked
       piece of artwork.  Since that's in a review of "WIRED," I guess
       I'll let it pass uncommented......

       Now, I don't know if you've been following the Whole Earth's gradual
       transformation/demise into a New Age burial ground for unwashed
       heathen, but for me it's a welcome relief.  I put up with their
       articles on the magical influence of women's menses. I tolerated
       their inexplicable reverence for R. Crumb (repeated in this
       issue as well). I even endured the sudden dearth of insightful
       reviews of tools, clothes, and real-life stuff.

       The last issue, however, was tops. It featured a diatribe
       against the North American male who is responsible for the wildly
       inaccurate belief that fat is ugly.

       When I beheld a picture of a three hundred pound porker, naked,
       offered as proof that all women are beautiful, I calmly, but
       surreptitiously, took the liberty of placing all the newsstand's
       copies of Whole Earth in what is euphemistically known as "Section F."
       That is, right next to the plastic-wrapped "Hefty Babes," and swore
       I would never deign to pick up -- much less buy -- such tripe again.

       Needless to say, I have again been proven premature in my vows.

       But, onward.

       The BusinessWeek article I warned you about ("The Technology Payoff")
       requires massive amounts of scorn, ridicule, and sarcasm from any
       sane, skeptical reader.  A life-long, proud adherence to a cynic's
       attitude is indispensible in avoiding thought contamination from
       it.

       It's subhead:

       "Business spent $1 trillion on information technology in the last
       decade  -  but showed little gain in efficiency.   Now, productivity
       is finally bursting out, thanks to better software and a

       in that productivity is only about 0.5 per cent above 1982 levels.

       SMOTHERING DOOM IN THE DESERT: VIRUSES, CHEMICAL WEAPONS
       DUMPS AND FATAL MYSTERY ILLNESS

       Jim Smith, a Ph.D. scientist working for the Department
       of Energy at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,
       New Mexico, home of the International School for Nuclear Weapons,
       was on the phone a couple of weeks ago asking The Crypt Newsletter
       why the national press was blaming the Navajo for the
       recent cluster of asphyxiating, mystery illnesses knocking
       more than a dozen dead in the desert of the reservations.

       "What's wrong with those candy-asses in the media? Why
       hasn't anyone asked about the military?" he said over the
       phone.

       "My colleagues have been discussing this and we think it's
       strange most of the cases are near Gallup, which isn't
       too far from an Army chemical weapons dump, Fort Wingate.
       Wingate was closed about a year ago but more recently, they've
       been moving materials out of it," he continued.  "What if something
       happened? You know, the desert is filled with off-limits places
       that we're kept out of because there are toxic spills in them.
       Funny, how no one is concerned about getting this 'disease' once
       the victims are in the hospital, but don't stir the dust
       up when you're in the area."

       Smith went on about how Albuquerque is rocked infrequently
       by strange, terrible explosions - the detonations of fuel-air
       canisters out in the desert south of Kirtland Air Force Base where
       the military tries to duplicate the overpressures of tactical
       atomic shelling so it can see the effect of blast waves
       on equipment and housing.

       Intriguing stuff.  Fort Wingate is indeed near Gallup; it's an
       installation which can be barely glimpsed south of Interstate
       40 as a weird-looking series of featureless structures close to
       the Arizona/New Mexican border.

       The military, unsurprisingly, has never commented on the exact
       nature and quantity of chemical weapons in its arsenal.  However,
       one class of weapons is noteworthy, here: the choking agents phosgene
       and diphosgene.

       Phosgene, produced simply by burning the solvent chloroform,
       has been manufactured by the U.S. military since
       World War I. Used first in great quantity during the British
       offensive at The Somme River, phosgene is an almost odorless,
       colorless gas which produces fatal symptoms which seem weirdly
       familiar.

       At the Somme, phosgene victims initially felt nothing more
       than a slight eye and nose irritation which passed.  Then,
       the victim might feel slightly euphoric, or slightly ill,
       while the lungs began to fill with fluid.  At a point, anywhere
       from 6-48 hours after initial exposure, the victim would literally
       begin to drown as his lungs filled; a thin, blood-streaked fluid
       might dribble from the mouth as the dying victim tried to
       expel the material accumulating in his lungs.  By 1918, the
       Germans had perfected a method of spreading phosgene as a dust;
       the gas was carried in the interstices of powdered pumice.

       In any case, the U.S. was no stranger to phosgene derivatives
       either, testing the gas and large quantities of mustard agents
       on Australian and Canadian volunteers at Brook Island, Queensland,
       in 1943. It was a a project of the utmost secrecy and it remained
       almost completely unknown until 1989 when an increasing flood
       of test subjects, some suffering from horrible disabilities,
       started to talk about it for documentaries and reporters. The
       U.S. also tested volunteers at Bushnell, Fla., Dugway Proving
       Ground at Tooele, Utah; Edgewood Arsenal, Md., and Camp Sibert,
       Alabama.

       It is not unreasonable to speculate that the U.S. retains large
       quantities of phosgene and diphosgene in its arsenal to this
       day.

       The "mystery illness" which has killed more than a dozen by
       sudden, inexplicable smothering has been attributed to the
       "hantavirus," however, a heretofor obscure microorganism found in
       the deer mouse. Infectious disease specialists speculate that the
       virus, shed in droppings, creates disease in humans when inhaled on
       fecal dust.  For the most part, medical writers in the press
       have accepted this explanation, leaving the story open and waiting
       for more conclusive testimony from official sources. Curiously,
       they have not questioned the military.

       For their part, the Navajo have proclaimed the rodent dropping
       explanation royal bunk.

       On June 19, The Washington Post in its continuing coverage of the
       story published this:

       "If we take the federal government by the way they have treated
	the American Indian from day one, then they are probably withholding
	information," said Albert Tinhorn, 38, a tribal chapter president,
	or government leader, from Dennehotso, Ariz.

       "I find it hard to believe the mice theory," Tinhorn said. "I think
	if there's any truth to be found, it's got to be in the toxic
	wastes, all the radioactivity around here. The federal government's
	been doing secret testing of who knows what out here for years.
	Ten years from now, we'll hear there was a coverup."

	Tinhorn agrees with tribal President Peterson Zah, who spoke in
	Washington, criticizing media coverage of the illness as a Navajo
	disease and offering examples of Navajos who have been treated
	poorly by outsiders.

       "The teeth of racism by the media and others have been bared
	against the Indian people," Tinhorn said. "The Navajo people
	have been very tolerant. Three or four Anglos have died of this
	disease, whereas the diseases brought over by the European people
	years ago wiped out entire Indian populations."

	And a week earlier, on the editorial page of the L.A.
	Times, Navajo Johnny P. Flynn wrote:

	"The young people who died were probably smart enough not to
	handle rat droppings, and they certainly did not get the
	disease from stirring up the disease at a sing or ceremony,
	because many young people no longer attend these.  No, this
	disease, some Dine' believe, will ultimately be traced
	to the [white man's] insistence on using Dine'tah as a
	dumping ground for their poisons."

	As food for thought, the reader might consider:

	  The Soviet explanation of an outbreak of rapidly
	  fatal pneumonic anthrax in the city of Sverdlovsk in 1979.
	  Soviet officials said anthrax-tainted meat was the culprit.
	  Western powers, including the U.S., said bullshit - it was a
	  mishap at a biological weapons facility, one which aerosolized
	  anthrax spores and swept them over the city.

	And this bizaare record of publicized chemical weapons
	mishandling by the U.S. military:

	  In March 1969, an nerve agent test gone bad at Dugway
	  Proving Grounds, Tooele, Utah, kills 6,300 sheep in
	  nearby Skull Valley.

	  In August 1969, the U.S. Army was accused of rail-shipping
	  a large quantity of phosgene from Denver to New York State
	  were it was to be sold to a plastics manufacturer.  Two
	  rail cars of phosgene eventually got lost in Buffalo for
	  a day.

	  Decemer 1969 - more nerve gas leaks at Dugway.

	  January 1969:  Two hundred canisters of the nerve agent,
	  VX, are discovered at the bottom of a recently drained lake
	  near Fort Greely, Alaska.  The poison had been stored on the
	  lake's ice, when it cracked through and sank in 1966.
	  Strangely, the Army never missed it.

	Keep in mind that all the information presented in this
	piece is purely circumstantial. But then, so is the "hantavirus"
	theory.

	IN THE READING ROOM:  'TECHNOLOGY REVIEWS' SPECULATES
	ON THE COLOR OF THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION. IT'S BABYSHIT BROWN,
	AS KURT VONNEGUT WOULD SAY.

	In my endless ramblings through the local newsstand, I ran across
	the July issue of Technology Review.  Technology Review is put out
	by the fine folk at MIT and features lightweight articles on a
	variety of "scientific" subjects; imagine a Discover magazine with
	fewer ads and you'll get the idea.

	The cover story is "The Children's Machine: How Computers
	Can Restore the Wonder of Learning".  It shows a baby in diapers in
	front of a terminal with an expression of wonder on his cherubic
	face. [The cynical will immediately note that the baby is, in fact,
	ignoring the monitor and staring at some attention getting device
	not shown.]

	But don't be fooled by the title, this isn't an article about
	computers in education.  No siree, it's about the Knowledge Machine!
	You know about the knowledge machine, don't you?  Why, you fool!
	Its the device that would allow a child to use "speech, touch, or
	gestures" to "quickly navigat[e] through a knowledge space much
	broader that the contents of any printed encyclopedia."

	As it turns out, the Knowledge Machine will allow a child to
	select an animal and see it "eating, running, fighting, or
	birthing...", all with  realistic sounds!  Even the smell and
	touch of being with the animals will be available!

	Parents will be glad to know that there is no lack of storage
	or access technology impeding development of the Knowledge Machine.
	No siree, Bob!  All we need to do is bring together the knowledge,
	and the enormous potential market for the machine guarantees that
	it will happen.

	By now you're wondering just who the heck thought all of this.  I'm
	not going to tell you . . .yet.  [Well, yes I am.] Because you
	should know that Professor Seymour Papert [Honest, that's his
	name!], does have some decent insights into educator's use of
	computers in the here and now.  He speaks of school administrators
	that view computers as things to be placed in "Labs".  Once
	safely cordoned in labs, curricula are drawn up.  Now computers
	become something to be taught, tested, and graded.  In the
	meantime, however, schools have inoculated themselves with a
	subversive element.  Computers aren't something students use, they
	are something students learn.  Here, I'll let the good professor's
	words speak for themselves:

	"...if "computer skill" is interpreted in a narrow sense of
	technical knowledge, there is nothing the children can learn
	now that is worth banking.  By the time they grow up, the
	computer skills required in the workplace will have evolved
	into something fundamentally different.  What makes the very
	very idea of banking computer knowledge truly ridiculous is
	that it undermines the only really important 'computer skill':
	the habit of using the computer for doing whatever one is doing.
	Yet this is exactly what was given up in shifting the computer
	away from the classroom."

	All of which seems to be perilously close to saying, "Let the
	little hackers play, dammit!"

	How then can this Professor Papert think that we're going to have a
	"Knowledge Machine" available to every four-year old anywhere in the
	near future? As it turns out, Professor Papert teaches learning
	research at the MIT Media Laboratory.  As it turn out, Professor
	Papert is a proponent of progressive educational ideas.

	People in this position really ARE screwed.  Ever since John
	Dewey came up with the idea of more self-centered education,
	reformers have been continually embarrassed that their reforms
	don't "bring about dramatically better learning."  [Those're
	Papert's terms. Most parents would state this "learn-at-your-
	own-pace-learn-whatever-you-want-shit" hasn't done anything but
	destroy a fairly decent educational system.]

	Sure enough, the professor insists that previous reforms failed
	because they didn't have the right tools.  Like Leonardo da
	Vinci, reformers lacked the infrastructure to create everything
	they envisioned.  Yeah, right. Regular Crypt readers probably have
	no need for me to say how full of self-serving horse-hockey this
	is.

	A decade ago, computers were going to solve our nation's
	educational problems.  NOW, it's going to take a combination
	of interactive CD's, a level of Virtual Reality technology that
	doesn't exist, gigabytes of memory, the power of a Cray, and an
	interface accessible to four and five year olds.  In the meantime,
	one must wonder if reliance on a non-existent form of technology
	really means that Professor Papert and other educational reformers
	have no good ideas for educating children in the present.

	Wake up and smell the coffee, Professor.  By the time we do have a
	"Knowledge Machine", parents will be up in arms about children
	being able to see unlimited footage of animals birthing.  By the
	time we have a Virtual Reality capable of reproducing the feeling
	of fur and the smell of a cow, Crypt readers will have
	some ***really*** interesting programming.

	JUMPING ON THE BANDWAGON: NON-FUNCTIONAL ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE
	IS WHERE YOU FIND IT
	**************************************************************

	The last couple of months have seen an explosion in the number
	of anti-virus toolkits found on the market.  A good case study
	is the example of the Russian product, Anti-virus System
	Protection, or AVSP.  Marketed by Planning Works International
	of Columbus, Ohio, the product appears to be sophisticated
	shareware with a $50 registration.

	In reality, it stands no chance on the market, being much less
	functional from an average user viewpoint than any of the
	current market heavies.

	AVSP comes with a fast scanner limited by only 129 virus
	signatures.  It's your job, says developer Andrew Borisov,
	to add signatures to it as you find viruses.  Bad plan.

	It presumes U.S. users will rely totally on the product's
	data integrity/checksummer program to flag files infected
	by viruses not included in AVSP's signature file.  Then
	comes the fun part.  Using AVSP's diagnostic tools, which
	include a disassembler and file viewer which graphically
	represents the changes an unknown virus has made
	to a file, the user is supposed to pluck out a signature from
	the virus code, copy it to a clipboard, and transfer it to
	AVSP's virus signature database.

	I tried this and after a couple stabs got it right with
	the Career of Evil virus included in Crypt Newsletter 15.
	Then came the fun part: infecting a bunch of files with
	Career of Evil and using AVSP to detect the virus.
	AVSP detected every file containing Career of Evil, it
	found the virus in memory, and even found the virus in
	memory when it wasn't there!  Howzzat?  AVSP, it seems
	holds your added signatures unencrypted in memory and then scans
	this position; quite naturally it finds the virus in
	memory every time.  This is an amazing screw up for $50
	shareware - effectively nixing the whole idea behind AVSP.

	AVSP's documentation is laughable; the product of someone
	who apparently learned English only yesterday.

	While it's true that segments of AVSP are well-done, the
	product is ill-conceived and clearly has no audience.
	Programmers capable of using the disassembler and do-it-
	yourself signature base don't need to spend $50 for this;
	average users would never feel comfortable with the software.

	There are many products currently in circulation which share
	AVSP's dubious functionality.  This is a direct result
	of the idea that there's "cash to be made in them thar
	hills!"  As such, you would do well to regard most of them
	as lousy buys until proven otherwise.

	It is doubly interesting that AVSP is Russian, licensed to
	America.  We've been lead to believe that Russia is packed full
	of unemployed programmers - all very skilled - working overtime
	to make viruses as revenge.  If they are all like the people who
	put together AVSP, they will have to work a lot harder, in
	the future, to make anyone lose any sleep at night.

	****************************************************************
	MORE MUTATION ENGINE STUFF AND DISMANTLING MICROSOFT ANTI-VIRUS,
	POLITELY
	****************************************************************

	This month's issue includes the PC WEEVIL, a polymorphic direct
	action .COMfile infector which utilizes The Mutation Engine (MtE),
	again.

	Big deal, you say!  Ah-ah-ah, not so fast.  Here at the newsletter
	we were quite intrigued by Mark Ludwig's study of polymorphic
	viruses in Computer Virus Developments Quarterly #3.  Ludwig pointed
	out the limitation of the engine, but he also looked at the flimsy
	reeds many anti-virus scanners have tied themselves to in search
	of the MtE.

	A minor diddle of code before the MtE decryptor kicked in caused
	most scanners to fail ignominiously.  We checked with later versions
	of scanners, most notably SCAN and FINDVIRUS and found that both
	products had cleaned up their acts - both caught Ludwig's demo
	virus.  However, the change was so fast we suspected that it
	was a bad kludge.

	Ludwig's initial change involved inserting 24 instances of the
	instruction "mul cx" before the Mutation Engine decryptor.  He
	rightly pointed out that this gives developers a constant handle
	in front of the main body of the virus which can be seized by
	a plain vanilla signature - in essence it puts a constant stream
	of instructions into a polymorphic virus, mitigating some of its
	features.

	Strangely, the "mul cx" instruction had the effect of completely
	wrecking the action of Microsoft Anti-virus.  Any virus using this
	sequence hangs the program thoroughly.  So we changed that segment
	to 24 instances of "jmp $ + 2 ", a nothing sequence which we
	assumed had a good chance of confusing things still further.  Micro-
	soft Anti-virus no longer hung, but it wouldn't even detect
	unencrypted versions of the virus, PC WEEVIL, included in this
	issue.  SCAN 106, FINDVIRUS and F-PROT 2.08 would only detect
	unencrypted copies, identifying the MtE code. Likewise with
	ThunderByte's TBSCAN.  This program was successful against
	plain-text copies of PC WEEVIL only. Heuristically, it
	noted only that files contained garbage instructions, only
	enough to trigger it's "infected" error flag if a series
	of positively identified viruses were also found on the disk.

	Leprechaun Software's The Doctor scanner, while very effective
	at detecting standard MtE samples (although we might add it has
	a high false positive rate), was equivalent to Microsoft Anti-virus
	against PC WEEVIL.

	The only thing left to do was to work around the nasty string of
	constant instructions - "mul cx's" or "jmp $+2's" or whatever -
	so that software developers would not be tempted to use a signature
	scan, instead working to make their MtE detection logic better.
	The Crypt Newsletter chose to insert 48 pairs of "00 00" words
	in front of the MtE decryptor as additional garble.  Take a
	look at a number of your executable programs under a file viewer -
	notice the many instances of repeated "00".  Obviously, this
	makes choosing a scan string from this sequence in the virus
	a less than desirable quick fix. Within the PC WEEVIL we've
	carefully pointed out the changes made to the code so that you
	can experiment will all kinds of garbling instructions as the
	anti-virus scanner wars continue.

	Most scanners can still detect plain-text, or unencrypted
	copies of PC WEEVIL, but they are blind to those where the
	Engine has turned successfully.  Only F-PROT 2.08 was
	capable of occasionally picking up one of the garbled
	copies of the virus.

	Also included in PC WEEVIL is a very short routine which enables
	to virus to rip through Microsoft Anti-virus's VSAFE memory
	resident utility.  This was pointed out by KohntarK, and the
	beauty behind it was so simple, I fell out of my chair
	laughing.

	The routine takes advantage of VSAFE's hooking of the keyboard
	interrupt, INT 16, so that a user can call up the program
	and reconfigure or de-install it at any point by
	hitting 'Alt-V'.

	The code is this:

	   mov  ax,0FA01h  ;<----wakes up VSAFE for keyboard input
	   mov  dx,5945h   ;<----asks VSAFE to deinstall
	   int  16h     ;<----calls the interrupt


	By loading VSAFE into memory and looking at the interrupt table
	with a memory diagnostic tool, you can see where the program
	hooks into INT 16.  By stepping into the VSAFE code at this
	point with a good debugger, you should have no trouble
	finding the branch point -

		   cmp   ax,FA01h

	which executes when the user, or a virus, steps through the
	code of interest.

	PC WEEVIL contains this sequence and it will easily go through
	VSAFE when it is resident without anyone being the wiser.
	We suspect, but leave it open for you to test, that the current
	versions of CENTRAL POINT ANTI-VIRUS are also vulnerable to
	this measure.

	Other than that, PC WEEVIL is fairly innocuous.  It will infect
	every .COMfile in the current directory on an initial run
	and is included as a DEBUG script and TASM 3.0 source listing.
	To make a working copy directly from the source code requires
	that you have the complete Mutation Engine archive, a common
	files on BBS's throughout the country.

	Simply link, thus,

	 TLINK /x /t pcweevil rnd mte pcweevil.com      .

	Also included in this issue is Black Wolf's DECOMPILE, a simple
	yet handy utility for decompiling Mutation Engine viruses into
	plain-text form.  Rather than using the standard DEBUGGING
	techniques outlined in Crypt 12, this utility completely
	automates the task.  Try it using some MtE generations produced
	by PC WEEVIL.

	Typing DECOM at the command prompt will cause the program to
	prompt you for an input file name, and a target file name.
	Then it will attempt to decrypt the virus and write it to
	the disk in its plain-text form as the target file.  A
	simple test for effectiveness is to look for the text
	embedded in PC WEEVIL, or use a program like SCAN 106 -
	which does not detect encrypted PC WEEVILs.  If DECOMPILE
	was successful, SCAN 106 will identify plain-text copies
	as [DAME].  Enjoy these programs and utilities.  And a
	big "Thank You" to Black Wolf for this fine public domain
	piece of code!

	What is the Crypt Newsletter?  The Crypt Newsletter is an electronic
	document which delivers deft satire, savage criticism and media
	analyses on topics of interest to the editor and the computing
	public.  The Crypt Newsletter also reviews anti-virus and
	security software and republishes digested news of note to
	users of such.  The Crypt Newsletter ALSO supplies analysis and
	complete source code to many computer viruses made expressly for
	the newsletter. Source codes and DEBUG scripts of these viruses
	can corrupt - quickly and irreversibly - the data on an
	IBM-compatible microcomputer - particularly when handled foolishly
	by individuals who consider high school algebra "puzzling."

	Files included in this issue:

	 CRPTLT.R16 - this electronic document
	 PCWEEVIL.ASM - TASM source listing to PC WEEVIL virus
	 PCWEEVIL.SCR - DEBUG scriptfile for PC WEEVIL virus
	 VSLAY.ASM - virus-mediated dismantling program for Microsoft
	 Anti-virus's VSAFE
	 VSLAY.SCR - DEBUG scriptfile for VSLAY
	 DECOM.ASM - Black Wolf's Mutation Engine "decompiler,"
	 supplied as source code.
	 DECOM.DOC - Documentation for DECOMPILE
	 WOLF.LIB - library file needed by DECOM.ASM
	 DECOM.SCR - DEBUG scriptfile for DECOMPILE

	 ----------------------------------------------------------------

	 To assemble programs in the newsletter directly from scriptfiles,
	 copy the MS-DOS program DEBUG.EXE to your work directory and
	 type:

		DEBUG <*.scr

	 where *.scr is the scriptfile of interest included in this issue.
