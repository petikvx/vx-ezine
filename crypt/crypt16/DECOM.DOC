                     DECOM 0.9á - MTE file decryptor

     This is a simple utility that will step through an MTE decryptor and
decrypt the virus it is attached to, then terminate before executing
the virus.  It is useful if you have an MTE-based virus and you want to
find out what virus has infected it - just decrypt it using DECOM, then
check the resulting file, looking after the decryptor.  This is a proto-type
version, and is NOT IN ANY WAY GUARANTEED!  I am only releasing this version
because to this date nothing else seems to be able to do this.  I am
also releasing the source code.  This will allow anyone who needs to be able
to disinfect MTE-based viruses to modify the code to- instead of saving the
result to disk -search it for the storage bytes, original SS:SP and CS:IP,
or whatever is needed for the disinfection routine.  Once I have gotten
time to come back to this, I will modify it into a generic encryption
bypasser, and add a few useful features in it.

        When used, it will attempt to follow the execution of the program
until the end of the MTE decryptor.  It will not execute INT calls, and
will terminate if one is encountered.  It also terminates if DS and ES
change, or if a far call or PUSHF is encountered.  THIS DOES NOT ABSOLUTELY
GUARANTEE SAFETY WHEN RUN!  While I have not encountered an MTE file that
it did not safely unencrypt, it is quite possible to program such.  The
viruses I have tested this on are POGUE, DEMOVIR, and the INSUFF series,
as well as a collection of my own test MTE files.  One possible time
when DECOM may go passed the decryptor is when the MTE does not actually
encrypt the code - this generally results in DECOM printing that it
can not safely decrypt it, whereas it was never actually decrypted.
I hope this is found to be useful at least as a coding example, if not
as a tool.  Good luck!
