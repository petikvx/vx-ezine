Computer viruses fascinate and terrify the computing population. Virus 
research has for too long been a closely guarded secret profession 
denied to outsiders. 

Servile Software sought to change the secret face of virus research in 
1994 by offering real computer viruses to the public at large. This 
met with uproar from the computing press and some members of the 
public who objected that criminal elements could now obtain computer 
viruses easily. The reality was however that computer virus authors 
have long been able to exchange viruses through a network of 
"underground" computer bulletin boards. In opening up the virus world 
I discovered that many virus authors are also keen anti-virus 
researchers, and many were keen to assist me in producing products and 
information which would help the public to defend themselves. Indeed 
the virus writers anger was mainly directed at the unscrupulous anti-
virus companies which they feel exploit public fears of computer 
viruses in order to make large amounts of money. 

The purpose of this handbook is to introduce proficient and not so 
proficient computer programmers to the techniques of virus research. 
It will show you how to disassemble and reverse engineer infected 
programs so that you can realise how the virus works and this 
information will then enable you to defend yourself without the need 
to spend large amounts of money on fairly useless anti-virus software.

                        BASIC RESEARCH METHODS


It should be noted here that most computer viruses are written in 
assembler, and a knowledge of 8088 assembler programming is a distinct 
advantage in virus research as most of the work involves analysing 
disassemblies. 


DISASSEMBLY:

The virus researcher has at his disposal a range of disassembly tools 
including; Sourcer, D86, Intelligent Disassembler, Servile Software 
Decoder, Turbo Debugger, Code View and Debug. Each of these tools has 
features and characteristics which makes it more useful in some areas 
than in others. For example; Sourcer is very good at producing 
assembly listing of .EXE and .COM viruses, but suffers from the 
handicap that some viruses have been so designed as to confuse Sourcer 
and prevent it from disassembling them. The Intelligent Disassembler 
appears to be immune from such virus design, but only copes with .COM 
files. It can't disassemble .EXE viruses. And no diassembler can 
provide a satisfactory disassembly of an encrypted virus. Turbo 
Debugger and Code View are two interactive assembly debug tools which 
can be used to trace program flow. As such they are both subject to 
attack by viruses, and as they execute the live code they can be 
hazardous. The Servile Software Decoder emulates each instruction 
making it immune to attack and particularly suitable for analysing 
virus actions and for decrypted encrypted viruses. My personal choice 
of tools is Servile Software Decoder for analysis, decryption and 
trace debugging and The Intelligent Disassembler for producing source 
code disassemblies quickly. 


TESTING INFECTION:

Deliberately infecting bait files is a useful way for determining 
common pattern's of bytes in infected files. These common patterns may 
then form the basis of a "signature" for recognition of future 
infected files. Deliberately infecting files can be hazardous, for 
obvious reasons. 

The first hazard is knowing exactly which files will be infected. You 
should first determine the infection technique of the virus. These 
techniques are: 

        * Subsequently executed programs
        * A file or files in the current directory
        * A file or files in the DOS search path
        * A file or files in the root directory
        * Other miscellaneous hard coded targets

The first method of infection applies to memory resident viruses. 
Memory resident viruses are among the safest to play with. The 
researcher may deliberately activate a memory resident virus - such as 
Pathogen - and then, being aware that any subsequently executed 
programs will be infected may deliberately activate a bait program in 
order to infect it. After infection the computer should be switched 
off and then back on again to remove the virus from memory. 

A virus which searches the DOS search path - as defined by the PATH 
statement, is fairly safe to play with. Establish a subdirectoy of 
bait files and specify this directory as the FIRST in the PATH eg; 

                     PATH=C:\BAIT;C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS....etc

This will then direct "path searching" viruses to the files in the 
bait directory. Remember though, that most viruses will test each file 
and if it can't be infected will move to the next, which may mean 
jumping directories. 

Another hazard is the activation routine or payload of the virus. Many 
viruses contain a routine to scramble disk data which will activate on 
a specific date, or day of the year, or time or whatever. Be aware of 
the conditions which cause the virus to activate so that you can avoid 
them. Otherwise use a special "suicide machine". Incidentally, the 
Black Baron virus author tested all his viruses and other peoples on a 
single computer, he maintains that the only way to test viruses is to 
be aware of the conditions which cause activation etc. Sound advice 
indeed! 

VSAFE, supplied with Centre Point Anti-Virus, and also with more 
recent copies of MS-DOS can also be useful. Set the general write 
warning on, and VSAFE will tell you when a program is about to be 
changed (for example by a memory resident virus). 

                        HANDLING DISASSEMBLIES


Disassemblies are often difficult to understand. However, with 
experience you will start to recognise common techniques and be able 
to slowly understand what the virus does and the all important how it 
does it from the disassembly. The following case study compares a 
disassembly of the "Doom" virus with the author's original source 
code. This will help you to recognise common virus techniques and make 
more sense of your own disassemblies.

DOOM VIRUS ORIGINAL SOURCE CODE

And this for comparison is the author's original source code of the 
DOOM virus. 

; My second scratch contribution to this issue. It's a simple non-over-
; writing, non-destructive exe-infector that "eats up" a bit memory on
; every run. It restore date/time stamps and uses an encryption routine
; to avoid discovery from virus scanners. Of'cos no virus scanners are
; able to detect it. This includes Scan/FindViru/MSAV/CPAV/F-Prot and
; TBAV's most heuristic scanner. Well, 9 out of 10 viruses, that's nothing
; but pure bullshit!, ha!, this "wanna-be" can't find a single flag in 
; this code!

; After these two moderate, educational viruses I'm planning to do some
; "fancier" memory resident viruses to the next issue. If I've got some
; time, that is. Fucking military service :)

From comparing the original source code with the disassembly you will notice 
the "encrypt/decrypt" sub routine below. 


LB02A2: MOV     SI,WORD PTR DS:LB02A0
        LEA     DI,WORD PTR LB0115
        MOV     CX,0c5h
LB02AE: XOR     WORD PTR [DI],SI
        INC     DI
        INC     DI
        LOOP    SHORT LB02AE
        RET


This is a common method of encrypting/decrypting a virus and once you 
study it you can easily locate it in other disassemblies. It is 
important to be able to recognise the purpose of routines in 
diassemblies so that the esoteric labels inserted by the disassembler 
can be replaced with more meaningful ones. 

Also helpful in determining a virus' behaviour is SSD. This analysis 
tool emulates virus execution so it is quite safe to run a virus 
through. Debugging tools such as Borland's TurboDebugger and 
Microsoft's Code View should be avoided when testing viruses as these 
types of debuggers actually execute the code. SSD however interprets 
each machine instruction and can therefore avoid being attacked by the 
virus - which is a problem with traditional debugging tools. A slip of 
the finger to the "run" button when testing or investigating a virus 
with a debugger can be disastrous, but with SSD it is quite safe! The 
following is an SSD analysis of a simulated execution of the DOOM 
virus;

                          BOOT SECTOR VIRUSES



Boot sector viruses are viruses which exist in the bootstrap record of 
a disk or diskette. They load into memory when the computer is 
"booted" from an infected disk and can only spread by infecting 
another disk's boot sector. 

Disassembling boot sector viruses is slightly more challenging than 
disassembling file viruses. First the boot sector virus must be read 
into a file. This can be acomplished quite easily with a program which 
will read the first sector of the infected disk and write the data out 
to a file. This file may then be disassembled in the usual way. 

Common boot sector viruses include "Pakistani Brain" and the more 
recent "Form Virus". 
                          POLYMORPHIC VIRUSES

In late 1993 a new type of virus started to appear. This virus was one 
that changed its form with each new infection making the determination 
of signatures very difficult. This was the "polymorph" type of virus. 
It was viruses which contained a polymorphic encryption engine. The 
best encryption engine was one created by a young unemployed English 
man who likes to call himself "The Black Baron". His encryption engine 
he called SMEG after the science fiction programme "Red Dwarf". The 
following is his documentation on the theory and practice of 
polymorphic engines which I commissioned him to write in the summer of 
1994;

This .DOC attempts to provide an insight into the workings of a 
Polymorph Engine.  It assumes you are familiar with 8086 assembler and 
the logic functions XOR, AND & OR.  To this end, no explanation of 
logic or assembler will be included in this text!  Also note, no 
SEGMENT stuff will be included in any of the assembler listings, it is 
assumed that you know which segments are in play.  The methods 
described in this .DOC are the ones used in my SMEG (Simulated 
Metamorphic Encryption Generator) Polymorph Engine and are by no means 
the only way to do it!

Question:  What is a Polymorph?
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Answer:    Well, the Longman English Dictionary defines it as:

   "POLYMORPHOUS also POLYMORPHIC adj fml or tech.
     EXISTING IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT FORMS."

In other words, something that has the ability to change it's shape.  
Other ways to describe such a thing might be;  Mutable, Metamorphic, 
Etc... 

Question:  What is a Polymorph Engine?
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Answer:    A program with the abilities to encrypt (or jumble up) another
           program or data and provide a unique decryptor for it, it must
           do this in such a way that no two encryptions of the same program
           or data will look alike.

Example:  Take the following ultra-simple decryptor:

               MOV      SI,jumbled_data     ;Point to the jumbled data
               MOV      CX,10               ;Ten bytes to decrypt
main_loop:     XOR      BYTE PTR [SI],55    ;XOR (un_scramble!) a byte
               INC      SI                  ;Next byte
               LOOP     main_loop           ;Loop for the 9 remaining bytes

This small program will XOR the ten bytes at the location pointed to 
by SI with the value 55.  Providing the ten bytes were XORed with 55 
prior to running this decryptor the ten bytes will be restored to 
their original state.  If you are unsure as to why this is, brush up 
on your XOR logic!! 

Ok, so you might say that if you change the KEY value on each 
generation it will become Polymorphic?  Well, yes and no!  If you did 
that, the encrypted portion would be Polymorphic, but the decryptor 
would still remain mostly the same, the only change begin the KEY 
value!  So, a signature scanner that allows WILDCARDS (and most do!) 
would still be able to find your decryptor! 

One way you could fool some signature scanners is to swap around some 
of the instructions.  So, with this in mind, the above decryptor might 
look like: 

               MOV      CX,10
               MOV      SI,jumbled_data
main_loop:     XOR      BYTE PTR [SI],55
               INC      SI
               LOOP     main_loop

As you can see, still not much of a change, not really enough to fool 
some of the better signature scanners. 

"GET TO THE POINT!  WHAT IS A TRUE POLYMORPH?", I hear you cry!
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Well, a "true" Polymorph would be a decryptor that looks completely 
different on each generation!  Take the following decryptor: 

               MOV      CX,10
               NOP
               NOP
               MOV      SI,jumbled_data
               NOP
main_loop:     NOP
               NOP
               XOR      BYTE PTR [SI],55
               NOP
               INC      SI
               NOP
               NOP
               NOP
               NOP
               LOOP     main_loop

This decryptor is the same as the one before it, but it has has a few 
random NOP instructions peppered throughout itself.  On each 
generation you would vary the amount of NOPs after each instruction.  
This is a Polymorph in it's simplest form.  Still, most of the good 
signature scanners would have no problem with such a simple Polymorph.  
They would simply skip the NOPs, thus having a clear view of the 
decryptor, to which they could apply a signature! 

No, a "true" Polymorph has to be far far more complex then this!  
Instead of peppering NOPs throughout the decryptor it would pepper 
totally random amounts of totally random 8086 instructions, including 
JUMPS and CALLS.  It would also use a different main decryptor 
(possibly from a selection of pre-coded ones) and would alter all the 
registers that the decryptor uses on each generation, making sure that 
the JUNK code that it generates doesn't destroy any of the registers 
used by the real decryptor!  So, with these rules in mind, here is our 
simple decryptor again: 

               MOV      DX,10              ;Real part of the decryptor!  
               MOV      SI,1234            ;junk
               AND      AX,[SI+1234]       ;junk
               CLD                         ;junk
               MOV      DI,jumbled_data    ;Real part of the decryptor!
               TEST     [SI+1234],BL       ;junk
               OR       AL,CL              ;junk
main_loop:     ADD      SI,SI              ;junk instruction, real loop!
               XOR      AX,1234            ;junk
               XOR      BYTE PTR [DI],55   ;Real part of the decryptor!
               SUB      SI,123             ;junk
               INC      DI                 ;Real part of the decryptor!
               TEST     DX,1234            ;junk
               AND      AL,[BP+1234]       ;junk
               DEC      DX                 ;Real part of the decryptor!
               NOP                         ;junk
               XOR      AX,DX              ;junk
               SBB      AX,[SI+1234]       ;junk
               AND      DX,DX              ;Real part of the decryptor!
               JNZ      main_loop          ;Real part of the decryptor!

As you should be able to see, quite a mess!!  But, still executable 
code. It is essential that any junk code generated by the Polymorph 
Engine is executable, as it is going to be peppered throughout the 
decryptor.  Note, in this example, that some of the junk instructions 
use registers that we are using in the decryptor!  This is fine, 
providing the values in these registers aren't destroyed.  Also note, 
that now we have random registers and random instructions on each 
generation it makes signature scanning (even for the clever signature 
scanners) impossible!  Instead, an HEURISTIC method must be used, 
which can lead to false alarms. 

So, a Polymorph Engine can be summed up into three major parts:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

  1 .. The random number generator.
  2 .. The junk code generator.
  3 .. The decryptor generator.

There are other discrete parts but these three are the ones where most 
of the work goes on! 

How does it all work?  Well, SMEG goes about generating random 
decryptors in the following way: 

  1 .. Chooses a random selection of registers to use for the decryptor.
       Leaving the remaining registers as "junk" registers for the junk code
       generator.

  2 .. Chooses one of the compressed pre-coded decryptors.

  3 .. Goes into a loop generating the real decryptor, peppered with junk
       code.

To understand how the selected registers are slotted into the 
decryptors and the junk code you must look at the 8086 instructions 
from a binary level: 

      XOR   AX,AX    =    00110001 11000000
      XOR   AX,CX    =    00110001 11001000
      XOR   AX,DX    =    00110001 11010000
      XOR   AX,BX    =    00110001 11011000

You should be able to see a pattern in the binary code for these four 
8086 instructions?  Well, all 8086 instructions follow logical 
patterns, and it is these patterns that tell the 8086 processor which 
registers/addressing mode to use for a particular instruction.  The 
total amount of instruction formats and the precise logic regarding 
the patterns is too complex to go into here. However, all good 8086 
tutorials/reference guides will explain in full. 

SMEG exploits this pattern logic to generate junk code and decryptors 
with random registers, as the patterns directly relate to the 
registers Etc. 

SMEG generates junk code in the following way:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Inside SMEG there is a table of the basic binary patterns for all of 
the 8086 instruction set, but with one important difference, all the 
register/address mode bits are zero.  This is called the SKELETON 
INSTRUCTION TABLE.  The table also contains various other bytes used 
by SMEG to determine the relevant bit positions to "plug in" the 
register bit patterns.  These patterns are plugged in via the logic 
processes OR and AND.  Using this method, SMEG can generate endless 
amounts of random 8086 instructions without destroying any of the 
registers used by the decryptor proper. SMEG also contains some 
discrete logic for producing false CALLS to dummy subroutines and also 
false conditional JMPS around the junk code. 

SMEG generates the decryptor proper in the following way:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Inside SMEG there is a table containing a selection of common 8086 
instructions used in decryptors, such as XOR [index],reg Etc.  These 
are, again, stored in SKELETON FORM with some control bytes used by 
the decryptor generator.  Also, inside SMEG, there are several pre-
coded decryptors stored in a compressed form.  On average, a complete 
decryptor can be described to the decryptor generator in as few as 11 
bytes and adding to the list of pre-coded decryptors is both painless 
and economical with space! 

SMEG generates the Polymorphed decryptor in the following way:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

First it chooses, at random, one of the pre-coded compressed 
decryptors. Next it goes into a loop uncompressing each decryptor 
instruction, plugging in the required registers, storing it and then 
generating (for each real instruction) a random amount of random 
instructions.  This loop repeats until the complete decryptor has been 
constructed.  The final result is a random size, random register, 
random patterned decryptor! 

It should also be noted that whenever SMEG generates an INDEXed 
instruction it uses either SI, DI or BX at random, also it sometimes 
uses a random offset. For example, say the encrypted code started at 
address 10h, the following could be used to index this address: 

       MOV   SI,10h     ;Start address
       MOV   AL,[SI]    ;Index from initial address

But sometimes SMEG will generate something like the following, again 
based on the encrypted code starting at address 10h: 

       MOV   DI,0BFAAh      ;Indirect start address
       MOV   AL,[DI+4066h)  ;4066h + 0BFAAh = 10010h (and FFFF = 10h)!!

These indexed and initial values are picked at complete random, and 
the examples of 0BFAAh and 4066h are valid, but next time they will be 
completely different! 

The following are two decryptors that were generated with my SMEG 
Polymorph Engine.  It should be noted that I generated 4000 examples 
with no two alike! Unfortunately I ran out of hard drive space!  But 
it is fairly safe to say that the total number of decryptor 
combinations would run into the BILLIONS! 

All the lines marked with ";junk" in the following listings indicate 
random junk instructions that were inserted throughout the actual 
decryptor, note that SMEG has the ability to generate junk CALLS to 
false SUBROUTINES, as well as general junk conditional jumps!  All 
lines marked with a * indicate an actual part of the decryptor proper.  
I chose the two generations shown because their sizes were similar, 
386 and 480 bytes.  SMEG produces decryptors ranging in size from as 
little as 288 to as much as 1536 bytes. Even if two decryptors are 
generated that are the same size the chances of them being the same 
are, literally, billions to one!

The following are the HEX dumps for both of the above decryptors, 
decryptor 1 is on the left and 2 is on the right.  These dumps are to 
show that it would be very difficult to find a signature that could be 
applied to each of these decryptors in the hope of detecting them 
both, this is the main purpose of a Polymorph Engine!  To detect, 
therefore, you would have to write a program that tries to use 
intelligence to work out if what it is looking at is a Polymorph 
generated decryptor.  This is prone to false alarms or, in certain 
cases, missing the decryptor totally!

enlightened and possibly inspired you into having a go at writing one yourself?

SCANNING ENCRYPTED PROGRAMS:

Encrypted computer viruses, are difficult to analyse because when they 
exist as a file on disk they are in an inactive state. They only 
materialise into their true code when loaded into memory and executed 
by the CPU. The diagram below illustrates the basic steps. 

 ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿         ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿         ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿        ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿

 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ                                ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ        ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


The encrypted code is meaningless. Apparently random bytes. But it 
commences with a non-encrypted, although possibly disguised, 
decryptor. When the program is executed, the DOS loader reads the 
program into memory and the CPU commences execution at the program 
entry point. The first section of code to be executed is the decryptor 
which changes the remaining bytes of the program into their real 
values. At the end of this phase the real program is in memory and 
vulnerable to detection and analysis. 

The problem is how to convert the encrypted code into the vulnerable 
real code. Stormbringer of Phalcon/Skism illustrated great success 
with detecting the Pathogen and Queeg viruses despite their 
polymorphic encryption with a program called "kill smeg" which he 
released into the public domain. Unfortunately public ignorance of the 
program resulted in it being shunned as a virus! 

The principle in Kill Smeg is so simple it is briliant. It relies upon 
a feature of the CPU called the "single step interrupt". When the 
"trap flag" is set, the CPU executes one instruction and then calls 
interrupt 01. At this point the stack pointer points 2 bytes before 
the next instruction to be executed. A simple mov bp,sp followed by an 
add bp,2 sets bp to point to the next instruction which will be 
executed. This allows an interrupt 01 handler to check what the next 
instruction to be executed is, and can abort program execution before 
the program being analysed does any thing nasty. 

To sum up the technique is as follows:

Load the program to be analysed into memory
Set up an interrupt 01 handler
Activate CPU single stepping
Activate loaded program
Abort loaded program when it tries to do anything unauthorised
Search memory which now holds a probably decrypted copy of the program

Unathorised commands include interrupt calls, which might be used to 
deactivate our single stepper. Far jumps and calls, which could be 
sneaky methods of accessing DOS or BIOS routines to carry out unwanted 
acts, etc. 

The following code was extracted from "Killsmeg" by Stormbringer.

                          ACTUAL CASE STUDIES



The following discussions of some viruses may assist you in 
understanding not only these viruses, but also the techniques used by 
viruses in general. 



CASE STUDY: PATHOGEN

Pathogen was the second virus released by the Black Baron and the 
first SMEG (version 0.1) encrypted .COM and .EXE appending virus. When 
an infected file is executed, Pathogen is loaded into memory where it 
first checks whether it should trash the host hard drive. It does this 
if the following conditions are all met: 

1) The infected file is a 32nd incantation
2) The system date says today is Monday
3) The system time says it is between 17:00 and 17:59

If all the conditions are met, except that today is NOT monday, then 
Pathogen will remove the floppy drive indicator from the CMOS RAM, 
thereby disabling any floppy rives and requiring a setup program to be 
executed. 

If the hard disk is trashed, Pathogen will also lock the keyboard, and 
change the CMOS RAM setup to indicate that NO floppy drives are 
connected, before writing random rubbish to the hard disk sectors in a 
random order. 

After checking for a disk trash, if the disk trash does not occur then 
Pathogen intercepts DOS execution commands. Any programs executed 
while Pathogen is resident will be checked by Pathogen, and if 
possible infected. 

When Pathogen infects a file it sets that file's year field to the 
21st Century. So files will NOT be infected if their year field is 
already set to greater than 1999 as Pathogen assumes them to be 
already infected. 



CASE STUDY: 10 PAST 3 (THE 748 VIRUS)

The 10 Past 3, or 748, virus was isolated in early 1991.  10 Past 3 is 
a memory resident infector of .COM programs, including COMMAND.COM. 

The first time a program infected with the 10 Past 3 virus is 
executed, this virus will install itself memory resident in low 
available system memory, hooking interrupts 21 and 6B.  Total system 
and available free memory, as measured by the DOS CHKDSK program, will 
not be altered. 

Once the 10 Past 3 virus is memory resident, it will infect .COM 
programs, including COMMAND.COM, when they are executed.  Infected 
programs will have a file length increase of 748 bytes with the virus 
being located at the end of the file.  The program's date and time in 
the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered.  No text strings 
are visible within the viral code. 

The 10 Past 3 virus activates between 15:10 and 15:13 (3:00PM and 
3:15PM) every day, at which time it will cause the "Ctrl" or "Shift" 
keys to be invoked occassionally when the system user enters a 
character on the system keyboard.  As a result, the character input 
may not be the same as what the user intended.  Additionally, it 
either disables or interfers with the functioning of the following 
devices on the days of any month indicated below: 

        1st day of any month - keyboard
        10th day of any month - system hard disk
        16th day of any month - system monitor/display
        29th day of any month - disk drives

On the 22nd day of any month, unexpected system reboots may occur.


CASE STUDY: THE 911 VIRUS
        
The 911 virus is a direct variant of the "Armagedon the GREEK" virus, 
derived merely by changing the text within and the dialing string. The 
virus' size is 1079 bytes, making the smallest carrier 1081 bytes.  
The main effect of the virus is to dial "911" every once in a while if 
a modem is present on com ports 1-4 (the original virus dialed the 
speaking clock in Greece).  It is a memory resident .COM infector. 

When executed, the 911 virus checks for residency.  If it is already 
installed, it simply passes control to the host file, otherwise, it 
goes memory resident, hooking Int 08h and Int 21h.  When 911 goes 
resident, it uses a rather strange way of doing it.  It re-executes 
the program and uses an Int 27 to go memory resident, but because of 
the second execution it does not truly terminate and is still able to 
return control to the host. 

Once memory resident, the 911 virus infect .COM files on execution 
(whenever an Int 21, function 4bh is called) after checking if the 
file has already been infected.  The identification string the virus 
uses to check for infection is the string "Support Your Police" 
located near the end of the virus (the original was "Armagedon the 
GREEK"). 

The infection process is also somewhat strange, as the virus allocates 
all unused memory for itself, the loads the entire victim file into 
memory in one call.  It then "infects" it in memory, and writes it 
back to the disk.  Afterwards, it releases the memory. 

All of the dialing and timing is handled from the Int 08 (Timer Click) 
handler.  When activated, it will dial 911 (police/fire/emergency) and 
wait for several seconds.  It sends the commands to all ports 1-4, so 
the results of hardware other than modems connected to these ports may 
be unpredictable. 

The storage bytes are found at the very end of the file, with the 
first byte encrypted by adding 0bh to its value.  Infected files may 
be repaired by restoring these bytes to the beginning, unencrypting 
the first one, and cutting the virus off the end of the host program. 
CASE STUDY: BAD BOY                                    
 
The Bad Boy virus was first detected in May, 1991, and came from 
Europe.  Bad Boy is a memory resident infector of .COM programs, it 
will infect COMMAND.COM. 

The first time a program infected with Bad Boy is executed, the virus 
will install itself memory resident at the top of system memory, but 
below the 640K DOS boundary.  Interrupt 21 will be hooked by the 
virus.  Interrupt 12 return is not moved.  If the virus became memory 
resident by booting from a disk with an infected COMMAND.COM, total 
system memory and available free memory as indicated by the DOS CHKDSK 
program will have decreased by 3,072 bytes.  If Bad Boy became memory 
resident by executing some other infected program (not COMMAND.COM), 
then the decrease of 3,072 bytes of total system memory will occur, 
but available free memory will have decreased by 6,704 bytes.  The 
additional bytes from available free memory is due to a low system 
memory TSR installed by the virus. 

After Bad Boy is resident, the virus will infect .COM files, including 
COMMAND.COM, when they are executed.  Infected .COM files will 
increase in length by 1,000 bytes with the virus being located at the 
beginning of infected files.  Occasionally, infected programs will 
increase in length by 1,001 bytes.  The file date and time in the disk 
directory will not be altered. 

Infected programs will contain two text strings, the first of which 
will be encrypted in replicated, natural infections of the virus. 
These text strings are not displayed by the virus: 

               "The bad boy halt your system ..."
               "The Bad Boy virus, Copyright (C) 1991."

The Bad Boy virus activates on a random basis, at which time it will 
appear to hang the system.  The hang is then followed by the virus 
scrolling several screens of repeated characters, and then a system 
halt occurs. 

Known variants of Bad Boy are:
       Bad Boy 2: A later version of Bad Boy, Bad Boy 2 does not have 
                  the TSR installed if the virus became memory from other
                  than booting from a disk with an infected COMMAND.COM.
                  The system hang, screen scrolling of characters, and
                  system halt may still occur, but not as frequently.
                  The text strings in the virus have been changed to:
                 
                  "Make me better!"
                  "The Bad Boy virus, Version 2.0, Copyright (C) 1991."

                  As with Bad Boy, the first text string is encrypted in
                  replicated samples of Bad Boy 2.

       Immortal Riot: Received in August, 1993, Immortal Riot is a
                  memory resident infector of .COM programs, including
                  COMMAND.COM.  It installs itself memory resident at the
                  top of system memory but below the 640K DOS boundary in
                  3,072 bytes of memory.  Interrupt 21 will be hooked.
                  Immortal Riod infects .COM files when they are executed.
                  Infected files will increase in size by either 1,054 or
                  1,055 bytes, or may have the first 1,054 bytes overwritten
                  by the viral code.  The virus will be at the beginning of
                  the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk
                  directory listing will not be altered.  The following
                  text strings are visible within the viral code in all
                  infected files:
                  "Senseless Destruction..."
                  "Protecting what we are joining together to take
                   on the world.."
                  "METAL MiLiTiA [iMM0RTAL RI0T] SVW"
                  The first text string above will occassionally be
                  displayed as a message on the system monitor.  At this
                  time a system hang may occur.
                  Origin:  Unknown  August, 1993.

CASE STUDY: THE PHALCON/SKISM SHINY HAPPY VIRUS

This virus was written jointly by Dark Angel and Hellraiser.It is a 
simple semi-stealth virus that doesn't actually replace interrupt 
21h's vector in the interrupt table. Instead, it finds the DOS 
interrupt 21h entry point and encodes an int 3 as the first byte. 
Consequently, it is highly debugger-resistant. It also hides the file 
size increase, albeit only in DOS directory listings.  This way, it 
avoids the CHKDSK cross-linking errors common to viruses hooking FCB 
find first/next.  The virus infects upon file executions.  

The virus always activates, hooking the keyboard interrupt.  When it 
detects a happy face (emoticon), the virus changes it to a frown.  The 
Shiny Happy residency test follows: 

Run the cursor across the following line:
        :-)     =)      \|-)    ;)      :*)
If any of the faces changed to frowns, then Shiny Happy is loose on your
system.

CASE STUDY: STORYTELLER

The Storyteller virus was detected in October, 1993. Its origin or 
point of isolation is unknown. Storyteller is a memory resident 
infector of .EXE programs, though it does not infect very small files. 
                                                                             
When the first Storyteller virus infected program is executed, the    
Storyteller virus will install itself memory resident as low system 
memory TSR of 3,568 bytes. Interrupts 08, 16, 21, and FB will be 
hooked by the virus in memory. The virus will install an additional 
copy of itself in memory each time an infected program is executed, so 
in case of advanced infections, the system will eventually run out of 
memory. 
                                                                             
Once the Storyteller virus is memory resident, it will infect .EXE 
programs when they are executed. Infected .EXE programs will have a 
file length increase of 3,184 to 3,196 bytes with the virus being 
located at the end of the file. The program's date and time in the DOS 
disk directory listing will have been updated to the current system 
date and time when infection occurred. The following text string is 
visible within the viral code in all Storyteller infected programs:
                                                                             
"STORYTELLER"                                                 

Ocassionaly, the Storyteller Virus will display the following text 
within a box on the system monitor:                                   

"Sitting on a grassy,beneath one of                          
the window of the church,was a little                        
girl.With her head bent back she was                         
gazing up at the sky and singing,while                       
one of her little hands was pointing                         
to the a tiny cloud that hovered like                        
a golden feather above her head.So co-                       
mpletely absorbed was she in watching                        
the cloud to which her string song or                        
incantation seemed addressed,that she                        
did not observe me when I rose and went                      
toward her.As I slowly approached the                        
child,I could see by her forehead,which in                   
the sunshine seemed like a globe of                          
pearl, and especially by her complextion                     
that she was uncommonly lovely.Her eyes                      
--which at one moment seemed blue_gray                       
at another violet,were shaded by long                        
black lashes,curving backword in a most                      
peculiar way,and these matched in hue                        
her eyebrows, and the trees that were

This text is encrypted within the viral code, as are the following 
text strings:                                                          

               "By    :      Theodore Watts-Dunton"                          
               "Sir   .        Press any key"                                


The Storyteller virus is a resident .EXE file infector. It's most 
noticeable feature is display of a poem by Theodore Watts-Dunton. 
                                                                             
Upon execution of Storyteller it hogs 51.824 K of RAM. On execution of 
an infected file the virus only uses 7 k of RAM. Interrupts hooked are 
8h and 21h.                      
                                                                             
Viral code and encrypted text is appended to the end of the .EXE file.       
The .EXE files grow by 3,118 bytes. Infected programs seem to function      
normally. I would like to note that this virus does not go for the          
COMMAND.COM file which is unusual. The program usually infects what 
you run. It doesn't seem to go out of it's way to infect files. I 
would also like to mention there is no stealth, boot sector, 
or part table infections.
CASE STUDY: AIDS 

The AIDS virus, also known as the Hahaha virus in Europe and referred 
to as the Taunt virus by IBM, is a generic .COM and .EXE file 
infector.  When the virus activates, it displays the message "Your 
computer now has AIDS", with AIDS covering about half of the screen.  
The system is then halted, and must be powered down and rebooted to 
restart it.  Since this virus overwrites the first 13,952 bytes of the 
executable program, the files must be deleted and replaced with clean 
copies in order to remove the virus.  It is not possible to recover 
the overwritten portion of the program. 

       Note: this is NOT the Aids Info Disk/PC Cyborg Trojan.

Known variants of AIDS are:

       AIDS B: Very similar to the original AIDS virus, this variant is
               also 13,952 bytes in length.  Unlike the original virus, it
               will only infect .COM files, as well as COMMAND.COM, and
               does not activate as the original virus did.  Instead, this
               variant will occasionally issue the following error message:
               "I/O error 99, PC=2EFD Program aborted". 

       AIDS-1992: Isolated at several locations in the United States in
                  May, 1992, this variant of the AIDS virus has been altered 
                  to avoid detection by anti-viral utilities.  Among the 
                  changes to the virus are that it will not infect files if 
                  there are less than two subdirectories on the current drive.  
                  System hangs may occur when infected programs are executed, 
                  as well as the system video mode may be switched to 25 x 40 
                  Black & White from colour mode.

 Well well, here it is... I call it AIDS... It infects all COM files, but it is
 not perfect, so it will also change the date/time stamp to the current system.
 Plus, any READ-ONLY attributes will ward this virus off, it doesn't like them!

 Anyway, this virus was originally named NUMBER ONE, and I modified the code so 
 that it would fit my needs. The source code, which is included with this neato
 package was written in Turbo Pascal 3.01a. Yeah I know it's old, but it works.

 Well, I added a few things, you can experiment or mess around with it if you'd
 like to, and add any mods to it that you want, but change the name and give us
 some credit if you do.

 The file is approximately 13k long, and this extra memory will be added to the
 file it picks as host. If no more COM files are to be found, it picks a random
 value from 1-10, and if it happens to be the lucky number 7, AIDS will present
 a nice screen with lots of smiles, with a note telling the operator that their
 system is now screwed, I mean permanantly. The files encrypted containing AIDS
 in their code are IRREVERSIBLY messed up. Oh well...

 Again, neither CPI nor the author of Number One or AIDS endorses this document
 and program for use in any illegal manner. Also, CPI, the author to Number One
 and AIDS is not responsible for any actions by the readers that may prove harm
 in any way or another. This package was written for EDUCATIONAL purposes only!
CASE STUDY: ARF ARF

The Arf arf virus is reported by F-Prot as being the Violator virus, 
this is wrong. Arf arf is a unique virus in its own right written by 
Rabid.

it's own reveals the following actions:

Further analysis reveals that Arf infects a single .COM file in the 
current directory. There seems to be some rather peculiar triggering 
criteria. Any way, the important thing is that infected files contain 
the strings "Arf Arf Got you!" and " -- RABID '90" which are easy to 
detect with grep, or a hex disk editor. 

CASE STUDY: BAD BRAINS 

Bad Brains is a .COM infecting, encrypted non-resident virus.

The Bad-Brains seems to be the second 'little brother' virus. What I 
mean by this is that the virus is a striped down form of the 
Hellraiser virus, much the same as 808 was to 1992. 

The virus works the same as the Hellraiser virus as far as encryption 
and infection go. 

The virus does not seem to have any distructive side effects besides 
infecting files. 

The virus contains the strings:

      "SKISM"
      "Bad Brains"
CASE STUDY: BEAST-N-BLACK

The Beast-n-black virus was written in 1992 by "Night Crawler" of 
Phalcon/Skism. This is his own notes on the virus: 
                      
                      >> Beast-N-Black v1á <<

                      (C) 1992, Night Crawler

                     -<>-  SKISM/PHALCON  -<>-


It's finally finished! I never thought I'd be writing viruses, but due 
to the recent downfall of my favorite board (Digital Warfare), I 
finally said, "Fuck it!" and wrote this lame little virus. Here's what 
it does: 

Direct-action COM infector. Any COM in the current directory 1024 bytes
or larger will be infected. Will infect through Read-Only and Hidden
file attributes. Restores original time/date stamp and attributes upon
completion. Infected files increase by 429 bytes. The original BEAST.COM
contains the following text, "Beware the Beast-N-Black (C) 1992, Night
Crawler - SKISM/PHALCON!"  Infected files will only contain the "Beware
the Beast-N-Black" part of the text. Although this virus will infect
COMMAND.COM, I have experienced -NO- problems with booting from an
infected copy. Also, no other damage besides filesize increase is
implemented in this version.

Ok, now that I'm done with that shit, I'd like to say, "Thanks" to all 
the members of SKISM/PHALCON for allowing me to be a member of their 
wonderful organization. I'd also like to say, "Fuck You!" to the rest 
of the world! Haha, Chaos-N-Anarchy will rule supreme!

CASE STUDY: The Burglar Virus

The Burglar virus is a Resident .EXE appending infector. It is also a 
very sophisticated piece of code which is very difficult to 
disassemble! What Burglar appears to do is to copy itself into memory 
at the end of the interrupt table and hook into interrupt 21h which it 
changes to address 0058:9FA9. Then, whenever a DOS service call is 
made the virus takes control. 

Burglar infects any .EXE files which are DIR listed, COPYed, or opened 
by DOS (eg: TYPE xxxx.exe will cause xxxx.exe to be infected). During 
a COPY the source file is first infected and then copied, so that both 
the source and target files are infected. 

You can check for residency by inspecting INT 21h, and you can detect 
infected files by looking for the signature strings listed at the end 
of this message. 


Quick SSD analysis of a Burglar infected program:

Interrupt 21

Read offset of vector 21
Read offset of vector 21
Set vector 21 offset to :9FA9
Read segment of vector 21
Set vector 21 segment to 0058:
Get segment address of program


Infected files contain the two strings

NB:
Burglar is NOT DETECTED by any known virus scanners at this time
CASE STUDY: The Vengeance Virus

The Vengeance virus was written in February 1992 by Decimator of 
Skism/Phalcon, and publisged in 40 hex magazine issue 5. The following 
is the author's original documentation about the virus: 

                              =================        
                               Vengeance Virus
                              =================

                              SKISM/PHALCON '92

                             Private release for
                              * Night Crawler *
                                  02/03/92

 NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS UNTIL AFTER THE RELEASE OF 40HEX 5!!

        The story behind this one is simple...  it's dedicated to the 
memory of Digital Warfare, which was confiscated by local police after
Instigator was nailed for phreaking.  The board was taken down 01/20/92.
This virus was created shortly afterward, and is to be released publically
in 40Hex Issue 5.  This file is the same virus which is being released in
40Hex 5, except it's in .COM form.  I'm sending it your way so you can add
it to your collection, and pass it around AFTER 40-Hex 5 comes out.
        After then, I don't care where it goes...  I'd PREFER it went 
straight to MCI's computer system and the Hard Drive of Mr. Terry Oaks.  But
I doubt it will ever get there. <sigh>
        
        Stats:
 
        name: Vengeance Virus
        size: 723 bytes
        type: Non-Resident Parasitic .COM infector
        
        Vengeance lives up to it's name.  As I said, it's a tribute to
Digital Warfare.  The virus will spread to any .COM file larger then 1992
bytes, and follows the current path to replicate.  On the 20th day of every
month, Vengeance will activate.  On XT systems, the system will display this
message:
                    *** Vengeance is ours! ***

and will start beeping, and lock up the system.  However, since XT's don't
keep the date, chances are it will never activate on them.  On AT and better
machines, the virus will display the above message, then format the first 32
tracks of the C: and D: drives.  After that, it will begin beeping, and lock
up the system.  If a key is pressed,the beeping will turn into a steady tone.
The only way to shut up the computer is to hit rest or power down.  All info
on the hard drives will be lost, as the boot record and FATs will be
decimated, along with a good portion of data.
        Other text which is found in the virus, but is not displayed, is
"SKISM/Phalcon '92". (Had to let ole Johnny boy know who's responsible...)
        Vengeance is definitely something you don't want to get hit with.
It's not just annoying, as Anti-Fire (dubbed "Infinity" by McAfee) was.  I
tested the code on an XT, and an Epson 386sx...  I set the date for the 20th
on both machines, then ran the virus.  On the XT, the HD was not formatted,
but the beeping and lockup did occur.  On the 386sx, the drive was destroyed,
and the machine locked up as it was supposed to.
        People wonder why we release destructive viruses...  I never thought
I would, but after Terry Oaks pissed us all off, well, I figured I'd make 
one especailly for those who knew jerks like him, and wanted to get even.
So, until this thing is SCANned, maybe we can wipe out a few dozen warez
dewds and pirate boards...  that would at least give a little value to this
thing.  
        As of SCAN 86, this thing is not detected.  F-Protect will find it
as a "Vienna" varriant, which it is...  it's based on the Violator code, 
which is a hack of Vienna.  Other virus scanners might pick it up, but SCAN
doesn't.

CASE STUDY: The Joshi Virus

The author of the following documentation is unknown.


Aliases:     Happy Birthday Joshi, Stealth Virus 
Discovered:  June, 1990 
Symptoms:    BSC, machine hangs and message 
Origin:      India 
Eff Length:  N/A 
Type Code:   BRX - Resident Boot Sector/Partition Table Infector 
Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, Pro-Scan 1.4+ 
Removal Instructions:  CleanUp V66+, Pro-Scan 1.4+, RmJoshi, 
                       or Low-Level Format Harddisk and DOS SYS floppies 

The Joshi Virus was isolated in India in June 1990.  At the time it 
was isolated, it was reported to be widespread in India as well as 
portions of the continent of Africa.  Joshi is a memory resident boot 
sector infector of 5.25" diskettes.  It will also infect hard disks, 
though in the case of hard disks it infects the partition table or 
master boot sector rather than the boot sector (sector 0). 
 
After a system has been booted from a Joshi-infected diskette, the 
virus will be resident in memory.  Joshi takes up approximately 6K of 
system memory, and infected systems will show that total system memory 
is 6K less than is installed if the DOS CHKDSK program is run. 
 
Joshi has some similarities to two other boot sector infectors. Like 
the Stoned virus, it infects the partition table of hard disks. 
Similar to the Brain virus's method of redirecting all attempts to 
read the boot sector to the original boot sector, Joshi does this with 
the partition table. 
 
On January 5th of any year, the Joshi virus activates.  At that time, 
the virus will hang the system while displaying the message: 
 
             "type Happy Birthday Joshi" 
 
If the system user then types "Happy Birthday Joshi", the system will 
again be usable. 
 
This virus may be recognized on infected systems by powering off the 
system and then booting from a known-clean write-protected DOS 
diskette.  Using a sector editor or viewer to look at the boot sector 
of suspect diskettes, if the first two bytes of the boot sector are 
hex EB 1F, then the disk is infected.  The EB 1F is a jump instruction 
to the rest of the viral  code. The remainder of the virus is stored 
on track 41, sectors 1 thru 5 on 360K 5.25 inch Diskettes.  For 1.2M 
5.25 inch diskettes, the viral code is located at track 81, sectors 1 
thru 5. 
 
To determine if a system's hard disk is infected, you must look at the 
hard disk's partition table.  If the first two bytes of the partition 
table are EB 1F hex, then the hard disk is infected.  The remainder of 
the virus can be found at track 0, sectors 2 thru 6. The original 
partition table will be a track 0, sector 9. 
 
The Joshi virus can be removed from an infected system by first 
powering off the system, and then booting from a known-clean, write-
protected master DOS diskette.  If the system has a hard disk, the 
hard disk should have data and program files backed up, and the disk 
must be low-level formatted.  As of July 15, 1990, there are no known 
utilities which can disinfect the partition table of the hard disk 
when it is infected with Joshi.  Diskettes are easier to remove Joshi 
from, the DOS SYS command can be used, or a program such as MDisk from 
McAfee Associates, though this will leave the viral code in an 
inexecutable state on track 41. 

CASE STUDY: The Sicilian Mob Ia Virus 

The Sicilian Mob Ia virus was written by Rock Steady of NuKe in 
September 1991. His original documentation follows:

;
; Virus NOTES: It's here `Sicilian Mob Ia' Virus. And UNDETECTABLE as of the
;       Sept & Oct 1991. This Virus wuz an development from the Vienna Virus.
;       Though is VERY different, this one had to be changed a HOLE fucken
;       lot to make it UnDectable from McAfee & Ass (Scan 7.2V80). And I made
;       this one a Signature Virus. Passing the word that NUKE rules...
;-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
; VIRUS: Well this Virus InFects Only *.COM and the COMMAND.COM. One thing
;        about the Infection method is that there is a Random Generator in
;        the Virus and 6 out of 7 times it will infect a *.COM and 1 out of
;        7 times it will do a Warm Re-Boot. (No Memory Count) And when it
;        Infects a file it will NOT change the Date and Time of the File!
;        This Virus is Also Able to Infect READ ONLY, files, it will change
;        the file to Read/Write and infect it, and then turn it back to READ
;        ONLY. The only sign of detection is that the infected files grow
;        by 1024 Bytes. This Virus is not Ram-Resident, and when firsted
;        runned it will try to infect MORE than ONE *.COM file. It does
;        at the Current Directory searching for *.COMs and then Uses the
;        PATH to get MORE *.COM files. If there is NO PATH the virus
;        will go to the ROOT Directory and search for Sub-Directories
;        And Once in a PATH it Checks for SUB-directories to INFECT
;        EVEN MORE *.COM. And AFTER January 1st, 1992 it will display a
;        Message that is HARD-CODED in the virus! The message will be
;        DISPLAYED EVERYTIME a Infected Program is Runned! And still continue
;        to infect *.COM after Jan 1st 1992 but you'll see the message being

; HIGHLIGHTS of Sicilian Mob II : This Virus will Infect *.COM and *.EXE Files
; and will [NUKE] all drives from A-Z. On a certain dated. Infected files
; still keep the same date and is bigger by 1200Bytes. Basically the virus
; is like the First one. Just harder to detect from Scan (7.2V80 or latest)
; and will do a Low-Level Format on a certain Date.

; VIRUS: Well this Virus InFects Only *.COM and the COMMAND.COM. One thing
;        about this Virus is that On MONDAYS it wipes out the BOOT,FAT,DIR
;        sectors from you C: Drive! What I like to call "Bloody Mondays"
;        So it Wipes Drive C: and then Displays a Message!
;        Other than Mondays the virus copies itself to as Many files it
;        can find thru the PATH from DOS and searching for Sub-Directories
;        With-in those Dos PATHs... Or if it can't find a PATH well then it
;        Starts at the ROOT dir and works thru the drive... 70% of the time
;        the virus will just spread and copy itself. 20% of the time the
;        virus will Make "Machine Gun Noices" in the PC speaker then
;        displaying my message and then continues to infect files...
;        FINALLY the last 10% of the time the virus will Re-Boot the system!
;        Aarrggghh..So the "Average" Lamo user will know FAST something is
;        fucking his system... and the BEST part is that SCAN can't find this

CASE STUDY: The Captian Trips Virus

The author of the following documentation is unknown.

Aliases: SKISM 12
Symptoms: .EXE and .COM files infected.
Orgin: New York
Eff Length: 1800 - 1810 Bytes
Type Code: Resident .COM and .EXE infector.


The Captian Trips virus, when executed, will install it self in memory and 
will infect any .COM or .EXE file that is run. 

If the virus is run on the last Friday of the month all files that are 
run will be truncated to zero bytes, rendering the file un-
recovorable. 

It is not known what the activation date is, but it is said that the 
virus will periodically tamper will the i/o ports of the system and 
blank the screen at random times. 

This virus contains the string:

      "Captian Trips"

Captian Trips was the virus from the book _The Stand_ by Stephen King.

Known varient(s)

Captian Trips B: Same as Captian Trips except a few critical bytes 
have been changed to avoid detection. 

CASE STUDY: The Marauder Virus 

Marauder Virus
By Hellraiser
of Phalcon/Skism

Aliases: Deadpool-B, 808-B, 860.

Marauder is a non-overwriting, non-resident, encrypting, semi-mutating,
.COM file infector.

When a file is infected with the Marauder Virus the virus will search 
the current path for a .COM file and infect it, adding 860 bytes to 
the files size.  If no .COM files reside in the current directory, the 
virus will go up one directory and check for .COM files to infect 
until it reaches the root.  At the root directory the virus will scan 
for other directorys to find .COM files, until one uninfected .COM 
file is found.  If no .COM files are found on the disk the virus will 
terminate it search and return to the currently running program. 

If an infected file is run on Feburary second of any year, the virus 
will destroys all files in the current directory, by overwritting them 
with message code.  The files will not run when executed, just 
terminate upon reading the first line.  There is no way to recover the 
files once the virus destroys them.  After this, control will be given 
back to the host program. 

The Maruder virus is able to infect any .COM file no matter what 
attribute... Hidden, System, Read-Only, etc... The files date, time, 
and attribute will not be changed after a file becomes infected. 

The virus will not cause a system error if run on a write-protected 
floppy or fixed-disk, merely terminate any attempt of infection. 

The virus will not infect files under 16 bytes or over 64,675 bytes. 

For the most part the virus is randomly encrypted with each passing 
infection, the small part of the program code which is not encrypted 
mutates between two different, but comaptable strains of bytes. 

There is no way of detecting the virus infections other than the 
addition of 860 bytes to infected files, in other words, system-run 
time is not affected at all.  If any run-time is affected it is the 
one second it takes for the virus to find and infect a file. 

The virus causes no damage to disk sectors or boot records etc... The 
only damage is the destuction of all files in the current directory on 
02/02/XX.

CASE STUDY: The Anti-FiRe virus

The authors original documentation for this virus follows:


Virus: Anti-FiRe
Aliases: ReplicatoR, InFiniTy (or whatever else they think of)
Size: 750 bytes
Activates: the 21st of every month
Symptoms: .COM file growth, message displayed
Type: Non-resident Parasitic .COM infector
Detection: Possibly a scanner which finds violator, not SCAN or CPAV (yet)
Removal: Delete infected files

This virus is a hack of the RABID Violator strain C, which has been 
altered to avoid detection by SCAN v85.  Instead of killing all the 
drives, as violator C does, this simply replicates, (infects 1 COM 
file each run) and on the 21st of every month, displays a message 
after a file is infected.  The following text can be found in all 
infected files: 

       "ReplicatoR", "Dec", "FiRe is a LAMER... destroy InFiniTy"

NOTE:
The only text which is displayed is "FiRe is a LAMER... destroy 
InFiniTy". The reason being, FiRe (ex prez of NEUA) is so lame.. can't 
crack, can't supply, can't program, can't run or set up his own net 
<InFiNET> and he thinks he's really cool.  He has this "I'm a BAD 
dude" attitude, and I decided it's time he and other warez dewds get 
the message.. he's a LAMER!  So, all I can say is I hope this little 
baby somehow gets back to him. BTW - this virus contains no 
destructive code, and infects files over 400 bytes, and under 64,000 
bytes in size.  Also will not infect if FluShot or Virex PC are active 
in memory. CASE STUDY: The Rage Virus 

The Rage virus was written by Data Disruptor in May 1991. His original 
documentation follows: 


                 ----------------------------------------------
                 Rage - Transient/Stealth/Mutating/COM Infector
                 ----------------------------------------------
                            Completed May 31, 1991
            Written by Data Disruptor with special thanks to Zodiac

 
 Order of Infection
 ------------------
        (1) Current directory
        (2) Root directory if no other files are found in (1)

 Stealth (???)
 -------------
        o Will detect the presence of FluShot+ and VirexPC. Will not execute
          under the influence of these utilities.
        
        (Due to the makeup of Norton's Disk Monitor, I was unable to find a 
         way to detect it at present time)

 Infection Size
 --------------
        o Infected files are increased by 575 bytes
        o Files under 2000 bytes will not be infected
        o Files over 63425 bytes will not be infected

 Randomizer Routine
 ------------------
        o Every time a file is infected, there is an approximate 1 in 16 chance
          that a message;

          "Pray for death - RABID '91"

          will be printed.

 Mutation
 --------
        o This virus encrypts itself differently every time it infects a file.

        (Note: It is quite easy to develop a scan string for this virus as the
         decryptor remains the same all the time. This will be remedied in
         version 1.1 by encrypting the decryptor... If you get what I'm saying)

 Destruction
 -----------
        o On the 13th of every month, Rage will clear the screen and display;

          "Rage - RABID Int'nl Development Corp. '91
           By Data Disruptor - Thanks to Zodiac"

          It will then attempt to format all drives starting from drive C: on
          through Z:, corrupting 255 sectors of each drive.

 Identification
 --------------
        o If you fear that you have infected yourself, simply search for the
          string;

          Patricia Boon

          which at no time is encrypted.

        (My girlfriend thinks that I don't write viruses, therefore, I said
         I'd prove to her that I do by putting her name in my next virus and
         "spread her name around the world...")

 Thoughts
 --------
        o Due to the appearance to the text "Patricia Boon", this virus will
          more than likely be called, "Patricia", but seeing as how there 
          allready, unnoficially, is a virus called "Patricia", this may end
          up being called "Patricia ][" or Flash Force's Nightmare name of
          "Boon".

        o Unless the virus-guru's successfully disassemble this virus, only
          then will the name "Rage" come out. (Fortunately, McAffe is good at
          that sort of thing)

 Final Note
 ----------
        o I am releasing the original virus in an infected MAKESTND.COM with
          filesize 3128 bytes. Run the program, then hit CTRL-BREAK to
          terminate.

CASE STUDY: The Deadpool virus

Deadpool Virus
Created 12/13/91
By Hellraiser
Of Phalcon/Skism


Deadpool is a non-resident,non-overwriting, encrypting .COM file infector

Files infected by Deadpool will increase in size by 560 bytes.

Deadpool will first search for a .COM file in the current directory, 
if none is found there it will jump up one directory.  Is no COM files 
are there it, will keep searching upwards until it reaches the root 
directory.  In the root directory it will once again attempt to infect 
a one .COM file.  If still none are found it will jump to the first 
directory (no matter if it is hidden or read-only) and attempt to find 
an uninfected .COM file. 

Deadpool will infect any "real" .COM file (not missnamed .EXE's) with 
any attributes. It will not change the files date, time, or attributes 
after infection. Meaning a hidden, read-only .COM file will again be a 
hidden, read-only .COM file after infection takes place. 

The virus uses a form of encryption that allows for a possible of 25,404 
different viral strains. 

I will not disclose what Deadpool does on activation, but let me just 
assure you it is not distructive. 

CASE STUDY: The Doomsday Virus 


The following is the original documentation by the author of the 
Doomsday virus: 

The Doomsday virus is a parasitic, non-resident, self-encrypting, COM 
infector.  It is EXTREMELY damaging when it activates.

The virus attachs itself to the end of host COM files.  When an 
infected program is executed, the virus will search the root directory 
of the current drive for an uninfected COM file.  If the drive is 
bootable, this will almost always be COMMAND.COM.  If no uninfected 
COM file is found in the root directory, the virus will then search 
the current directoy.  If no uninfected files can be found in the 
current directory, then the date is checked.  If the date happens to 
be the 29th day of any month, the virus will activate.  As long as a 
file can be infected, the virus will not activate. 

Upon activation, (most likely when you boot the computer as 
COMMAND.COM should have been one of the first files infected), the 
virus will start reading in logical sectors from the current drive.  
These sectors will then be XOR'ed in memory and written back to their 
original locations on the disk. This effectively destroys EVERYTHING 
on the disk.  This continues until the entire disk is encrypted.  
Partially throught the destruction process (beyond the point of no 
return), a message is displayed alerting the user to his situation. 

This virus employs a simple but effective encryption mechanism, making 
every infection different from one another.  The only common code 
between infections is a short, 15 byte de-encryptor code.  This is 
what the included SCAN string searches for. 

WARNING!!  This zip file contains a live virus.  It was created for 
educational study of viral action.  DO NOT DISTRIBUTE.  For research 
purposes only.  The author cannot be held responsible for misuse of 
this program. 


Have fun but BE CAREFUL!
CASE STUDY: The Screaming Fist Virus

The following is the author's documentation on this virus:

Screaming Fist Virus
By Lazarus Long
of SKISM/PWL

ALIASES: EMF

Screaming Fist is a resident, non-encrypting infector of .COM and .EXE 
files. It becomes resident only once at the top of memory, reserving 
only 1k for itself. Most people will never notice that they are 
missing it. Immediately upon becoming resident, it attempts to infect 
C:\COMMAND.COM, almost assuring it's continued survival. After that, 
it will infect files when they are opened, executed, renamed, or on 
attribute change. It is similar in these respects to the Dark Avenger 
virus, but is only 1/3 the size. All infected programs will run as 
they normally would. COM files increase by 711 bytes and EXE's 
increase by that amount plus a little to fill out the page boundary on 
the file. 

The virus will infect through any attributes, and restore them upon 
infection. The file date and time will not change. The virus also 
covers up all critcal errors such as a write protected disk. 

If you are debugging this virus, be very careful. You may infect your 
debugger, or your COMMAND.COM, and forget about it. Sooner or later, 
you would wonder why all your programs were just a little bit 
bigger.(Hmmm?) 

It will not reinfect files, unlike Jeru-B and it's variants. 

For some reason, most of the files I have tested this with that use 
overlays (Such as PcShell and Telemate) do not want to run after being 
infected. If anyone out there could offer a little advice on the 
subject, I'd be very grateful. Until then, later on........

CASE STUDY: The Screaming Fist IV Virus

Documentation by an unknown author

 
 
Virus Name:  Screaming Fist IV
Aliases:     EMF, Stranger, Enemy
Symptoms:    .COM and .EXE growth, Partition table modified
Origin:      Columbia, South Carolina
Eff Length:  927 Bytes
Type Code:   Parasitic Resident Encrypting .COM and .EXE Infector
Detection Method:  None at the moment
Removal Instructions:  Delete infected files, low level format HD

When an infected program is first run, the virus first checks to see 
if it has previously infected the partition table on the C drive. If 
it has not, it copies the old partition table to Head 0, Track 0, 
Sector 4 of drive C. It then overwrites it's code on top of the old 
partition table, and stores an unecrypted copy of itself at physical 
sectors 2 and 3 of the C drive. It does not become resident at this 
time. On the next reboot the virus will become resident at the top of 
memory, but below the 640k barrier. On systems with 640k, this will 
usually be at segment 9F40. It then hooks INT 21, INT 13, and INT 1C. 
It will then infect both .COM or .EXE files on open, attribute change, 
execute, or rename. It infects COM files by adding itself to the end 
of the original code, and then adding a jump at the beginning of the 
file. Infected COM files can be identified by seeing if the fourth 
byte of the file is one less than the second byte. It infects EXE 
files by padding the file out to a 512 byte multiple, and then adding 
it's code at that position. When in memory, the partition table 
infection will not be able to be seen, as the virus re-directs all 
access to the infected table back to the original one. The virus does 
perform self encryption, however, it is nothing very complicated. It 
is a simple XOR method that alternates between two methods of changing 
the encryption key. 

As of this date, the Screaming Fist IV virus has no activation of any 
sort. 

To remove the virus, first boot off a clean floppy, and then copy 
sector Head 0, Track 0, Sector 4 back to Head 0, Track 0, Sector 1. 
Then remove all infected files from your hard drive. 

CASE STUDY: The Omega Virus 

This information was written by Rizwi of the Infodesk BBS, The Hague:

   Virus Name:  Omega Virus
      Aliases:  ---
    Discovery:  December 1991
         Type:  Non-Resident .COM infector
       Origin:  Germany
   Eff Length:  440 Bytes

Detection:

F-Prot 2.01 or INOC440 for both detection and removal or HTSCAN/TBSCAN 
with the next signature for detection only: 

        ;
        Omega Virus
        COM
        7244B440B903008D562BCD217238B440B9B501
        ;

General Comments:

The Omega Virus was received in December 1991 from Germany where it is 
believed to be widespreaded. The virus is a non-resident com-files 
infector. 

The virus-code with a length of 440 bytes is placed in at the end of 
the file. 

When an infected file is executed, the virus will infect all non-
infected com-files in the current directory which have a length below 
61441 bytes. When all com-files in the current directory are infected, 
the virus will move on to the directories below the current one. The 
virus will only go one sub-directory down-below the current one. 

If all com-files in the current directory and the first level sub-
directories below the current are infected, the virus will restart its 
procedure from the root-directory from the first harddisk. 

Omega spreads fast, but it will not be unnoticed as on excecution of 
an infected program, the disktime access is much longer as it normally 
would be. Also, files can be protected against this virus by setting 
the read-only bit on files. 

When the virus has done its infective job, it will get the current 
date. If the current date is the original Friday the 13th, it will 
write the Omega character to the screen (ASCII 234) and overwrite the 
first two sectors of the first harddisk.
