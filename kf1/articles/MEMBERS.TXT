I got alot of E-Mails from peoplez all over the world who asked my how to become a Kefrens member.
The answer is very easy ! You are a virus coder ? You are interesting in joining a small but
a powerfull VX-Team ? You are interesting in teamwork ?
Interesting in writing arcticles for e-zines ? Interesting in teaching other Groupmembers / VX´ers ? 
Interressting in learning from other Groupmembers / VX´ers ? You have a personal coding style ? 
You can send us some of your virus creations + sourcecodes ?

If you are able to answer the most of the questions with a clear "Yes!" you are our man / woman !
Plz don´t understand this wrong. You don´t have to be an advanced coder to join the kefrens group.
Just someone who has a little bit coding experience and a handfull of good ideas for new creations.
Do you think you are one of them ? Write us an E-Mail, include some private stuff ...
Where do you come from ? How old are you ? Hobbys ? what are you doing with your computer ? only VX ? or
whatever you wanna tell us about you. The most important thing: add some of your virus creations and sourcecodes.

We will answer every e-mail we got !
