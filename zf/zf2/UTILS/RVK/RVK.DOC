      ฤออ[  1 SYNOPSIS  ]ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออฤ


       This is  a utility  that will step through a polymorph (MtE, NED,
       DSME, DSCE,  ViCE, TPE,  SPE, G2, PS_MPC...) decryptor or just an
       ordinary (unencrypted)  virus and  decrypts and  cleans the virus
       from the  infected file.  This process will restore the host pro-
       gram, disable the virus and cut parts out off the virus. RVK then
       terminates before executing the virus!



      ฤออ[  2 ABOUT THE PROGRAM  ]อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออฤ


       This program  is useful if you have an infected file and you want
       to remove  the virus. Just clean it using RVK, then check the re-
       sulting file.  RVK isolates viral code in an infected program and
       disables it.  From then  on it  will be  safe to  use the program
       again, as the risk of other files being infected or damaged by it
       will have been securely disabled.



      ฤออ[  3 ABOUT THE CLEANING PROCESS  ]ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออฤ


       RVK works  completely different  compared to  the  'conventional'
       cleaners. First  of all, it does not recognise any particular vi-
       rus. However  RVK is aware of many tricks used by common viruses.
       Its disinfection  scheme is  therefore completely  different from
       known cleaners  and it  works with  almost any  (COM) virus. This
       technique is  called heuristic  cleaning mode!  In that  cleaning
       mode RVK  does not need any information about viruses either, but
       it has  the added  advantage that it does not even care about the
       original, uninfected  state of  a program.  This cleaning mode is
       very effective if your program is infected with an unknown, a po-
       lymorphic or with a virus using 80386+ instructions!

       Note that this does not imply that the cleaned file is 100% equal
       to the  original one.  When RVK uses heuristic cleaning to disin-
       fect the  program, the  file will never be exactly the same as in
       its original  state. This is not an indication of failure of RVK,
       nor does it mean the file is still infected in some way. First of
       all, it is normal that the heuristic cleaned file is still larger
       than the  original one. This is normal because RVK tries to be on
       the safe  side and  it will avoid removing too much from the host
       program. The  bytes left  at the end of the file are 'dead' code,
       the instructions  will never  be executed again, since the 'jump'
       at the  beginning of the program has been removed. The functiona-
       lity of  the cleaned file will nevertheless be the same! For this
       reason a  virus scanner MAY find still the virus in cleaned files
       - or will now report a new variant of this virus (F-Prot)!

       In the heuristic mode, RVK loads the infected file and starts em-
       ulating, simulating  and tracing  the program  code to  find  out
       which part  of the file belongs to the original program and which
       to the  virus. The  result is  successful if the functionality of
       the original  program is  restored, and  the functionality of the
       virus has  been reduced  to zero.  When used, RVK will attempt to
       follow the  execution of the program until the end of the decryp-
       tor or  if the  original entry point is restored by the virus! It
       will not execute dangerous interrupt calls, and will terminate if
       one is  encountered. Some interrupt calls will be simulated, some
       emulated, a few will be executed (e.g. "get DOS version" or virus
       installation check)  and some will be removed! It also terminates
       if DS  and ES  change, or if a far call is encountered. THIS DOES
       NOT ABSOLUTELY  GUARANTEE SAFETY  WHEN RUN!  The viruses  I  have
       tested RVK  on are over 600 COM infectors! One possible time when
       RVK may  go to  pass the  cleaning process is when the virus does
       not actually restore the host program - instead trying to go res-
       ident or  to infect  other victims. Please send me any virus that
       can not  be killed  with RVK!  If possible  I will improve RVK to
       clean this virus too.



      ฤออ[  4 MULTIPLE INFECTIONS AND ANTIDEBUGGING TRICKS  ]ออออออออออฤ


       It is  possible that  the infected file is infected with multiple
       viruses, or  multiple instances  of the  same virus! Some viruses
       keep on infecting files, and in such case the infected files will
       keep growing  (e. g.  Jerusalem). It  is very likely that RVK re-
       moves only  one instance of the virus. In this case, it is neces-
       sary to repeat the cleaning process until RVK reports that it can
       not remove  anything any more. Remember that you cannot clean COM
       files protected  with PROTECT  or HackStop  due to  the fact that
       this code uses antidebugger techniques. You can remove safely en-
       cryption added  by SCRAMBLE,  CRYPTCOM or R-Crypt instead! By the
       way, RVK  can by-pass  the most anti-debugger tricks found in ex-
       isting viruses, packers and scramblers!



      ฤออ[  5 A LITTLE WARNING  ]ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออฤ


       This is  a prototype version, and is NOT IN ANY WAY GUARANTIED! I
       am only  releasing this program because to this date nothing else
       seems to be able to do this (apart from TBCLEAN). This will allow
       anyone to  be able to disinfect COM files. As an advantage RVK is
       not limited  to 8086  code, it will even clean viruses which will
       use 80586+  instructions (remember: you CAN NOT CLEAN 386 code on
       a 286  machine)! Send  me ANY  virus that could not be cleaned by
       using RVK!

      ฤออ[  6 LEGAL TERMS AND DISCLAIMER  ]ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออฤ


       RVK basically  has no  legal guarantee  and warranty because I do
       not want to get sued over it, and should be used "as is". Here is
       the official disclaimer:

       RVK ("program")  will ALTER  and DESTROY executable files and may
       have or  cause compatibility  problems with them (that is why YOU
       should keep a backup file, in case of incompatibility with a par-
       ticular file)  in certain  circumstances. Under  no circumstances
       may Ralph  Roth ("author")  be held liable or accountable for any
       damage to  system files,  executable files,  data files,  or  any
       other system  or data damage due to use or misuse of his program.
       The author  also may  not be held accountable for loss of profits
       or for  any other  damages incurred  by the  use or misuse of his
       program. The author has forewarned any users that damage to files
       may occur with use or misuse of his program, and in executing the
       program, the  user fully  understands these  risks and  this dis-
       claimer.

      ฤออ[  7 HISTORY  ]อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออฤ



      7.1 Version 0.01-0.05

      Now RVK  prompts you  only for  a filename _IF_ the virus has been
      safely decrypted  or disabled!  This means  although, that you can
      now overwrite the old file at your own risk. RVK no emulates a lot
      of MS-DOS  calls to  handle many more viruses! "Anti Debugger Code
      Handling" improved!


      7.2 Version 0.10

      RVK can  now be  invoked via commandline else you will be prompted
      for a  source file!  RVK now  truncates (most  of) the virus-body,
      therefore check the resulting file carefully!


      7.3 Version 0.11

      Added more code checking in order to clean the Annihilator Stealth
      viruses. RVK displays now information about the cleaned file. Some
      (dangerous) instructions  are now  additionally  overwritten  with
      NOP's, therefore check your cleaned files carefully!


      7.4 Version 0.13

      Added more anti-debugging tricks checking. Tested with over 50 new
      viruses.


      7.5 Version 0.20 (March 95)

      Added a  software emulator  that is  able to emulate INT calls and
      most  anti  debugger  tricks  without  loosing  control  over  the
      program! RVK  can now handle almost all files, except some special
      anti debugging code. Furthermore the handling of infected files is
      now safer, more reliable and more successful than ever before!

      7.6 Version 0.21 (April 95)

      My FAX  number has changed! Little code enhancements to clean more
      viruses!

      7.7 Version 0.22 (June 95)

      The program  is now  able to  by-pass some  IN/OUT  commands.  The
      package now  includes an  alpha version  of the  heuristic scanner
      "RPCATCH".

      7.8 Version 0.23 (December 95)

      Fixed some orthographical errors in RVK.COM.

      7.9 Version 0.24 (February 96)

      The code  emulator can  now handle  the POP  SS/POPF  antidebugger
      trick. Credits  goes to  L. Vrtik & J. Valky for pointing out this
      trick, as well as supplying me sample code.

      7.10 Version 1.20 (March 96)

      Added the handling of 386++ commands. For this reason you will
      need at least a 386 SX to run the program! Changed the version
      number to 1.20 (now the same as DECOM). The code emulator can now
      handle another antidebugger trick. Credits goes to L. Vrtik & J.
      Valky for pointing out this trick, as well as supplying me sample
      code. Excluded the RPCatch program from the package.

      7.11 Version 1.21 (March 96)

      The code emulator can now handle another antidebugger trick.
      Credits goes to L. Vrtik & J. Valky for pointing out this trick,
      as well as supplying me sample code. Added the "TBClean Bug" from
      VLAD #6 to the emulator, as well as another antidebugger trick
      found in the GOL-Wanted virus, which hinder RVK to clean infected
      files. Credits goes for this goes to Martin Roesler.

      7.11 Version 1.22 (April 96)

      The code emulator can now handle GS: and FS: segment override anti
      debugging tricks. Credits goes to L. Vrtik & J. Valky for pointing
      out this trick, as well as supplying me sample code. Added the
      handling of protected mode debugging tricks, using the CR and DR
      registers.

      7.12 Version 1.23 (July 96)

      The code emulator can now handle the PUSHFD/POPFD anti debugging
      trick and other 32 bit anti debugger tricks. Credits goes to
      Rand0m^X-Adi for pointing out this trick.

      7.13 Version 1.24 (December 96)

      Minor small bugfixes. Fixed some typos in the DOC. Added an
      interrupt 3 emulator. Added code to handle anti-emulator code
      found in the Grief.3584 and ANNI-VCS viruses. Now the program
      displays the last IP Counter, the AX value and the opcode of the
      latest instruction if the emulating process failed. This is useful
      to find out why and where the emulations process has been
      interfered.

      7.14 Version 1.25 (10 August 97) and version 1.26 (15 February 98)

      Minor code and documentation changes. Version 1.25 was released on
      the VIRUS.GER CD-ROM (published by VHM). The Cicatrix cumulative
      update January 1998 contains this version along with tons of
      viruses. To avoid speculations if this is version was hacked or
      infected this new version is released instead!
