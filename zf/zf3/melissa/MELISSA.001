The Federal Bureau of Investigation is on the trail of
VicodinES -- the code writer linked to the Melissa virus.

 Two Web sites with connections to Melissa --
SourceOfKaos.com and Codebreakers.org -- have been shut
down, allegedly at the behest of the FBI, according to
the sites' Webmasters and sources at the hosting Internet
service providers. A third virus site -- coderz.net --
also was down Wednesday, apparently having decided to
drop out of sight before the FBI came calling.

The FBI would not comment on the shutdowns.

SourceOfKaos.com system administrator Roger Sibert, who
spoke to the FBI after the Bureau seized his Web server,
said the agent's questions centered mainly on VicodinES.
"They asked me if I know VicodinES, and if I had any way
of contacting him," he said.

SPo0Ky, the Webmaster of Codebreakers.org said in an e-
mail interview: "A friend who works for
GlobalConnection.net (that's the ISP which was hosting
our site) just told me that the FBI visited them and that
he had to delete the site."

Sites linked to Melissa
Both Codebreakers.org and SourceOfKaos.com have been
connected to the Melissa macro virus via an electronic
fingerprint derived from a serial number found in
documents created with Microsoft Word and other Office
applications.


CyberCrime's Luke Reiter reports on VicodinES

Two viruses -- Shiver and PSD2000, created by virus
writers with the handles ALT-F11 and VicodinES --
contained the same electronic fingerprint as the Melissa
virus. ALT-F11 was a member of the Codebreakers virus
exchange, or VX, while VicodinES had a Web site hosted on
the SourceOfKaos.

SourceOfKaos seized
The FBI seized the SourceOfKaos Web server on Tuesday
afternoon. The server -- housed with Access Orlando, an
Orlando, Fla.-based ISP -- was taken into custody by
local field agents, pending a complete analysis of its
contents. Until late Monday, a VicodinES home page could
be accessed from the SourceOfKaos domain.

According to Dan Merillat, an Access Orlando
administrator, an agent from the FBI's New York office
contacted the ISP and asked that the SourceOfKaos server
be removed from the Internet and preserved as evidence
until a search warrant was obtained.

As further documentation, Merillat said, the FBI sent a
fax to Access Orlando directing it to "take all steps
necessary to preserve all records and other evidence in
the possession of www.sourceofkaos.com."

Following the seizure, SourceOfKaos's Sibert contacted
Access Orlando, then the FBI's New York office. Sibert
said the FBI agent he spoke to "asked me if I was willing
to volunteer to let them come in and mirror the server
tonight." Although he agreed, Sibert said the agents
ultimately decided not to examine the server until a
search warrant could be obtained.

VicodinES e-mail
Sibert has previously said he had no means of contacting
VicodinES. He said his last contact was on Jan. 11, when
he received an e-mail from the virus writer. A copy of
the message, forwarded by Sibert, suggests that VicodinES
was leaving his chosen vocation.

In the message, VicodinES wrote: "Hey just wanted to
thank you for the use of your webspace. I have decided to
quit my hobby. If you could take my dir [sic] down [/vic]
and kill this pop3 it would be greatly appreciated."

The message, signed "Vic," appears to have been routed
from an ISP on the East Coast of the United States.
Sibert offered that information to the FBI agent, but the
agent said the agent was way ahead of him. "They (the
FBI) already knew that this guy was using that ISP," he
said.

Codebreakers not 'illegal'
Suspicion fell on Codebreakers.org after files on that
site matched electronic fingerprints within the Melissa
virus. In addition, the writer of the Syndicate variant
of the Melissa virus thanked Codebreakers.org in comments
found within the Syndicate macro code.

"I don't know and understand what gave them the right to
shut the site down," SPo0Ky said. "We did absolutely
nothing illegal by just providing (virus) information."

Dennis Halsey, vice president and CEO of Global
Connection Internet Inc., denied that the company had
been contacted by the FBI. The ISP took down the site,
because "we had two e-mails sent to us that complained
that (codebreakers.org) was spreading viruses," he said.
One e-mail came from a "West Coast company," while the
other came from a source that Halsey would not identify.

Halsey did admit that the Webmaster -- a student who "is
a young fella, at least 16-years-old" -- was a friend of
his partner, James Hall, the president and senior
hardware specialist at Global Connection. "They had a
special arrangement," he said. "But I swear we didn't
think -- and still don't -- that anything illegal was
going on."

Coderz.net closed
On coderz.net, a message employing the liberal
grammatical rules favored by Net jockeys said it was
"temporarily closed due to recent development." It went
on to say that "there are no viruses here, there is no
source code here, there is not any reason for you, mr.
fbi to be lookin here,,,, go away law-man."

It then added "ohh,,, btw, coderz had nuffin at all to do
with melissa" and linked visitors to "someone who did" --
MSN.
