40Hex Number 6 Volume 2 Issue 2                                       File 000


    Welcome to 40Hex issue 6.  If this is your first time reading an issue of
40 Hex, I welcome you, but recommend that you start with an earlier issue.
This issue will have a Virus Spotlite on Creeping Death(Dir-2).  It isn't in
the normal Hex Dump format, and it is fully commented.

   - Landfill is temporarily down(again!).  This is due to several [NuKEd]
     hard drive controllers...  we are down but NOT out.  Hopefully we should be
     up within several weeks of the release of this issue.  Hellraiser is still
     unable to edit the magazine, hopefully next issue he will be back in
     charge.

   - I think we must discuss one problem.  Recently, we have been verbally
     "attacked" by some lamers in the virus scene who like to jerk off on
     Fidonet.  To clear up the issue at hand, we personally don't use all of
     the methods found in the articles.  For example, we don't sit around all
     day and PKLite infected files and then remove the PKLite header.  We let
     you people do it.  As a matter of fact, we made it a hell of a lot easier
     due to this month's article called NoLite.  No self-respecting virus
     group would do it.  Not everyone that reads this magazine is a virus
     programmer, but wants to learn.  Ya gotta start somewhere.  Another person
     who has been insulting us on FidoNet is Sara Gordon.  I do not know the
     whole story behind her hatred, but I know it stems from a phone
     conversation between her and Hellraiser.  From what I understand, they
     disagreed on many topics, and HR may have gotten insulting (I don't
     know the whole story)

   - Anyone that would like to submit articles feel free to do so, as long as
     what you write is not stolen from another source and is of good quality.
     If you would like to write articles contact any PHALCON/SKISM member or
     upload them to either Digital Warfare or PHUN LINE.

P.S.  The transcript of the Alliance mentioned in last issue will NOT be

large file.  It will be put into 40Hex-7, if we aren't in jail.
