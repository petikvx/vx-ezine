40Hex Number 6 Volume 2 Issue 2                                       File 005


                I'm back, well kind of.  Anyways, a lot of people have been
asking, "What's going on with the group?" The question should be, "What's going
on with any group these days?" It seems to me that 1992 was the death of h/p,
or at least the "ice age" of it.  Everybody was either getting busted or
quitting the scene.  Oh well, what can I say about it.  Our group has been
having bad luck too.  Five (now six) busted as well as other assorted bad
things happening to members.

                Anyways, what's going on with us, huh?.  Well the reason you
haven't heard much from us is because we haven't been releasing our new stuff
to BBS systems ( BBS system sounds as redundant as PIN number, I know) because
we have a strong feeling that members of such groups as the CVIA are logging on
to h/p boards in the hope of snatching the latest viruses.  Well not much you
can do about it if you run a BBS, unless you personnally know everyone who calls
your board. But come to think of it - what good does it prove to release your
newest creation to the general public (of the h/p crowd) via BBS system?  Isn't
that the same principle as the warez puppy scene?  I guess you all can do
whatever turns you on but we kind of decided that it would be in our best
interests to release our stuff to BBS's only after they have been detected by
the popular scanners or until they are kind of old.  Not to fear, 40-HEX and
"Dark Angel Phunky Writing Guide" will still be on boards at the same rate as
always.

                As for all of you people bitching that no longer have sites
and that we are dead, well your dead - wrong.  The current sites are as follows
(in no specific order) - Digital Warfare (yes it's back, at a new number
however), Time Lords BBS (The U.S.S.R System), The Phunline (yes it's back),
and the newest addition - Crow Technology.  And as for us being dead yeah
right.

** Note from DecimatoR:
The U.S.S.R System recently went down, due to Time Lord getting into a little
hot water.  It WILL return however... we're just not sure when. **

** Note from GHeap:
I am coming back, gimme mo' time!

                So now with that out of the way, on the other news.  Hmmm.....
Michelangelo caused quite a scare there for a while.  It was pretty cool
to see John, Patti, and the rest of the crew on T.V... John Dvorak has a new
half hour computer talk show on syndicated radio.  I'm sure he wouldn't mind if
we got on the show some time soon.  Check your local radio guide for your local
station and time... I am offering a standing bounty of $1,500 for the person
willing to fly to Ohio and kick Crow Meisters ass for good.  A minor would be
preferred, being that he is under 18 and if I smashed him I could get sued or
something.  Just kidding, Crow Meister is cool with me, hihihihi... A new
federal law is being considered which if passed will outlaw the authorship of
computer viruses totally, research or not.  Read more about that later in this
issue... Hey, I might have a BBS up soon!  I have been saying that for the past
2 years haven't I?  Well that's the news as I see it, it's nice to be writing
for this rag again. 

        Check ya in 25 to life....

                                                        Hellraiser P/S
