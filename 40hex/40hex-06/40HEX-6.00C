                        ------------------------
                             Virus Contest!
                           'The Spammies(tm)'
                        ------------------------
                        Deadline: July 4th, 1992


   This is the first PHALCON/SKISM virus contest.  As a matter of fact, this
is the first contest of its kind.  We believe that it will motivate you to
produce more original code, rather than more hacks.  Winners may have already
won $10,000,000, as well as the prestige of winning the first ever 'Spammie'
awards.


Rules and Regulations:
1)  All submissions must be original source code. (no hacks)
2)  Only one submission is allowed per programmer, plus one group project.
3)  All viruses must be recieved by us before July 4th, 1992.
4)  Viruses must be accompanied by a complete entry form. (see below)
5)  The original, compilable, commented source MUST be included, along with an
    installer program, or a dropper, in the case of boot block viruses.
6)  Entries must include a location where the author may be contacted, such as
    an email address or a BBS.
7)  Personnel or persons related to personnel of PHALCON/SKISM are not
    eligable.
8)  The source must compile without error under Tasm or Masm (please specify
    what assembler and version you used, along with the necessary command line
    switches).  If we cannot compile your virus, it will be disqualified.
9)  All entries recieve a free subscription to 40hex.  (hehehehe)
10) The entry must be uploaded privately to the sysop, stating that it is a
    contest entry.
11) The viruses must not be detectable by the current version (as of July 4th)
    of any known virus scanner.
12) Viruses will be judged by our 'panel of experts' in three catagories.
    6.1)  Stealth
    6.2)  Size
    6.3)  Reproductivity
    6.4)  Performance
        For example, Red Cross is an example of a 'high performance' virus.  It
        was entertaining and well done.
