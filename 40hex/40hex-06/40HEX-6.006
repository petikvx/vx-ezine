    Well, this little news "tid-bit" came from Attitude Adjuster, one of the
 few non-PHALCON/SKISM contributers (ok, the ONLY non P/S member), Thanks a
 lot dude, keep the submissions coming.  The article itself is quite sad,
 and makes me question the intelligence of our opposition.

 ============================================================================        
         Millions  of computer users are wondering how to protect themselves
 against  the wave of viruses that are threatening their machines. I have  a
 suggestion.[So do I, avoid Bnu 1.90Beta]
         First, they  should  remember  that these viruses don't spring from
 nature. They  are  little  computer  programs  that are created and sent on
 their  way  by people  that are brainy,  malicious and  arrogant.[I am  not
 brainy]
         So,  the  question is,  how  do you  find  the creators of computer
 virus programs?
         Because  they are  arrogant, it's  likely that they want someone to
 know what a clever thing they have done. They won't hold a press conference
 [Actually, we do hold press conferences.  See Michael Alexander@Computerworld]
 but  chances  are they  will brag  to a  trusted friend  or acquaintance or
 fellow hacker.
         It is sad, but the world is full of snitches.[Get a thesaurus] Look
 at John Gotti,  the nation's  biggest Mafia boss.  There was a time when it
 was  unthinkable for  even the lowest-level Mafia soldier to blab.  But now
 Gotti has to sit in court while his former  right-hand  man tells about how
 they got people whacked.  [We whack people too]
         So if Mafia  figures can be persuaded to tattle[Na-na-na-na-na], is
 there any reason  to believe that nerds  have a greater  sense of honor and
 loyalty?  [Yes, we also have brains]
        Of course[.] not, but how do you get them to do it?

        Money. [Now yer talking... my mom is really the Dark Avenger, I want
 my money now.]

        These  companies [what companies,  I only  hit hospitals]  could use
 petty cash  to place  ads in the  computer magazines and on  the electronic
 bulletin boards.  [Ok, call my BBS and  post this tidbit.  40Hex now has ad
 space available]
        The  ads  would  say  something  like: "A  $50,000  reward  for  any 
 information leading to the arrest and conviction of virus authors."
 [How can you convict a virus author. It isn't illegal.  Go play Tank Wars.]
        The  next question  would be  what to  do with the virus makers once
 they  have been  caught. And  that's  the  key  to putting  an  end to  the
 problem:  something  that could  be  posted  on  those electronic  bulletin
 boards  that  might cause  an aspiring  virus-maker to go take a brisk walk
 instead.
         A judge  would sit  and listen  to an  attorney who would say some-
 thing like this:
         "Your  honor,  what we  have here  is an  otherwise  fine young man
 from  a good  family. His  father is  a brilliant scholar, and the son will
 someday be the same."[I am going to be a certified scholar when I grow up.]
         "What  he did  was no  more than  an intellectual prank, a cerebral
 challenge of  sorts. Like  the man who climbed Mount Everest because it was
 there, he created the virus and sent it fourth because it was there."
         Then, we can hope, the judge might say something like this:
         "Yes,  I am  impressed  by  the  defendant's  brain  power.  And  I
 expected you to ask me to give him a slap on the wrist."
         "However,  he  is  not  a child.  He is an adult. And I would think
 that  so  brilliant a  grown  man would  know better  than to amuse himself
 by screwing with the lives of strangers."  [I haven't screwed one stranger]
         "It's  as if  he hid  inside  the businesses and institutions until
 they  were closed  and  everyone had  gone home. Then  he came out and went
 through  every  filing cabinet  and drawer and shredded or burned every bit
 of useful information he could find."[Cool! Lets try it.]
         "Now,  counselor, what  would you and your law partners say is some
 street mope [See Thesaurus] did that  to your firm - crept in and destroyed
 every document in your offices? Including the names of clients that owe you
 money. Hah, you would be in here asking me to hang him from a tree."[I love
 hanging from trees]
         "So  don't  give  me that  smart  kid  from  a good family routine.
 [I ain't smart, and family ain't good] He is a self-centered,  insensitive,
 uncaring,  arrogant goofball  [And  damn proud].  He didn't  give a  second
 thought to the  chaos or  heartbreak he would  cause an adoption  agency, a
 hardworking businessman or a medical clinic." [Yes I did.  I aim for them.]
         "Therefore,  I sentence him  to the maximum sentence the law allows
 in the local jailhouse [0, NUL, ZIP-o, /dev/null, etc..], which is a really
 terrible place, filled with all sorts of crude, insensitive hulks."
 [Jay-walkers]
         "Bailiff,  please get the defendent up off the floor and administer 
 some smelling salts."[More like, why is the defendant laughing?]
         "And change his trousers, quickly."[Fuck you]

                I hope you enjoyed that one as much as I did! Okay, I
        see some really neat things with this man's article. First off,
        I'm sure he's an adept programmer... that is, he can probably
        figure out how to get his VCR to tape something while he is
        off writing his brilliant articles. I enjoy his narrow-minded
        definition of virii (that was mentioned in 40Hex 5), of course,
        all virii are those evil overwriting, trigger date, resident,
        boot track infecting swine (yeah, he probably learned what a
        virus was from watching ABC News covering the Michaelangelo
        crisis!)
                I also enjoy his opinion that all virus authors are
        nerds.  First off, what the hell is a nerd?  I mean, I have
        written a virus before (not saying it was any good), but, I
        don't feel like a nerd!  In fact, I feel quite superior to
        most of the idiots like this guy.  And, I like his great
        statement about my loyalty.  Yes, I'm gonna narc on [PHALCON/
        [Forget this again, and die]]SKISM for $50,000!!! Yeah, right.
        There are a lot of narcs on this not-so good earth, so choose
        your friends wisely.
                I'm quite sure that ads on BBS's (electronic bulletin
        boards! No... cork ones!) would just sufficiently pump up user
        discussion of virii.  I'm not scared of fed intervention, and
        I doubt any authors I know are either.
                This was touched on in 40Hex 5, virus authors are not
        responsible for the spread of their virii unless they are
        actively spreading them!  I mean, it's not my fault that K-Rad
        Man sent my Hard Drive Blender (slices, dices, minces sectors)
        to 1000 Bible boards in Utah. Apparently it hasn't dawned on
        this guy that most virii are not written to be destructive.
        Actually, that's a lie.  There are a lot of virii out there that
        are descructive, but that is changing.  People like the
        PHALCON/SKISM crew realize that not everything must be
        destructive, opening the doors to much larger virus projects
        (ie Bobisms)
                One more thing... QUIT EQUATING THE WORD 'hacker' TO
        EVERY DAMN TYPE OF ELECTRONIC 'crime!!!'


                I'm gonna get this dude's phone #, I say we call him
        sometime...
