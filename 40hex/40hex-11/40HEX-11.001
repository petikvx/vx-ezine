40Hex Issue 11 Volume 3 Number 2                                      File 001

                        Life, the Universe, and 40Hex

       It is apparent to even the blindest of observers that the virus
  phenomenon has caught on.  Everyone and his kid brother has decided to start
  a virus group, whether or not they have programmers capable of creating a
  viable (read: parasitic) virus.  While this in itself is merely offensive,
  it is the sheer arrogance of these meta-groups which is irritating.  Of
  course, no names will be mentioned, as that would be mean and we all wish
  for a happy world.
       The most common trait of these pseudo-groups is for a member to state
  that all code that was written was "developed on my own."  Of course, this
  is seldom the case.  Often, the "original source code" to their viruses
  clearly originated at some point from a Sourcer disassembly.  Heck, when you
  see "seg_a" or "loc_0027," you know they're just poor hacks.  Of course, the
  the disparate coding styles in the "source" also reveals the nature of the
  virus.
       And when the virus is listed as a Dark Avenger hack in various anti-
  virus products, the individuals persist in their self-induced fantasies,
  saying their viruses are original.  I suppose the anti-virus programmers,
  who have disassembled countless viruses, can't spot a Dark Avenger or Murphy
  hack when they see one.  Stop fooling yourselves.
       And these mentally challenged persons continue, insisting routine X, a
  "new, innovative technique," was developed independently.  Yet anyone with
  even a minimal exposure to virus source code can see traces of other viruses
  in these routines.  Even the ideas presented are seldom new; most having
  already been implemented by existing viruses.  The worst of these people
  magnify all of their supposed accomplishments, talking of the revolutionary
  changes they single-handedly effect.
       Every group goes through a phase in which they hack viruses; they
  should not be proud of these viruses.  But it is merely the first step and
  most grow out of it.  Skism-1, for example, was a Jerusalem hack.  It is
  ancient history.  I might also point out that the Phalcon/Skism viruses
  published in both the last issue and this one are far superior to Skism-1.
  Phalcon/Skism does not release the source code to half-baked viruses just so
  40Hex can look larger.  Every virus programmer has a few experimental
  viruses; yet it is not necessarily appropriate to print all of them.  If I
  wrote a virus which had several hundred bytes of repetitious code, I would
  be ashamed to print it.  It's like releasing a program which has only been
  half-completed.
       When a virus programmer additionally claims, "This virus was written
  two years ago, so it sucks, but I'm going to release it anyway because it's
  good to learn from," I have my doubts.  When s/he further hurridly states,
  "My other viruses are better," then my doubts grow.  Where, pray tell, are
  these superior viruses?  Why publish that which you admit sucks?  Of course,
  anyone that makes such a claim, or one such as, "Next time, I'll release a
  COM/EXE/SYS/MBR/OV?/DAT/DOC/TXT/ANS/ASC polymorphic, stealth infector that I
  wrote last week," is suspicious.
       As an example of the mindless boasting, observe the following:  (Note:
  the following should not be construed as a personal attack against either
  the person or group in question.)
       This person wrote, "As with many of my routines, stuff which took many
  other virus writers a few pages of code took me one page... that's not bad!
  I have many other goodies up my sleeve, like a 387-byte generic COM/EXE
  parasitic infector on execution, the smallest of its kind in the WORLD...
  (with room for improvement!)."
       Please do not boast if you cannot substantiate your claims.  For
  example, these claims are easily shredded by counterexample.  Let us examine
  the Voronezh-370 virus.  It is a generic parasitic COM/EXE infector and it
  is indeed less than 387 bytes.  If 387 bytes is the smallest in the world,
  then this may very well be the smallest in the universe.  With only two
  hours of fiddling, I came up with the following virus (278 bytes), which may
  yet be the smallest of its kind in all of creation!  Actually, I make no
  such claim, as a smaller one _can_ be written.  The point was to show that
  this claim was not all that impressive and was, in fact, dead wrong.  Let us
  not be o'erhasty to boast next time.
       As with many of my viruses, stuff which took many other virus writers
  over 380 bytes took me under 280... that's not bad!  Humour aside, I might
  point out that this virus is _over_ 100 bytes less than the boaster's
  attempt, so it is _significantly_ smaller.  Gee, I wonder what those extra
  109 bytes are used for.

  -------------------------------------

       I think the informed virus and anti-virus person recognises these
  claims as the baseless boasts they are.  Let me assure you that you will see
  none of that in 40Hex.
       Finally, each new group proclaims to be the world's predominant virus
  group.  Each new group puts out a magazine.  Each new group presents H/P/A
  articles in their magazines.  Let us go through each one step by step.
  Hacking.  Gee, can't you see the connection with viruses?  Phreaking.  Got
  some c0deZ, d00d?  Anarchy.  Gee, I want total chaos even though I probably
  couldn't survive such a situation.  H/P/A aside, these "virus magazines" do
  indeed contain some virus-related articles.  Generally, these are of the
  form "X virus is great, but we won't give source.  X does this, it does
  that, it is not a hack of Dark Avenger even though it scans as such."  Some
  articles give Sourcer disassemblies -- hardly commented, yet termed
  disassemblies nonetheless.  Finally, there are the programming articles
  containing tips and tricks from the "masters."  These often contain
  nonworking code.  These often contain factual errors.  These often are
  nothing but a waste of time.
       Does this sound elitist?  I hope not.  Judge virus groups and their
  magazines on their merits, not on their hype.  Do not take a virus group's
  word as gospel; it seldom reflects the truth.  Instead, do some
  investigation on your own and try to verify (or refute) their claims.  You
  may be surprised at the results.  There is also no reason to immediately
  condemn all anti-virus people as corrupt and "lame"; many are just ordinary
  people "on the other side."  The virus scene is becoming less innovative as
  these new quasi-groups emerge.  This apparent contradiction must end soon.
  We ask all groups to end the self-back-patting and blatant lying and do some
  real work.
       Finally, a short summary of 40Hex is in order, for both new and old
  readers alike.  The paragraphs below show the current editorial stance and
  opinion of 40Hex, which has evolved during the several years of its
  existence.  What holds true for 40Hex also applies to Phalcon/Skism.

       40Hex is _not_ a magazine for self-congratulation.  Although put out by
  Phalcon/Skism, 40Hex serves as medium through which the public may hear the
  voice of the informed virus community without magnification of either the
  achievements or failures of any particular virus group or programmer.
  Although the 40Hex staff offers opinions from the pro-virus standpoint,
  40Hex is not an anti-anti-virus magazine.  There is a clear distinction
  between pro- and anti-anti-virus.  40Hex encourages anti-virus researchers
  to contribute.  40Hex offers a fair, unbiased view except in editorials,
  which obviously reflect the opinions of the authors.
       40Hex _is_ purely a virus magazine -- none of that H/P/A/k-rad stuff.
  Illegal and anarchistic activities are not condoned by 40Hex and, as such,
  these topics are not appropriate for inclusion in the magazine.  The public
  distribution of quality virus source code and virus writing techniques, both
  old and new, is one of the predominant goals of 40Hex, serving to inform
  both the pro- and anti-virus community.  The secondary function of the
  magazine is to spread virus-related news.  40Hex is concerned more with
  content than size.  You know the old saw "Quality, not quantity."  Other
  magazines appear larger than they truly are because each article is padded
  to 80 columns, effectively doubling its file length.
       40Hex articles are _not_ mere rehashes of what has already been
  printed.  Other magazines have presented articles which closely mirror those
  already published in 40Hex.  Such poorly rewritten articles are neither
  enlightening nor necessary.
       40Hex is _not_ a tool with which people wreak havok upon others'
  systems.  This is simply an unfair view of the magazine.  In fact, 40Hex is
  against wanton destruction of computer systems.  Viruses are so prevalent
  nowadays that anyone can obtain them with little difficulty.  They also need
  not obtain 40Hex to be able to type "FORMAT C:"  Knobs will be knobs.
       40Hex _is_ a public forum, allowing those who take the time to write to
  have their opinions published.  We encourage all to send letters to 40Hex,
  as they provide valuable insight into the virus and anti-virus communities
  from a fresh perspective.
       40Hex is _not_ inherently evil.  What you choose to do with the
  knowledge provided is your business.

       Once again, 40Hex does not condone the illegal spread of viruses.  Such
  actions are frowned upon.  Our stance has evolved over the years, so don't
  bring up something from 40Hex-2 and cry hippocrite -- unless, of course, you
  have a closed mind and absolutely nothing else to say.
