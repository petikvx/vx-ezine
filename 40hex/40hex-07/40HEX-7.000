40Hex Number 7 Volume 2 Issue 3                                       File 000

    Welcome to 40Hex issue 7!  As you may have noticed, we are a little
late in releasing this issue.  This is mainly because very little has
gone on for us to write about.  Enough of the excuses, on with the show.
We are going to start by giving you a little news update on what we've
been up to.
    First of all, Hellraiser is back in New York.  He moved back towards
the end of May.  Once he gets settled and I give him his computer, I am
sure he will be back writing more virii, and possibly editing 40Hex (not
sure if he wants the task of editing 40Hex).  Anyways, to say the
least, its great having him back where he belongs.
    Second, we have several new virii out, these will NOT appear on
Virus BBSs.  Not even ours.  The reason is simple.  Anti-Virus people
are not in the dark anymore.  They are on Virus BBSs.  Since we want our
virii to remain as undetectable as possible, giving them to the general
public is just no longer an option.  Nonetheless, the new virii will be
sure to surprise everyone.
    Third, LandFill BBS is back online.  The number won't be given out
in the mag, I don't want it getting posted on FidoNet.  I am silly that
way.  The other reason I am not putting the number in it is because I
don't want 100+ lamers reading it, and giving the BBS a call.
    Fourth, a new installment of Dark Angel's Virus Writing Guide came
out, get it, it is chunky.
    Finally, greetings to three new members, Black Mischief (Hacker), and
iNVALiD MEDiA (Hacker, SysOp Of Unphamiliar Territories, which is now
invite only!), and Stingray(Ex-VIPER).
