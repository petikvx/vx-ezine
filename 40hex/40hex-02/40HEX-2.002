                THE SAFE WAY TO EXPERIMENT WITH VIRUSES


   The problem with fooling around with viruses is that you never know
   what damage there going to do to your hard disk.  I have a couple of
   so called viruses that when run, automatically screw up the FAT on
   all the disks in the system.  Well, theres a way around getting the
   shaft from these programs, and also to experiment with legitament
   viruses.

   The key is the DOS utitlity SUBST, make this batch file, and copy it
   to a floppy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@echo off
subst d: a:\
subst c: a:\
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    What this will do is send any access to disks C: and D: (the two
    hard disks in my case) to drive A:  So the only damage inflicted
    will be to the floppy in A:

    No programs can access you hard disk when this command is issued.  I
    use it all the time and as of now it has proved 100% safe.

    Oh yeah, if you dont feel like distroying a floppy every time you
    mess with a virus, you can do this teqnique from a RAM disk.

    Have fun...
