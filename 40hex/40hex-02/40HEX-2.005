Part I.  The Dark Avenger
-------------------------

Introduction:

The following text file was sent directly to Professor
Vesselin Bontchev in a public sent to an anti-viral board
located in Sofia, Bulgaria.

Bontchev is one of the leading anti-viral researchers in
Europe today.  A producer of number of effective anti-viral
programs in Bulgaria, his programs are widely used throughout
Europe.

The Dark Avenger is Bulgaria's most dangerous viral code
writer and a heavy metal fanatic - as this message concerning
himself, written by him (often referring to himself in third
person) reveals:

----------------
 
  DARK AVENGER
  ============

  DARK AVENGER is the pseudonym used by a particularly prolific and
  malicious Bulgarian virus writer. It is also the name given in the
  West to some of his earlier viruses. His viruses include:

  DARK AVENGER V651, V1800, V2000 and V2100

  NUMBER OF THE BEAST aka 512 (several versions)

  ANTHRAX (Infects both files and boot sectors)

  V800 and its derivatives: 1226, PROUD, EVIL & PHOENIX

  Some other viruses, e.g. NOMENKLATURA & DIAMOND are in his style but
  are believed to be the work of others. MURPHY has been strongly
  influenced by him but is known to be of different authorship.
  CRAZY EDDIE may also be his.

  Several 'hacks' are now appearing of V1800, V2100, MURPHY and
  DIAMOND.

               ************* more **********

  Eddie is the mascot of the British heavy metal group, Iron Maiden
  (hence 'up the irons'). It is a 20 foot high skeleton that appears
  on stage with them and is featured on the sleeves of all their
  albums.

  Anthrax and Damage Inc are other heavy metal groups whose names have
  been featured in some Dark Avenger viruses. Iron Maiden numbers have
  also been mentioned including 'Somewhere in Time', 'Only the Good Die
  Young' and 'Number of the Beast'.

                **************  more  **********

  Unusually, this virus writer has also produced a virus removal
  program together with a version log of his EDDIE series, as
  reproduced below with its original spelling and grammar.

  "DOCTOR   QUICK!   Virus Doctor for the Eddie Virus   Version 2.01
  10-31-89 Copyright (c) 1988-89 Dark Avenger.  All rights reserved.
  DOCTOR /? for help

  It may be of interest to you to know that Eddie (also known as "Dark
  Avenger") is the most widespread virus in Bulgaria for the time
  being.  However I have information that Eddie is well known in the
  USA, West Germany and USSR too.

  I started in writing the virus in early September 1988. In those
  times there were no any viruses in Bulgaria, so I decided to write
  the first Bulgarian virus.  There were some different Eddie's
  versions:

  VERSION 1.1, 16-DEC-1988

  In December I've decided to enhance the virus.  This version could
  infect files during their opening.  For that reason, a read buffer
  was allocated in high end of memory, rather than using DOS function
  48h when needed.  The disk was destroyed instead of the infected
  files.

  VERSION 1.2, 19-DEC-1988

  This added a new feature that causes (for example) compiled programs
  to be infected at once if the virus is resident.  Also, the "Eddie
  lives..." message was added (can you guess why exactly "Eddie"?)

  VERSION 1.31, 3-JAN-1989

  This became the most common version of Eddie. A code was added to
  find the INT 13 rom-vector on many popular XT's and AT's.  Also,
  other messages were added so its length would be exactly 1800 bytes.
  There was a subsequent, 1.32 version (19-JAN-1989), which added
  self-checksum and other interesting features that was abandoned
  because it was extremely buggy.

  In early March 1989 version 1.31 was called into existence and
  started to live its own life to all engineers' and other suckers'
  terror.  And, the last

  VERSION 1.4, 17-OCT-1989

  This was a bugfix for version 1.31, and added some interesting new
  features.  Support has been added for DOS 2.x and DOS 4.x.  For
  further information about this (the most terrible) version, and to
  learn how to find out a program author by its code, or why
  virus-writers are still not dead, contact Mr. Vesselin Bontchev (All
  Rights Reserved).

  So, never say die!  Eddie lives on and on and on...  Up the irons!"

  NOTE:
  Vesselin Bontchev, who the Dark Avenger is trying to discredit, is a
  leading virus researcher at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.


Post Note:

There is a rumor concerning the fact that RABID now has
the Dark Avenger on their staff of virus writers, and that
the new Dark Avenger variant released by them was, in fact,
written by him.  This has yet to be proven.

The more acceptable belief concerning this new strain
is that RABID simply picked up the source code for Dark Avenger,
released last December, and modified it.

Part II - Dark Avenger - Strain A
          -----------------------

Vesselin Bontchev reports in May 1990:

The Dark Avenger virus.
======================

- I found two new mutations of this virus. Well, maybe
  "mutations" is not the correct word. In the first of them, the
  first 16 characters of the string "Eddie lives...  somewhere in
  time!" were replaced with blanks.

In the second example, all strings (the message above, the
copyright message and the "Diana P."  string) were replaced with
blanks.  - The author of the Dark Avenger virus (The bastard!  I
still cannot determine who he is.) has released the source code
of his virus.

It is full with ironic comments about me.  Of course, now we have
to expect lots of new, similar viruses to appear.  At least, this
leaded to one good thing - the source helped me very much in
disassembling the V2000 virus.  - I received a rather offensive
anonymous letter from this person.  In it he claims to be also
the author of both the V2000 (I trust this) and the Number of the
Beast viruses (the latter is unlikely).  [See Above]

Note:

This information is far more valuable than the standard
Virus Summary by Patricia Hoffman.  Her entry concerning DA
fails to go into more depth about the Dark Avenger virus and
apparently she has yet to receive information of the
different versions of DA.  Such information is already a year
old, but she has yet to include it.

Part III - DARK AVENGER 2000
           =================

 Date:    02 Feb 90 10:49:00 +0700
 From:    Vesselin Bontchev

  This virus is also "made in Bulgaria" and again I am indirectly the
  cause of its creation.  I am a well known "virus-buster" in Bulgaria
  and my antivirus programs are very widely used.  Of course, virus
  designers didn't like it.  So their next creation...  causes trouble
  to my antivirus programs.

  This virus is exactly 2000 bytes long and I think that it was
  created by the author of the Eddie (Dark Avenger) virus.  The
  programming style is the same and there are even pieces of code
  which are the same.

  The virus acts much like the Eddie one --- it installs resident in
  memory by manipulating the memory control blocks; infects
  COMMAND.COM at the first run; infects both .COM- and .EXE-files;
  infects files when one executes them as well as when one copies
  them.

  However, there are some extras added.  First, the virus is able to
  fetch the original INT 13h vector just like the V512 one (by using
  the same undocumented function --- tricks spread fast between virus
  programmers).

  Second, it intercepts the find-first (FCB) and find-next (FCB)
  functions --- just like V651 (aka EDDIE II) (and contains the same
  bugs), so you won't see the increased file lengths in the listing
  displayed by the DIR command.

   Third, it contains the string "Copyright (C) 1989 by Vesselin
   Bontchev", so people may think that I am the author of this virus.
   In fact, the virus searches every program being executed for this
   string (the case of the letters does not matter) and if found,
   hangs the system.  It is not necessary to tell you that all my
   antivirus programs contain this string.  Of course, now I will have
   to use some kind of encryption, just to prevent such tricks.

  Vesselin Bontchev reported in May 1990:

  The V2000 virus (DARK AVENGER 2000)
  ===================================

- It turned out that the example of this virus I sent to some of
the antivirus researchers was not the original version.  The
original contains the string "Only the Good die young..."
instead of the "Copy me - I want to travel" message.  Also a
small piece of code in the original version was patched to
contain the "666" string. (That is, the version you have contains
this string, the original does not.)

- There exists also a small mutation of the version you have.
The only difference is that the `C' character in the word "Copy"
was changed to `Z'.

- When describing the V2000 virus, I stated that it halts the
computer if you run a program which contains the string
"Copyright (c) 1989 by Vesselin Bontchev". This is not quite
correct. In fact, the programs are only checked for the "Vesselin
Bontchev" part of the string.

- I obtained John McAfee's program Clean, version 60.  In the
accompanying documentation he states about the V2000 virus that
"The virus is very virulent and has caused system crashes and
lost data, as well as causing some systems to become non-bootable
after infection".  This is not very correct, or at least, there
is much more to be said.  The virus is exactly as virulent as the
Dark Avenger virus, and for the same reason.  It infects files
not only when one executes them, but also when one reads or
copies them. This is achieved exactly in the same manner as in
the Dark Avenger.  The systems become non-bootable when the virus
infects the two hidden files of the operating system - it cannot
distinguish them from the regular .COM files.  By the way, the
Dark Avenger virus often causes the same effect.  And at last,
but not least (:-)), the virus is highly destructive - just as
the Dark Avenger is.  It destroys the information on a randomly
selected sector on the disk once in every 16 runs of an infected
program. The random function is exactly the same, and the
counters (0 to 15 and for the last attacked sector) are exactly
the same and on the same offsets in the boot sector as with the
Dark Avenger virus.  The main difference is that the destroyed
sector is overwritten not with a part of the virus body, but with
the boot sector instead.  This makes a bit more difficult to
discover which files are destroyed - the boot sector is contained
in many "good" programs, such as FORMAT, SYS, NDD.  Also, the
nastiest thing - the damage function is not performed via INT 26h
(which can be intercepted).  The virus determines the address of
the device driver for the respective disk unit (using an
undocumented DOS function call, of course.  I begin to wonder if
Ralf Brown did any good when he made the information in the
INTERxyy file available :-)).  Then it performs a direct call to
that address.  The device driver in DOS does its work and issues
the appropriate INT 13h.  However the virus has scanned the
controllers' ROM space and has determined the original address of
the interrupt handler - just as the Dark Avenger virus does.
Then it has temporary replaced the INT 13h vector with the
address of this handler.  The result is that the damage function
cannot be intercepted.

- Also this virus (unlike Dark Avenger) supports PC-DOS version
4.0 and will work (and infect) under it.

- The bytes 84 A8 A0 AD A0 20 8F 2E in the virus body are the
name "Diana P.", this time written in cyrillics.

                                                           Unknown Source
