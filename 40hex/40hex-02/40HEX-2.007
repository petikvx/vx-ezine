                      Now a word from a real dick


     When SSS told me how much of a dick this guy I'm about to tell you
     about is I didn't belive him.  His name will be kept, because if we
     mention it he'll get all souped and think he's public enemy number
     one in the virus community.

     Who he is, is the author of a very sad anti-virus program and virus
     scanner called FLU-SHOT and VIR-X, respectivly.  What the man is,
     is a sad case who wallows in the shadow of John McAffe and curses
     to his bitter self why he is not a popular anti-virus author.  The
     reason is simple.  His product sucks.  Well lets put it this way,
     his self proclaimed 'great' scanner fails to detect over 60% of all
     viruses out there.  On top of that, it was very sinple for a
     person, who shall remain nameless, to infect his virus scanner, and
     send out trojan copies all over the USA.  The product, FLU-SHOT, is
     the most annoying, false-alarm causing, piece of trash on the
     market.   Nuff said on the subject.

     What makes us to pissed at said asshole?  Well, take into mind the
     following, from the documentation of FLU-SHOT.

             The Challenge to the Worm
        =========================

        When I first released a program to try to thwart their demented 
        little efforts, I published this letter in the archive (still in 
        the FLU_SHOT+ archive of which this is a part of).  What I say in 
        it still holds:

                    As for the designer of the virus program: most 
                    likely an impotent adolescent, incapable of 
                    normal social relationships, and attempting to 
                    prove their own worth to themselves through 
                    these type of terrorist attacks.

                    Never succeeding in that task (or in any 
                    other), since they have no worth, they will one 
                    day take a look at themselves and what they've 
                    done in their past, and kill themselves in 
                    disgust.  This is a Good Thing, since it saves 
                    the taxpayers' money which normally would be 
                    wasted on therapy and treatment of this 
                    miscreant.

                    If they *really* want a challenge, they'll try 
                    to destroy *my* hard disk on my BBS, instead of 
                    the disk of some innocent person.  I challenge 
                    them to upload a virus or other Trojan horse to 
                    my BBS that I can't disarm.  It is doubtful the 
                    challenge will be taken: the profile of such a 
                    person prohibits them from attacking those who 
                    can fight back.  Alas, having a go with this  
                    lowlife would be amusing for the five minutes 
                    it takes to disarm whatever they invent.

                    Go ahead, you good-for-nothing little 
                    slimebucket:  make *my* day!

     Funny isen't it?  Well Mr. Dickburg, I am not an adolesent, nor am
     I impotent.  I lead quite a healty social life, and have no sucidal
     urges.  What I am is a person who (mabey because of some deep down
     psycological disorder) finds joy in seeing some geeked out,
     computer nerds system go down the drain in a flash.

     Oh yes there are others like me out there, many others.  It (virus
     writing) is a joke.  It is done for a good laugh, to see dickheads
     like you lose time and money.  So my friend, at this time I start
     an active campain after you ass.

     Anyone out there who wants to make some dicks day, call this
     assholes cheap BBS and lets take him down.   The number is
     (212)-889-6438.   Trojans, Ansi-Bombs, and all Viruses are acepted.
     Go to it!
