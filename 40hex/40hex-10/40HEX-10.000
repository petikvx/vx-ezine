40Hex Issue 10 Volume 3 Number 1                                      File 000

    Welcome back to yet another issue of 40Hex, Phalcon/Skism's magazine chock
    full of virus writing techniques, news, source code, and related info.

    First off, Phalcon/Skism welcomes its newest member, FirstStrike.  We have
    watched him grow from humble beginnings and are confident that he will
    continue to produce quality viruses in the future.

    We will, beginning with this issue, be phasing out the debug scripts in
    40Hex.  Although many people find them useful, we feel that source code is
    more interesting and worthwhile.  The disassemblies are almost always done
    by Dark Angel, who advises those with difficulty understanding some parts
    of the disassemblies to first skim the entire disassembly to learn how the
    virus works.  Some portions, he continues, are not commented because their
    functions are self-evident and the label names reflect their respective
    purposes.

    In the spirit of friendly competition, we have, in this issue, the Ontario
    3 virus written by Death Angel of YAM.  While on the topic of YAM, we find
    it immensely amusing that they continue to adamantly state on FidoNet and
    elsewhere that the IVP was not a mere hack of PS-MPC.  Ok, it was a rewrite
    in Pascal, but the only significant changes were in the labels; even the
    comments were remarkably familiar. Please cease this farce; you are fooling
    nobody.
