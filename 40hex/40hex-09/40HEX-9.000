40Hex Number 9 Volume 2 Issue 5                                       File 000

     Welcome to the ninth issue of 40 Hex!  This month brings lots of exciting
and neat-o stuff.  The feature article this month is Dark Angel's tutorial on
SYS infections.  As always, we have more virii news and more disassemblies and
yes, even more debug scripts.  A few quick notes:

     - Join PS/Net!  Contact your friendly neighborhood Phalcon/Skism sysop
       for details.

     - We have been copied extensively by virtually every virus group in
       existence and, with few exceptions, have not been given credit for
       our work.  It is getting tedious, to say the least, to reread what
       we have already written.  In the future, please don't be quite so
       lame.

     - Landfill is down again, but a new board, Liquid Euphoria, run by
       our newest member, Hawkmoon, has taken its place.  The board is
       stable and will not go down without warning, we promise!  Call it,
       love it, hold it as your own.  Special thanks to Hawkmoon for
       editing portions of 40Hex.

     - All are invited to contribute to 40Hex, be it in the form of an
       article, original virus, or whatever.  Contact a Phalcon/Skism
       board for details.

     - Finally, happy new year to all virus and anti-virus people everywhere!
       The new year promises to bring more nify innovations in both virii and
       viral toolkits from Phalcon/Skism.  Stay tuned.
