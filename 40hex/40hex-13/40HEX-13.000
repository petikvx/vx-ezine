40Hex Number 13 Volume 4 Issue 1                                      File 000

     No, we are not dead.  We are however insanely busy.  This upcoming 
year will be a legendary year for P/S with regards to various programming
projects.  Can I tell you about them?  Yes, but I won't.  I will say that 
we will be contributing immensely to the virus community.  Notice, I did
not say Vx.  Whenever I refer to the virus community, I am not refering
specifically to virus writers, virus collectors or Vx BBS sysops.  I am 
refering to everyone who has an interest in viruses.  Whether its stopping
them or making them.  It may be a split community, but I still percieve it 
as ONE community.  
     I am not going to ramble, I am not going to ramble...  Anyway, enjoy
the issue.  If you like this magazine, please let us know.
