     Well that will do it for this issue.  Sorry it took so damn long,
     but screw it.

     Next issue we will have more articals, more viruses, and all that.

     We were supposed to have an interview with an Amiga virus writer
     this issue but we just couldn't get it in time.  Also we were
     planning an interview with John Mcafee, but the same story there.

     Also next issue, I hope to have the Bob Ross virus, from the
     twisted mind of Dark Angel.  And If I can find it, the DIR-2 virus
     and The Teqeulla Virus, so I can't spell.

     See you then.
