  Well the virus world is going as good as ever, dispite the over 20
  virus scanners/removers out there.

  The October 28th issue of PC-Magazine did a huge artical on the newest
  virus scanner/defense systems.  Mentioned in the artical were SKISM-1
  and Captian Trips.

  There is a new catagory of viruses out there, DIR-2 viruses.  Havent
  located one as of yet, but hope to in the near future.

  Bogus SCANS continue to surface in the public domain.  As if SCAN 82
  was not played with enough, there have been many reports of bogus
  versions SCAN 84.  Most of which contian trojan bombs and will distroy
  the FAT table or boot sector of you hard disk upon execution.

  I have the unreleased phone numbers of John Mcafee. Including his
  private office, home, and fax numbers.  Get a hold of me somehow and I
  will get them to you.

  Theres a bogus version of the Red Cross virus going around on h/p
  boards.  The first command is to terminate the program.  Things people
  do for credit these days.

  In case you haven't yet heard Patti Hoffmans VSUM, virus information
  summary is now a giant hyper-text database.  It's really a good
  program, check it out.  Can't wait to see a bogus version of that
  going around.

  That's it for no - till later.
