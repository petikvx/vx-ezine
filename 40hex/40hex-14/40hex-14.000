40Hex Number 14 Volume 5 Issue 1                                      File 000

   Wow, another release of 40hex.  Bet you thought we were dead.  Wrong. 
Lots of stuff has happened since the last issue of 40hex.  The most
important thing to note is that my apartment burned down back in November. 
I lost pretty much everything, but miraculously, my 386/33 and the 8 megs of
ram inside it survived a BIG fire, the water hose, then being thrown out of
a 3 story window.  All of the information I had was destroyed however.  
   The next thing I would like to mention is the Wired Article that appeared
about PHALCON/SKISM.  It sucked.  Besides the fact that I was called the
"Official Archivist", it was filled with standard virus hype.  But hey, at
least we get to see a picture of Hellraiser and Mark Ludwig.
