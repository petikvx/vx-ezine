                         Instigator --- Busted!

At 2:40 pm EST, Jan 20, '92 a local cop pulled Instigator (me) out of my very
entertaining Social Studies class and informed me he, 1 other local cop and
2 MCI phone fraud investigators were gonna serve a warrant on my house and
confiscate my computer shit.  So the cop takes me to my house and they start
disassembling all of my computer stuff, and take all of my notes and shit.
They filmed all this.  They informed me I would be charged with theft of
services, credit card fraud and a bunch of other shit, like 3 felonys and
5 misdimeanors till they were done.  Anyways its about a week and a half 
after the incident now and they only formally charged me with theft of 
services.  So the worst that is gonna happen is I will get 1 year of 
probation.  The best thing is they are thinking of only giving me a citation
or totally dropping the charges.  I am suppose to get my system back after
the DA comes to my house so I can show him how I did it.  As for Digital
Warfare I wanna give to someone to set up.  Anyway I made it to the front
page of 3 local newspapers so here is one of the articles:

               (Shit inside the ***( )*** are my comments)

                       From the front page of the     
                         Intelligencer Journal            

               2 "Hackers" caught stealing phone service
  
  Using sophisticated computers and telephones, two Lancaster County
computer hackers touched MCI, a Washington-based telephone communications
network, for approximately $4,700 last year. ***( Sophisticated phones? )***

  Their activities represent "only the tip of the iceberg" of 
telecommunications fraud, which carries an annual $1 billion to $1.5 billion
price tag, according to John Houser, a MCI spokesman. ***( Dick )***

  The two are accused of accessing MCI's computer and obtaining "25 card 
numbers, thet we know about," Houser said.  "We know they made calls all over
the United Sates, to Canada, Great Britain, and West Germany"

  "None of the card numbers have been issued to Lancaster subscribers," 
Houser said. 

  Columbia police are charging an 18 year old borough resident with credit 
card fraud, unlawful use of a computer, theft of services, and criminal 
conspiracy according to Sgt. C. Joseph Smith. Police are withholding his 
identity until he is formally charged, Smith said.

  West Donegal Township chief Charles R. Bronte said a fifteen year old 
suspect ***( that's me! )*** living in his jurisdiction was being refered to
juvenile authorities by the department investigator, Cpl. Kenton Whitebread.

  Officers with both departments said this was an entirely new kind of 
criminal case for them.

  "I'm still going over our suspectes statement," said Smith, "and even when
I'm done, I don't think I'm going to understand (all the technical jargon). 
We're getting a lot of help from MCI."

  "If our juvenile hadn't cooperated, it's possible we'd still be looking at
his equipment", Bronte said.  "He went into the computer, using his access
codes," ***( He means I logged on my board )*** " to retrieve the information
necessary to continue the investigation".

  Police confiscated computer telephone equipment, whose value is estimated
***( Estimated - Gimme a break!)***  in the thousands of dollars, when they
executed search warrants at the residences of both suspects, Jan. 20.

  "It was a real United Nations collection," said Bronte, "There were a 
number of different manufacturers" of the equipment taken in West Donegal.
***( United Nations collection? )***

  Most of the equipment taken in Columbia was made by Tandy, Smith said. 

  Both posessed programs and equipment which allowed their computers to 
generate thousands of random numbers. 

  Houser said that once an individual had knowledge of MCI's calling card
format "they could access our computer switching equipment, and begin 
generating random numbers. ***( they make it sound so technical )*** They
could allow their equipment to run 24 hours a day."

  Houser declined discussing the company security, but acknowledged "We
became aware of an unusual number of calls coming into our computer line. We
eventually were able to trace those calls back to the originating telephone 
equipment." ***( ANI )***

   Bronte said MCI investigators arrived at his department early Monday
afternoon.  The warrant was executed at 2 pm, Bronte said.  "We took
investigators to the suspects home, while Cpl. Whitebread picked up the
boy at his school. 
	
	Smith said the Columbia warrant was served at 5:18pm on Monday.
The suspect and another individual were working on his computer at the time.
"They weren't doing anything illegal," he said.

	Smith said MCI first became aware of the two local hackers "about
Dec. 14".  They were monitoring them since."

	The officers said they did not believe either of the two profited
from their activities. ***( Free Phone calls! )***

	"I think it was just a case of him getting involved in someting that
was entirely over his head, Bronte said.  ***( Yeah, right )***

	Houser said MCI's investigation was continuing.

	"We have reason to believe they shared some of their information with
others," he said. "At this time I can tell you we have no other suspects in
Pennsylvania, but that could change tomorrow."

	He said investigators were unsure at present if any of the computer
data had been transmitted to other hackers. ***( They said one paragraph up
that they thought we shared some of the information.. Duh )***
