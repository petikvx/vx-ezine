       We, the members of PHALCON/SKISM, in order to form a more perfect
  environment worldwide for the virus community, establish justice, ensure
  intracommunity tranquility, provide for the common defense and offense,
  promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to
  ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of
  Worldwide Virus Writers.
  
       ARTICLE I - REGARDING ORIGINAL VIRII
            Section A - DEFINITION
                 The term "original virus" herein indicates programming done
                 exclusively by either one individual or group, with no code
                 taken from any other source, be it a book or another virus.
            Section B - CODE REQUIREMENTS
                 For an original virus to conform to the standards set by
                 this document, it must include the following:
                   1) The title of the virus in square brackets followed by a
                      zero byte should be in the code, in a form suitable for
                      inclusion into SCAN(1).  This is to ensure that the
                      name of the virus is known to those examining it.
                   2) The name of the author and his/her group affilition/s
                      should be included in the code, followed by a zero
                      byte.  At the present, this is an optional requirement.
                   3) Some form of encryption or other form of stealth
                      techniques must be used.  Even a simple XOR routine
                      will suffice.
                   4) If the virus infects files, the code should be able to
                      handle infection of read only files.
                   5) It must have some feature to distinguish it from other
                      virii.  Creativity is encouraged above all else.
                   6) The virus must not be detectable by SCAN.
            Section C - IMPLEMENTATION
                 This section, and all sections hereafter bearing the heading
                 "IMPLEMENTATION" refer to the recommended method of
                 implementation of the suggestions/requirements listed in the
                 current article.
                   1) Virus_Name db '[Avocado]',0
                   2) Author     db 'Dark Angel, PHALCON/SKISM',0
  
       ARTICLE II - REGARDING "HACKED" VIRII
            Section A - DEFINITION
                 The term "hacked virus" herein refers to any virus written
                 by either one individual or a group which includes code
                 taken from any other source, be it a book, a code fragment,
                 or the entire source code from another virus.
                 The term "source virus" herein refers to the virus which
                 spawned the "hacked virus."
            Section B - CODE REQUIREMENTS
                 For a "hacked" virus to conform to the standards set forth
                 by this document, it must include the following, in addition
                 to all the requirements set down in Article I of this
                 document:
                   1) The title, author (if available), and affiliation of
                      the author (if available) of the original virus.
                   2) The author of the hacked virus must give the source
                      code of said virus to the author of the source virus
                      upon demand.
                   3) No more Jerusalem, Burger, Vienna, Stoned, and Dark
                      Avenger hacks are to be written.
                   4) The source virus must be improved in some manner
                      (generally in efficiency of speed or size).
                   5) The hacked virus must significantly differ from the
                      source virus, i.e. it cannot be simply a text change.
            Section C - IMPLEMENTATION
                   1) Credit db 'Source stolen from Avocado by Dark Angel of
                      PHALCON/SKISM',0
  
       ARTICLE III - REGARDING VIRAL STRAINS
            Section A - DEFINITION
                 The term "viral strain" herein refers to any virus written
                 by the original author which does not significantly differ
                 from the original.  It generally implies a shrinking in code
                 size, although this is not required.
            Section B - CODE REQUIREMENTS
                 For a "viral strain" to conform to the standards set by this
                 document, it must include the following, in addition to all
                 the requirements set down in Article I of this document:
                   1) The name of the virus shall be denoted by the name of
                      the original virus followed by a dash and the version
                      letter.
                   2) The name of the virus must not change from that of the
                      original strain.
                   3) A maximum of two strains of the virus can be written.
            Section C - IMPLEMENTATION
                   1) Virus_Name db '[Avocado-B]',0
  
       ARTICLE IV - DISTRIBUTION
            Section A - DEFINITION
                 The term "distribution" herein refers to the transport of
                 the virus through an infected file to the medium of storage
                 of a third (unwitting) party.
            Section B - INFECTION MEDIUM
                 The distributor shall infect a file with the virus before
                 uploading.  Suggested files include:
                   1) Newly released utility programs.
                   2) "Hacked" versions of popular anti-viral software, i.e.
                      the version number should be changed, but little else.
                   3) Beta versions of any program.
                 The infected file, which must actually do something useful,
                 will then be uploaded to a board.  The following boards are
                 fair game:
                   1) PD Boards
                   2) Lamer boards
                   3) Boards where the sysop is a dick
                 No virus shall ever be uploaded, especially by the author,
                 directly to an antivirus board, such as HomeBase or
                 Excalibur.
            Section C - BINARY AND SOURCE CODE AVAILABILITY
                 The binary of the virus shall not be made available until at
                 least two weeks after the initial (illicit) distribution of
                 the virus.  Further, the source code, which need not be made
                 available, cannot be released until the latest version of
                 SCAN detects the virus.  The source code, should it be made
                 available, should be written in English.
            Section D - DOCUMENTATION
                 Documentation can be included with the archive containing
                 the binary of the virus, although this is optional.  The
                 author should include information about the virus suitable
                 for inclusion in the header of VSUM(2).  A simple
                 description will follow, though the author need not reveal
                 any "hidden features" of the virus.  Note this serves two
                 purposes:
                   1) Enable others to effectively spread the virus without
                      fear of self-infection.
                   2) Ensure that your virus gets a proper listing in VSUM.
  
       ARTICLE V - AMENDMENTS
            Section A - PROCEDURE
                 To propose an amendment, you must first contact a
                 PHALCON/SKISM member through one of our member boards.
                 Leave a message to one of us explaining the proposed change.
                 It will then be considered for inclusion.  A new copy of the
                 Constitution will then be drafted and placed on member
                 boards under the filename "PS-CONST.TXT" available for free
                 download by all virus writers.  Additionally, an updated
                 version of the constitution will be published periodically
                 in 40HEX.
            Section B - AMENDMENTS
                 None as of this writing.
  
       ARTICLE VI - MISCELLANEOUS
            Section A - WHO YOU CAN MAKE FUN OF
                 This is a list of people who, over the past few years, have
                 proved themselves to be inept and open to ridicule.
                   1) Ross M. Greenberg, author of FluShot+
                   2) Patricia (What's VSUM?) Hoffman.
                   2) People who post "I am infected by Jerusalem, what do I
                      do?" or "I have 20 virii, let's trade!"
                   3) People who don't know the difference between a virus
                      and a trojan.
                   4) Lamers and "microwares puppies"
            Section B - WHO YOU SHOULDN'T DIS TOO BADLY
                 This is a list of people who, over the past few years, have
                 proved themselves to be somewhat less inept and open to
                 ridicule than most.
                   1) John McAfee, nonauthor of SCAN
                   2) Dennis, true author of SCAN
            Section C - MOTIVATION
                 In most cases, the motivation for writing a virus should not
                 be the pleasure of seeing someone else's system trashed, but
                 to test one's programming abilities.
