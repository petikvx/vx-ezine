40Hex Number 5 Volume 2 Issue 1                                      File 000

        Welcome to Issue 5 of 40Hex, the monthy semi-annual magazine 
published for all those interested in learning more about computer viruses.
        Lots of new news:

  1) Well, Hellraiser has lost computer and housing temporarily, so DecimatoR
     had taken over the magazine.  There has been so much new stuff, a lot got
     changed since the time I received this issue.  Special BIG ASS greets to
     him for all of his work on this issue.
  2) Digital Warfare is down, as Instigator got busted for phreaking.  We will
     let you know more when we know more.  Before its demise, its virus
     collection had grown incredibly, thus stocking 40Hex for life.
  3) LandFill BBS went back up. I am back in the scene again.  Give it a ring.
  4) As of the release of this file, I have heard of more busts, specifically,
     Gengis Kahn and Rain Man.... could be rumor.

     BTW, for those of you who have the "Anti-FiRe" virus, SCAN 86 catches
     it as "Infinity"... probably due to the text it contains.  Course, it was
     distributed on a VGA loader for the InFiniTy boards... heh heh heh...
