                            Is This The End?
                            ----------------

   Well, to be honest.  I'm kind of tired writing this magazine.  It's
   not like I hate it or anything, it's just too much pressure for one
   person to handle.  Decimator helped me out a bit with a few articals
   and such.  But still every time I do an issue it's me who does the
   marjority of the work.  It seems the magazine is bigger than I
   thought.  It seems to be on everybodys BBS from NY to California,
   from Canada to Europe.  The thing is I can't write this thing by
   myself anymore.  I work everyday from 2pm - 10pm and I will be going
   back to school next semester.  So I don't have time to handle all the
   things I do.  So in the long run the magazine suffers.  Anyway,
   unless people want to help out (mabey the reason is that I haven't
   really asked before) lemme know.  Contact me on Digital Warefare.
   The numbers in an artical in this issue somewhere I'm sure.  Anyway,
   fuck it, If people don't contribute soon this may well be the last
   issue of this rag ever.  So whatever happens in 1992, we shall see.
   So if this is it, later people.  My viruses will still be coming on
   strong as always...
