Subj: IS THIS A VIRUS?
Hi.  Is there a known virus which displays a screen which reads "INC, for
quality cracks?"  I have recently inherited a computer at the company I work at
and there was apparently some tetris and blockout games on the disk which are
the source of this message.  I found a file called "runme.bat" with the text in
it, but even after I deleted it, it still pops up the aforementioned message.
Also, the message gives me a choice of EGA CGA or monochrome and in general,
the message makes life difficult for me.
        any help with this would be vastly appreciated.

If you can upload a copy of an infected file, we can see if it contains viral
code.

It's not a virus.  INC is the International Network of Crackers.  What they do
is unprotect games and distribute them.  What you do have is most likely
illegally obtained software.

 Haha! Funny guy. I believe you are referring to the Roland D-10 and S-10
series of keyboards... R-10 being a keyboard... bah!
