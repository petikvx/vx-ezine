40Hex Issue 4                                            December 1991

                               Whats New
                               ---------

     Well a lot of things been going on this month.  Well I've been
     really lazy lately and haven't gotten around to writing this issue
     for over two months I guess.  Well let me tell you whats been going
     on.

     Let me take the time now to address these lame fucking people who,
     if they had 9600+ modems, would be wares puppies, but being they
     have a 2400 they decide to practice there leeching habits on
     viruses.  They are the virus collectors, they ones who never run
     the damn things, just add them to there collection and upload them
     here and there to be really, as they say, "K-K00\_."  Please
     mother fuckers, stop.  I mean look at the Red Cross virus, does
     anyone have the real copy of it?  Some lame ass collector found
     something that scanned as Red-X and was "/> a |)" enough to upload
     it everywhere.  Please, give it up.  Virus BBS's are a great thing,
     and without them we would be lost, but by the same tolken these
     collectors, or as someone once said, "Micro-Wares Puppies," must
     get with the program or die.

     Well second of all, I've been calling The Homebase quite a bit
     lately and came to one conclusion, people are dumb.  Look in this
     issue for some scroll backs of stupid things people have posted on
     that BBS this month or so.

     The Bob Ross virus has been released in the mist, so watch what you
     D/L.  Hmmmm, I think SCAN 85 caught it, but that will change soon,
     right DA?

     Funny story.  I infected my schools computer with several viruses
     before I transferred out.  Well what I heard happened from that is
     this.  They somehow could not get the viruses to dissapper no
     matter what they did.  Incedently it was Whale and some other
     viruses. Anyway, out of the fustration of the viruses reappering
     all the time, they decided to out and get rid of all the hard
     drives.  So they removed all the hard drives from all the systems
     and put them in storage.  Anyway, they finally got a virus expert
     to come it, he said that they didn't have to get rid of the hard
     drives he can rid the viruses.  Well to late.  The art department
     had got a hold of them and wealded them together into one big
     statue!  Thousands of dollars worth of hardware down they drain.
     The school was so embarressed at the whole thing they shipped the
     statue way out of state where so everybody would soon forget this
     screwup.  Thanks to Shade of Sorrow for finding that one out for
     me.

     SCAN 85 _is_ out, 'nuff said.

     Bet you all heard the story about Novell and Stoned III?  If not
     this is the run down.  Novell got infected by Stoned III.  Novell
     distributed infected copies of the December update to everyone.
     That's the story.
