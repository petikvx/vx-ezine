                 The Ultimate Virus Programmers Toolkit
                 --------------------------------------

    Just thought it would be funny to list what I think is the ulitmate
    virus programmers toolkit.  Theroys may vary.

    - Turbo Assembler (MASM sucks, and it is slow)
    - Turbo Debugger (It rules, what else can I say?)
    - Quick Edit (Small, Fast and Turbo-like keys)
    - Sourcer 486 (The ONLY real dissembler out)
    - Virus Scan by McAffe Asst. (It really is a great tool)
    - VSUM (Patti Hoffman is a stupid bitch, but I must admit, this
            program is the virus underground bible)
    - VSAFE from Central Point Anti-Virus (Not as annoying as Flu-Shot)
    - Pklite Proffesional (If you don't have it - get it)
    - Norton 6.0 (Diskedit alone is worth the d/l time)
    - Pc-Backup by Central Point (we all fuck up sooner or later)
    - MEMWALK.EXE (great shareware program, like diskedit for memory)
    - Teledisk (for boot block virus saves)
    - Trunc - by Skism Programming (Electronic file shredder)
    - Microsoft Press Quick Reference Series
               - DOS Functions  (INT 20 - 26)
               - ROM and BIOS functions (INT 10, 15 - 16)
               - MS DOS extentions (Expaned, extended memory interupts)
    - _Undocumented DOS_ or any current text file on the subject-
    - 40HEX magazine (Well I do have good stuff here, sometimes)
    - Dark Angel's Phunky Virus writing guide (pretty hard to come by.
                                               He expalins stuff well)
    - The following source code
               - Leprosy-B (beginers only on this one, none-the-less)
               - Cancer (well documented, intermediate)
               - Tiny-F (not bad intro to .COM infections)
               - Dark Avenger (well availible and excellent tips on .EXE
                               infection)
               - Stoned II (boot block intro)
               - Secure 2.0 (I got the source to this.  It is a virus
                             detection system from the guy who wrote
                             1260, Mark Washburn.  The source has some
                             great examples on debug trapping, TSR
                             skills, and encryption)
               - IBM Scan source (I have this too, it's funny... Kinda
                                  like McAfee's SCAN but lamer.  By
                                  David Chess)
    - An account on the Bulgerian Virus Exchange +359-220-4198
    - An account on a BBS with Fido-Nets' virus echo (keep track of your
                                                     latest score)
    - Many accounts on the Homebase BBS (408) 988-4004 2400 bps
                                        (408) 988-5138 HST 9600
                                        (408) 988-5190 v32 9600
      (Tell Areyh I sent ya')
    - Scientific Calculator (Hex aint easy)
    - Vivaren (Helps you break night, or any other controlled substance)
    - Food, smokes, or whatever your vice is...


    That'll do it...
