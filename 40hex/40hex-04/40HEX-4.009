                      Hacked Pklite File Scanning
                      ---------------------------

   In issue two, i belive it was.  I release a method of making Pklite
   files un-uncompressable and un-detectable.  Well seems a few people
   used the trick for wrong doing.  What do I mean by wrong doing you
   ask?  Well lets just say lame trojans and such.

   Anyway, I had a few sysops on my ass about the trick and so, so now I
   am must release.... The hacked Pklite scanning strings.   Well I
   could really give a fuck if someones BBS gets crashed, but then again
   I am freinds with a lot of sysops.  And besides I have a new trick
   anyway :)

   Well there are two strings.  One for .EXE files and one for .COM
   files.  And here they are.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

   "01 F0 FF 50 00 00 00 03 01" Pklite EXE
   "53 33 DB 53 CB 03 01"       Pklite COM

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's my new trick???  Well I won't reveal it at this point... But here
is a another compression trick.  It lets you compress a file with Pklite
then again with LZExe.

First
-----

Compress the file with Pklite

Next
----

Compress the file with LZExe

It wont let you cause the file becomes bigger...

But
---

Use the DOS Undelete function to undelete the file ?zexe.tmp.  Thats the
twice compressed file.  Rename it to what you want.  Destroy the LZ
header... And there you have it...
