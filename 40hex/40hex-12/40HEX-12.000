40Hex Number 12 Volume 3 Issue 3                                      File 000

    Welcome to 40Hex issue 12.  This issue confirms that we are no
longer in our hibernation period (i.e. laziness).  We have been out of
the virus scene for quite some time, due to physical circumstances
beyond our control.  We have done a lot of reorganization, and trimmed
our fat a little bit.  You can expect a lot from us in the upcoming
year, and I can assure you, you won't be dissappointed.  Due to the
large gap of time between issue 11 and issue 12, some of the information
in here may be a little outdated.

    We are going to get a little bit more political then we used to be,
but we will still keep cranking out the high quality technical
information that you all enjoy. I would strongly recommend that you
don't skip over the political parts of the magazine, because there are
people who want to make laws that will affect every reader of this
magazine.

    On a completely seperate note, we can now be reached via Internet.
If you have any comments about the magazine, news articles, editorials,
etc. we'd like to know, and we'll probably put all of the interesting
letters into the magazine.  Email us at:
