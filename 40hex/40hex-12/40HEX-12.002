     40Hex, the world's most popular underground virus magazine is now
available in two versions -- the familiar online magazine and a new
printed magazine.
     In the past two and a half years, 40Hex has become the most popular
virus magazine in the underground.  The new printed magazine (dubbed
40Hex Hardcopy) is intended for anyone who wishes to learn as much as
they can about computer viruses -- from the source, the virus writers.
     Each issue will contain --

     o A complete virus disassembly, fully commented in the 40Hex
       tradition,

     o Detailed programming articles, intended for those fluent in
       assembly,

     o Introductory articles intended to help those on all levels of
       ability, and

     o Interviews with virus writers and virus researchers.

     Also included is an editorial column, which will provide a forum
for discussions about any virus related issue.  Submissions from both
sides of the argument are welcome, and will be given an equal voice.


     Subscriptions --

     The price for 40Hex Hardcopy is $35 per year for individuals, $50
per year for corporations.  The magazine is bimonthly (six issues per
year).

     The online magazine is available free of charge from many privately
operated BBSs.  You may receive a disk with the latest issue from us for
$5.  Please send a note specifying whether you would like a 5 1/4 or a 3
1/2 inch disk.
