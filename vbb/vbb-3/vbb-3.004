I have included the Win.Tentacle virus in the file Tentacle.exv.  Rename it
to tentacle.exe to use it!  Here's the description!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 NAME: Tentacle
 ALIAS:Win.Tentacle
 TYPE: Non-resident EXE -files
 SIZE: 1958
This Windows-based virus was found in the wild from France and UK in March
1996. The virus was distributed in a file called dogzcode.zip via the
alt.cracks usenet newsgroup. Tentacle infects Windows 3.1x EXE files.

Tentacle infects files in the current and Windows directories. It does not
stay memory resident.

Occasionally, Tentacle will replace the icon in the infected EXE file with
it's own copy. This new icon has a picture of a tentacle and the text
'Tentacle'.

                      Win.Tentacle.1958

          -------------------------------------------------------

          It is not a dangerous nonmemory resident parasitic
          virus. It searches for NewEXE-files in current and
          C:\WINDOWS directories, then writes itself to the end
          of the file. While infecting the virus creates
          temporary C:\TENTACLE.$$$ file, then modifies and
          copies blocks of original file to temporary one, then
          copies temporary file to original one, and then deletes
          temporary file.

          From 0:0am till 0:15am the virus checks the just
          infected file for the Resources, and searches for Icon
          resource. If such Resource is there, the virus
          overwrites it with another icon which is contained in
          the virus body.

          The virus contains the internal text string:

           C:\TENTACLE.$$$ C:\WINDOWS\*.EXE
