There's been a lot of stuff happening at VBB since the last issue.  7 people
have joined the team:

        Bishop
        Phadera
        MugWomp
        KColt45
	Arsenik
	God@rky
	RickDogg

Also we now have 2 official distribution sites.  The first one is being 
set-up at ILF and KColt45 has his own server which he will kindly provide us
with our own directory to store our data.  KColt45 will also be programming
a visual interface for our mag.  So expect to see some changes here. :)

                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's almost been 2 month since the last issue of the VBB mag.  It got delayed so
many times because people were on vacation, or the didn't hand in their articles
on time.  And now, we just got RickDoggs new virus which we wanted to evaluate
before we give it to you.  Well, we didn't quite reach all out goals, but I still
hope that you'll enjoy this issue of the VBB mag.


                                 THANKS!!
                                 ~~~~~~~~
First of all thanks to all VBB members who have helped me so much in creating
this mag and programming virii.  This is the first issue in which you'll find
homemade VBB virii.  Also I would like to say thanks to all you readers who
have given me feedback on how you liked the mag and what you wanted to see
more/less of.  Please keep it up. 


Ok people, that's it for now.  Peace! :)
