                       NOT AGAIN!  CAUGHT BY F-PROT
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of you prbably know the feeling when you just have this brand-new,
homemade virus which you spent weeks on creating, and here it is finished
and perfectly new.  Well, you put it through one last test.  You compile the
virus and scan it with F-Prot(or any other scanner).  And there is the 
horror message:  

Possibly a new variant of (whatever)

All your hard work for nothing.  But, there is something you can do against that.
Remember how I showed you a method on how to find scan strings in a virus?
Well, you use that method to find what F-Prot is looking for.  Then you split
the stuff up using jumps and calls.  Example:

Recently I have been working on a tutorial for Overwriting Virii for 
beginners.  I used simple code to find a file to infect, and when I compiled
the virus, F-Prot told me that the virus could be a possible variant of 
Trivial.  As a definition it told me that Trivial is a tightly programmed
virus made to only reproduce.  So my code that I used was close
to the code if the Trivial virus.  So to solve my problem I moved the 
beginning of the virus. to the middle and I issued a call and I put a jump 
in front of the old part which I moved so that I wouldn't be executed again.
Problem solved!  F-Prot didn't think my virus was a variant of Trivial.  So
even though this method isn't small, it still works.
