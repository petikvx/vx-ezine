ALIAS: HDEuthanasia
TYPE:  Stealth OS Boot MBR Boot Resident COM/EXE -files
ORIGIN:Slovenia
This is a resident stealth multipartite virus with antiheuristics and
antiemulation tricks, encrypted with a slow polymorphic encryption layer.

Krsna infects COM and EXE files, MBRs of hard drives and floppy boot
sectors. Infected files and boot sectors are encrypted with a slowly
changing polymorphic encryption layer. Infected files are marked by 
setting the seconds field of the time stamp to 34. Krnsa will not infect files
starting with 'TB' or 'F-'.

When an infected file is run, the virus first infects the MBR of the hard
drive. When the machine is rebooted, the virus will install itself to
memory from the MBR and it starts to infect also floppy boot sectors 
during floppy access as well as COM and EXE files.

When resident, the virus occupies over 9kB of memory. Infected files will
grow around 7-8kB in size, depending on the polymorphic decryptor. The
polymorphic decryptor contains several conditional and unconditional 
jumps and several calls to do-nothing interrupts to confuse heuristics and
emulation. Polymorphic encryption changes slowly, trying to make it
difficult to create a large sample set with variable decryptors.

Krsna will attempt to hide itself in files, but it will sometimes report
the infected files to be little bigger or smaller than they originally
were.

Krsna is Windows 95 -aware: it will delete the floppy disk driver file to
make make itself capable of spreading to floppy disks used from Win95.

Krsna activates on the 22nd of August. At this time it displays this 
text:

	"HDEuthanasia" by Demon Emperor: Hare Krsna, hare, hare...

After this the virus attempts to overwrite the hard drive and A: and B: 
drives. This produces a 'Non-system disk' error, but the virus stays 
resident after the destruction is done - so it can still replicate if a 
boot floppy is inserted to start up the machine. 

Krsna was found in the wild in USA in May 1996 and it was apparently 
distributed over the internet, as infections were soon found from 
Canada, UK, Switzerland, Russia and The Netherlands. 
----------
Hare.7750

This is a newer variant which has some bugs corrected. The text message 
in the virus has been changed to: 
 
     "HDEuthanasia-v2" by Demon Emperor: Hare, Krsna, hare, hare... 
 
Otherwise the virus is like the original variant. 
------- 
 Hare.7786

The text message in this variant has been changed to: 
 
	"HDEuthanasia-v3" by Demon Emperor: Hare, Krsna, hare, hare...

	  Krsna.7610

	  -------------------------------------------------------
	  Krsna.7610 is a very dangerous memory resident
	  multipartite stealth and polymorphic virus. It infects
	  COM, EXE files as well as the MBR of the hard drive and
	  boot sectors of the floppy disks. In files, the virus
	  is encrypted three times. In infected sectors the virus
	  is polymorphic as well as in the infected files.

	  Installing and Infecting

	  When an infected file is executed the virus decrypts
	  itself, infects MBR of the hard drive, traces and hooks
	  INT 21h, and returns to the host program. Then the
	  virus writes itself to the end of COM and EXE files
	  that are executed, closed or on DOS calls Terminate
	  (AH=0,31h,4Ch). Under Win95 the virus also hooks INT
	  13h.

	  While opening an infected EXE file the virus disinfects
	  it. When the virus infects a file, it checks the file
	  name and does not infect the files:

	   TB*.*
	   F-*.*
	   IV*.*
	   CH*.*
	   COMMAND*.*

	  The virus also does not infect the file if there is
	  letter 'V' in its name.

	  While loading from infected boot sector of the floppy
	  disk the virus just infects the MBR, returns the
	  control to the host sector, and does not stay memory
	  resident.

	  While infecting the hard drive the virus traces INT 13h
	  or uses direct calls to the HD ports, then it writes
	  itself to the MBR sector, and the rest of code writes
	  to the last available track in the hard drive (the
	  track that is out of declared tracks - LandZone?).

	  When the virus stores and overwrites the original Disk
	  Partition Table, as a result the FDISK/MBR command may
	  crash the hard drive. While loading from infected MBR
	  the virus restores Disk Partition Table to let DOS load
	  the active boot sector and calculate the disk
	  information (at this moment the virus' INT 13h stealth
	  routine is not active), then it decreases the size of
	  the system memory for its TSR copy (the word at the
	  address 0000:0413), hooks INT 1Ch and returns the
	  control to original MBR.

	  By hooking INT 1Ch the virus waits for the DOS loading
	  procedure, then restores the size of the system memory,
	  hooks INT 13h, 21h, 28h. On first INT 28h call the
	  virus again corrupts the Disk Partition Table. I see no
	  reason for such complex procedure of installation into
	  the system, but only to fool the anti-virus hardware
	  and software, if it is installed.

	  By hooking INT 13h the virus intercepts access to
	  floppy disks, and infects them. While infecting the
	  virus formats extra track on the disk, and writes its
	  code to there. It also calls a stealth routine while
	  accessing to infected disks.

	  Features

	  While executing a infected files the virus also
	  searches for "WIN=" string in environment area, and
	  deletes the \SYSTEM\IOSUBSYS\HSFLOP.PDR file in the
	  Windows directory.

	  While installing memory resident the virus checks the
	  system date and on the 22nd of August and September it
	  erases the hard drive sectors and displays the message:

	   "HDEuthanasia" by Demon Emperor: Hare Krsna, hare, hare...

	  While infecting the MBR the virus performs some strange
	  manipulation with keyboard: it hooks INT 16h, checks
	  the keys that are entered, and sometimes substitutes
	  them with 'Y" or 'N' keys. It looks as the virus tries
	  to fool BIOS anti-virus features, and answer "Yes,
	  Infect it!" on the standard request while writing to
	  the MBR of the hard drive.

	  The virus uses quite a strange way to run its
	  polymorphic routines. While infecting a computer the
	  virus generates a block of random data and saves it to
	  the last sectors of the hard drive. Then the virus does
	  not correct these random data in any way. It restores
	  that data (reads from the sector) while loading from
	  infected MBR or while executing a infected file. While
	  re-infecting the disk (if it has been disinfected) the
	  virus detects these data in the last sector and does
	  not renew them.

	  While infecting a file or a sector, the virus uses that
	  data as a random generator to select the opcodes and
	  keys for its polymorphic routines - in all cases the
	  polymorphic routine gets the same data, and produces
	  the same code when the virus infects any object.

	  As a result all polymorphic decryption loops contain
	  the same code in all infected files that were infected
	  on the same computer. All such files are encrypted by
	  the same code and with the same keys. The length of the
	  files grows on random value while infecting
	  (VirusLength plus the length of polymorphic decryption
	  loop), but that value is constant for all files on the
	  same computer. And the same for infected floppy disks -
	  all they contain the same polymorphic code in their
	  boot sectors.

	  As a result all files and sectors that were infected on
	  the computer have the constant mask to detect them with
	  anti-virus utilities. Is it directed against anti-virus
	  researchers, or just to fool users and hide the
	  infected file/floppy-guest that caused infection?

I have put the virus into the file Hdeuthan.exv.   As usual rename it to
Hdeuthan.exv to use it!!
