  This is a little lamer, but I have seen this just 3 or 4 times on virus, I
 am talking about find directories to fuck... instead of look for files, the
 virus will look for other directories... Well, I invented a little big func-
 tion to do that that took me 2 weeks of research and tests... take a look, I
 think that is possible to decrese the size of the function, but it's up to 
 you... fill free to change everything yo want on this peace of code:

 Start:
      call GET_DTA         ; Get proper DTA address in DX.
      push dx              ; Save it.
      mov ah,1AH           ; Set DTA.
      int 21H
        
      mov ah, 04eh                       ; Search for first subdirectory
      mov cx, 00010001b                  ; Dir mask                        
      lea dx, maske_dir                  ; 
      int 21h                            ;
      jc Erro                            ;

      pop  bx                            ; Get pointer to search table (DTA)
      test BYTE PTR [bx+15H], 00010001b  ; Is this a directory?
      jz Find_next                       ; No, find next
      cmp BYTE PTR [bx+1EH],'.'          ; Is it a subdirectory header?
      jne Real                           ; No, it's a real directory!!

 GET_DTA:                                 ;
        mov     dx,OFFSET DTA2           ;
        mov     al,2BH                   ;
        add     dx,ax                    ; Return with dx= proper dta offset
        ret                              ;

DTA2      db 56H dup (?)                 ;dta for directory finds (2 deep)
maske_dir db "*",00                      ; search dir's

  It's very simple... know you can right real cool virus!! He he, if you find
 a best way of do this kind of search.. please, tell me ok?!? See ya..
