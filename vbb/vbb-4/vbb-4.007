                         The Coconut Virus Resurected

                    By God@rky & Virus Bits & Bytes Magazine

        A few months ago, The Coconut Virus debuted on God@rky's Virus Heaven.
Since then, apparently the virus has made it's way around, as F-Protect now
detects it as "coconut.1323".

        Hence, it was time for a new version. Enter COCO-AP! (coconut.1870).
Available with this issue is the new version.  You will find with the archive
of this Issue (#4) the file "COCO-AP!.ZIP" in it, is the file "COCO-AP!.COM".
What follows is the low-down on this new virus.  It is not detectable as a
strain, but will probably be considered as a member of the newly found
Coconut virus family.

        The New Coconut Virus, Coconut.1870 (refered to as COCO-AP!
throughout the rest of this article) is explained as being appending this
time as opposed to its overwriting ancestor (coconut.1323), but it still
remains as undetectable as the 1323 virus.  COCO-AP! is a .COM infector which
*DOES NOT* infect COMMAND.COM or files lesser than 128 bytes or larger than
60,000 bytes (60k). Infected Files will show an increase in size of
1,870 bytes.

        COCO-AP! is non-resident using encrypting and anti-tracer
technologies.  It infects 2 files each time it or an infected file is
executed, using the dot-dot infection method.

        The Payload is non-destructive.  On December 25th (Christmas) and
December 31st (New Years Eve) the virus will not infect, but it will
change 40x25 displays to 40x50 and prompts the coconut wishing it's victems
A Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year.

        Currently this virus is confirmed as being Undetectable by the
following AntiVirus Software Packages (But it is probably safe to say nothing
will currently detect this virus on a system):

(FPROT) F-Protect v2.25
(TBAV)  Thunderbyte AntiVirus v7.06
(AVP)   AVP v2.2
(SCAN)  McAfee Scan (Whatever the current Version is)
(NAV)   Norton Antivirus v3.0

        It is quite possible that in the future we will see the Coconut virus
mutate again and see it become Resident, or possibly Multipartite or even
become a boot sector infector.  Stay Tuned!
