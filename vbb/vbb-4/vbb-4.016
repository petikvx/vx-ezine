Intro:
	Sup. I am Liquid Cool. I am new to VBB for about a week or so.
Dark Knight made me president of the hacking/phreaking division. Each issue I
will be writting about hacking and/or phreaking. So if you have any questions
or you want to joining my division just mail me at "LCooL@juno.com" All of
you probably know about how my group got busted up. What you may not know is
that Dark Fierce is still around. He doesn't hack at all but still phreaks and
has been programming in VB 4.0 and 3.0 for a while. I just wanna say wus up
to: Dark Fierce, Coals of Fire, Acid Fallout, and DJ Shine.

Bud Box:

	I'll just explain how to build some easy phreaking tools. My
favorite way to tap a fone is the Bud Box by Dr. D-Code & The Pimp. This is a very
simple box to build and very simple to install. Here's how you do it.
First get a piece of fone cord, cut the end off, then, strip the most outer
wire off so that you have the red, green, black, and yellow wires sticking
out.  You won't need the black or yellow wires so you can cut them off or you
can use them to build a busy box. Now that you have done that you should have
a red and green wire sticking out. Strip the outer wire off those, now
connect them to alligator clips and walla! You have a Bud Box!

Installation:
	Go out two someone's house and look for a medium sized grey
colored box. All you need is a screwdriver ( any kind of screwdriver will do
fine) to open it up and get full access to their fones from the outside. For the
bigger boxes any screwdriver will do as well. I have heard much about
needing a tool called a 40 hex for this. That is not true, but to use most boxes
you won't need it. Okay, open up their fone box and inside you should see a
fone cord leading into a jack, if you unplug it they can't use their fones,
but don't do that. Close to it you should see screws with the following
colors on them: red, green, yellow, and black. Concentrate on the red and green
screws.  Usually you can find a little bit of exposed wire leading in or out of
one of the screws. If you can find it on both you've got it made. If you can't
skip down to the next section. If you can just clip the red alligator clip on
the red screw and the green alligator clip on the green screw. Now plug the
other end of your cord into a working fone and listen for a dial tone or some
people talking. BE QUIT! They can hear you. My favorite place to go
boxing is apartments. Another kewl thing to do is switch their fone lines around!
Everything will be normal but their fone number. I also like hooking that
up to my modem or fone and making long distance calls to bbs and shit like
that.
	
	This section is for if you don't have the exposed wire. Unscrew
the screw just enough so that you can clip the alligator clip on. Then when
you have enough space clip it on. Then you should hear an dial tone or people
talking. By the way... opening anyone's but your own fone box is illegal.
He he.

Legend:
| or - = Fone Wire
: = Green Wire
* = Red Wire
(+) = Alligator Clip

I appologize for the crudity of these schematics but it isn't an easy
thinng
to do.

Bud Box Tips:
1. Do it at night.
2. Wear black.
3. Bring a SMALL flashlight so you can see what the hell you are doing,
but make sure that the flashlight is not so bright that it will wake the
people up.
4. Wear gloves so you don't get your fingerprints on the fone box.
5. Bring a long extension fone cord so that you are not close to the
house when you are talking... you might wake the people up.
6. Make sure you have running shoes on in case you get caught. If you get
caught you better run like hell. A couple of my friends have been grabbed
and taken into the house.
7. Don't take any ID with you like a driver's license in case you get
caught.
You don't want people to know your real name and address.
8.(Optional) I would recommend wiping the box clean if you don't wear
gloves.
Again so you don't leave finger prints.
9. And most important of all... be QUIET! At night it is very quiet and
people can easily hear you, especially if your standing right next to
their house.
	Instead of unhooking their fone cord to disconnect their fone...
you can just take a piece or the black or yellow wire out of a fone cord and
connect one end to the red screw and one end to the green screw. That
will also disconnect their fone and won't look as obvious when/if they look in
their fone box to find out why they can't use their fones.
	And in case any of you are wondering what the hell I was talking
when I said you can switch around their fone numbers... it only works
when they have more than one line. For every line they have there will be
another plug for that line. Each normal sized fone box has a capacity of 6 lines.
Just unplug the lines and switch them around. They probably won't notice
until they start getting strange calls from people they don't know.

Rainbow Box:

"Rainbow Box: SUPPOSEDLY non-existant. Kills trace by putting 
120v into the phone lines, SUPPOSEDLY!"
(Exerpt from a phile found on BBS, author unknown)
   The above sums up what a Rainbow box does, but it is VERY
understated. It is a VERY powerful box capable of doing a great amount of
damage to both the fone lines, your fone and the person at the other end
of the line's fone and/or modem. Right now you have everything you need to
build one, so let's see how.
You'll need:
1 Fone (Rotery with access to the mouth part)
1 Extention Cord (120v or 220v, your choice)
1 Wall outlet
1 Wire splicer

Okay... now unscrew the mouth part of the phone and take the speaker off.
You'll see two wires, a red wire and a black wire. Now splice the
extention cord, you'll see a red wire and a black wire. Splice the black wire in
the cord to the black wire in the phone, do the same with the red. There you
have it. You just made a non-existant Rainbow Box! Don't you feel special?
	
	How to use: Plug the fone in and then plug the extension cord in.
BE CAREFUL! 120v isn't enough to kill you but it just might make you piss
your pants.
	
	How it works: The phone lines can resist a charge of 6v and a
little more, when you plug in that cord, you're sending 120v or 220v through the
lines. It blows out everything, but it is non-selective. Odds are you
will take out every phone in the neighborhood and get caught. It will melt the
phone if you let it go long enough. WARNING: THIS DEVICE CAN VERY EASILY
START A FIRE, BE CAREFUL WHEN PLAYING AROUND WITH THIS!
	
	Well I'll probably be writing about hacking in the next VBB issue.

Until then peace out.
