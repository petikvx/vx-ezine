	Yes, it has been a very long time since the last issue of our E'Zine, 
but I guess everybody (especially me) was really busy with other things in 
life such as work.  Because of this huge "hole", there were even some rumors 
of VBB having stopped.  As you can see this is not true.
	
	While I was absent from all the virus discussions you were well 
entertained though by God@rky, who started to publish his excellent God@rky's
Virus Heaven Newsletter.  Keep up the good work!

	The only sad thing that occurred to me recently was the fact the VLAD 
issue #7 was supposed to be the last of those excellent VLAD E'Zines.  Well,
I guess there will be others to replace it.

	For the rest I care about, everything is going fine, except that
Rickdoggs page was discovered on Pipeline USA, and he was kicked off the 
service(Yes, you understood it right!).  He is now back on ILF with all of 
us at http://www.ilf.net/rickdogg/.
