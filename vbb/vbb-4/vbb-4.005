				The Destruction Kit
				~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I have just recently recieved the new macro virus creation kit from the SLAM virus team.  I
personally think it is pretty neat, and it gives you good control over your virii's abillities.
Below I pasted the description the author sent to me....  There's only one problem I have found,
which is the fact that all code generated is in German, which makes it hard to use

Hi....

I've created a new macro virus creation kit. 

THE DEMOLITION KIT

Normally every generated virus must work with every word version!!!

(Normally, because I couldn't test it) ;-))

It creates:

* AutoMacro Virii's
* Non-AutoMacro Virii's
* Polymorphic Macro Virii's (with a AT THE MOMENT new polymorphic routine)
* Trojan Horses

Some Options:

* 11 different Payloads
* 10 different Trojan Horses
* 11 different Dos Virii's (to insert in a macro virus)
* 8 different keyboard keys (for polymorphic and non-automacro viruses)
* Timer to activate Payload


If you think that could be a good progi then use one of the following
