                Computers, Viruses & The Long Arm Of The Law

        Over the history of the Computer Underground, I think it's biggest
enemy has always been the mainstream press.  National or International media
attention has always brought in opinions from those whom are not framilliar
with the terrotory they are covering.  The Computer Underground houses
many of the hazy areas to which the general population of media employees
know little about.

        Last Summer, the LordNatas v666 Bug written by Rickdogg of Virus Bits
and Bytes magazine was unleashed on Rickdogg's school's computer network.
Most of the Hub-bub however didn't come from the virus itself, but from the
editorials Rickdogg wrote on his webpage (Pipeline USA), aiming insults and
personal opinions at authority figures in his school.  None of which were
slanderous (to my memory) or defematious.  He also however threatened his
classmates.

        Shortly after being expelled from this school, or maybe during this
process (The details are a bit fuzzy), this whole topic became subject of the
local newspaper's editorial section, in which people blamed his upbringing,
and various other little quips about someone they knew nothing about.
Rickdogg endured all this ridicule, with no means of rebuttal as he lost his
Pipeline USA account in the process of this.  While he now has the means to
voice his opinion and tell a partal side to his story at his new site located
at the Information Liberation Front, he has decided to have it published in
Virus Bits & Bytes Magazine.  So here are the words straight from Rickdogg's
fingers to your screen:

Dear VBB Magazine,

        This is the infamous RickDogg replying finally to all the bold and
rude statements made in the editorial section about my fight against the
Kanawha County school board. To be frank, some of these editorials were
ridiculous and showed just how ignorant people are of computers and law.

        I have a right to Freedom Of Speech. Period. If you do not agree to
this, then go live in another country. I can call anybody what i want to
call them, and they can do nothing about it. If i want to stand up and call
E.J Smith a fool or a moron or a dumb bitch, then I can do it. It is also
ridiculous to call me stupid for saying how i feel about certain people. I
find that honest, even if the thoughts were not that comforting towards the
individuals. I am not, I repeat not sorry for what I called my teachers or
staff personnel. I am not going to back down from them any longer. I merely
voiced my opinion and if they don't like it, then they can go to hell for
all i care. It was also uncalled for by blaming my parents on raising a bad
child. I am an excellent child that just so happens likes to voice my
opinion. I am not ashamed or bashful by what I think and society cannot
accept true honesty from a person. People were appalled that an honors
student thought 'bad things' about teachers. Do you people even know what is
going on? Teachers are called a lot worse than what I called them, but I
just choose to put my topics on my web page and not say it to their face.
How is that different? 

        The one thing I am truly sorry for was threatening my classmates.
That was completely uncalled for and unjust. I should have used better
judgement when I wrote my homepage material. If i had, then I would probably
be at Capital High School right now.

        The issue of the actual virii incident itself took a back seat with
all the talk about my homepage and my comments. The virii did no harm, and
posed no threat to the computer network at Capital High. There was also no
lost time on the network for any students due to the system being shut down
to 'clean' the virii. Mr. Hart even testified that the virii only took 30
seconds to remove. The virii were just there for a joke, to show off if you
will, my hacking skills. That was the entire purpose of the incident. Not to
gain attention, not to get back at a friend or destroy the entire computer
network. I am not ashamed nor shy to the fact that I specialize in computer
virii and hacking. I enjoy this 'hobby' very much and I spend a great deal
of time learning and practicing this past-time. As of this date, I have over
11,000 virii in my collection along with numerous documents from my hacking
exploits. I just wish that people would use this case to learn what is to
come in the future as society moves closer and closer to a computer
dominated world. What I did would be considered amateur by my standards, as
I could have done far worse damage without even leaving a trace. I write my
own virii that are undetected my Anti-virus software, so do not EVER think
you are safe with one of those. This is only the beginning of what is to
come. Remember, you have been warned.

        As far as School life now goes, I love East Bank. It has provided me
an opportunity to relax and enjoy my senior year of high school. The
administration, the faculty and the students have treated me one hundred
times better than I was treated at Capital. This whole incident has thus
turned into a blessing in disguise. I am truly happy and not ashamed to
attent this fine school. I have been accepted with open arms by everyone and
I am finally looking forward to getting up and attending school every morning.

        As far as future plans, it looks like I will attend West Virginia
Institute of Technology at Montgomery and double major in Electrical
engineering and Computer Science. I also will be bringing my home page up
again with new and exciting material dealing with this whole incident as well
as all my virii in my collection. It seemed that my previous site was shut
down due to the content of the page. This time, homever, this will not be a
problem. Please feel free to email me with any questions you have about my
situation or computers in general.

Regards,

RickDogg

        We at Virus Bits & Bytes Magazine are happy to have the chance to
print Rickdogg's response, in continueing with the tradition of America  and
the values it was founded upon and allowing people to speak freely.  Funny
how the ACLU didn't seem to have interest enough to stick thier head into
this one.  Go Figure.
