        Just about anyone who has been in either the Vx or AV worlds for any
period of time, has run across the UseNet newsgroups pertaining to the
subject of viruses.  Here is a brief rundown of what you would have found 2
months ago:

comp.virus    - This is a heavily moderated newsgroup who's primary existance
                regardless of what you are told by the moderator or it's
                inhabbitants, is to serve the AV community, and postings of
                source code or Vx ideas is not welcomed in any fashion. If
                you fancy a world where everything you read has been pre-
                selected for content and opinion to be mentally palletable,
                then this is the place for you.

alt.comp.virus- This newsgroup is alot like comp.virus, except for that it is
                unmoderated.  Your posts will always appear on this newsgroup
                unless for some reason someone at your ISP is filtering your
                posts, at which point you will probably want to consider
                switching ISP's.  Posting source code or dropper files is
                not recommended here.  They will appear, but the infamous
                George Wenzel as well as a possible host of other people will
                probably send in letters of request for the termination of
                your account with your ISP.  So it is best to be aware of the
                TOS (Terms Of Service) agreement which your ISP has with it's
                subscribers. The primary arguement here is that you are
                posting binaries to a discussion group.
               
alt.comp.virus.source.code - This newsgroup is more or less a FREE-FOR-ALL.
                             Just about anything goes here, because for the
                most part, the AV community has stayed away from the News-
                group, as the title of the newsgroup cannot really be
                twisted as being an anti-virus forum.  On the average, you
                will see 5-10 viruses posted a week, 10% of which will be
                new ones.

        So this dosn't leave the Vx community much of a forum to speak
freely.  Sure there is always the IRC, but many of us have better things to
do with our time than hang out on the IRC.  A good example of the Vx
community on the IRC was at #virus on Effnet.  Yeah, usually around 10 people
logged into the channel, and maybe 1 or 2 lines of dialog every 5 to 10
minutes having nothing to do with viruses.  I would be willing to bet that
most serious virus authors would rather be coding, than waiting for some
newbie who has just discovered scripts to come in and make an attempt at a
channel takeover.  Up until now, E-mail has been on our side.

        Months ago, many will recall that I wrote an effort to get people to
come to alt.comp.virus and post and post and post, to even things out a bit.
It was sucessful in some ways and a failure in others.  PhreeX who was
helping tremendously with this effort, came up with an ultimately better
solution to this problem, and now that it has arrived, I will tell you all
about it.

        New, to the alt. hierchy of newsgroups; PhreeX, God@rky, VBB and
those who feel Freedom of Speech is important welcome in the new newsgroup
alt.binaries.com.pro-virus...

        At last, a newsgroup that yu can subscribe to.  A newsgroup that is
definately there to allow the transmittal of binary virus posting. A
newsgroup that not everyone's ISP may necessarily carry, but I think most
will.

        Currently I am the only person who has posted to it. Possibly the 
only person who has subscribed to it at this point. I would like to
see others join in as well.  This is an unrestricted medium, one which AVer's
are in denial of it's prosperity to us.  They are banking that your ISP will
not carry it, in thier interests. So I ask all of you who would like a second
medium in which to discuss and spread your work, send your postmaster a
letter today.  A nice one, an undemanding one, merely stating that you would
like to subscribe to alt.binaries.com.pro-virus, you don't need to explain
why usually.  And you don't need to explain what would appear in it.  Just
give it a try.  I look forward to seeing more people in there.
