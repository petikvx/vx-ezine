					VBB IS EXPANDING!
					~~~ ~~ ~~~~~~~~~~

In the future, VBB will not only serve virus writers, but hackers and phreakers, too!  We will
add a hacking division under Liquid Cools(lcool@juno.com) leadership!  Liquid Cool will be
responsible for recruiting new people and managing the division.  In case you don't know him yet,
here's a small rundown on him written by himself:

About a year or two ago my partner ( Dark Fierce )
and I decided to start a group. We really hate America Online. So that
was our prime target. We started getting talented members in our group.
It was I, Dark Fierce, Acid Fallout, Coals of Fire, and Darth Vader. A
week or two later we started to notice that Darth Vader wasn't doing shit
so we kicked him out. He didn't know shit about hacking or phreaking. He
started his own group called Laser Tag. It was nothin but people who
didn't know shit. There was a kid from my school in the group and I knew
his e-mail address. So I sent him a simple batch file that deleted
everything on his hd. I wanted to see if he was smart enough to look at
it through EDIT... he wasn't. I told him the program would hack him into
any computer. He ran the program and got fuct. Eventually they found out
it was me.  We also got busted a little while later.
Dark Fierce and I started a new group. KnightZ oF HeLL. I wrote a
magazine for the group. I put my e-mail address in the mag for questions
that people had. Some kid that lives by me got a copy and showed it to
everyone, including his mom, he knew and told them I wrote it. Now it was
only the first issue so it didn't have anything too bad in it. That was
the second time. Just recently I got busted because I was on Telnet
scanning NUA's ( Network User Address ) when I mistyped an NUA. What I
typed in was a code for NASA'S PACKET SWITCHING SYSTEM. I was fooling
around with it for a few weeks, until I got busted. The code that I typed
in is still working today. That was the third reason. Dark Fierce stopped
hacking and went to programming in Visual Basic. I still do everything
that I used to do.
