			Why Am I Doing This?


	Hi!  Have you ever wondered why the hell somebody would sit down
	just to make a mag for other people to read and to enjoy 
	(maybe learn :-))  Well, I'm not profitting of of this work, but 
	at least I'm helping the world of virii programming different and 
	more interesting!  The goal of this mag is to supply you with source,
	played out virus code and hints on how to program (modify, etc) 
	virii.  That's why I'm doing this.  TO bring life into the virus 
	community, to see some action.

			Help Wanted!!!!

	Ok, I'll admit it right now.  This mag isn't going to survive long
	if I don't get anybody to help me and to collect some news.  I don't
	have the time nor do I feel like writing this mag on my own.  So if 
	you want to help send some mail to 101546.2222@compuserve.com.

			Greets!

	Hi to all you virus programmers out there!  Also greets to Godarky
	who owns a nice little page of virus source code on the Web.  Also 
	special greets to VLAD whoose Win95 virus "Bizatch" I feature in this
	mag.
