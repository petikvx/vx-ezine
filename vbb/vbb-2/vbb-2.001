				What's Up?
				----------

It hasn't been very long since the last issue of this mag and there really 
hasn't been a lot of things to write about.  But let me list what little has 
happened.

We have a new member!!!		---->Aurodreph

He knows a lot about macro virii which caused me to give him the job of writing 
the macro virus articles.  Also he will distribute this mag on various BBS's
in France.  Welcome aboard Aurodreph!!


				Mag Stuff
				---------

As usual at this point I will ask you to please contribute to this mag.  You
don't have to be a member to contribute articles or virii.  I would really 
like to get some people involved in this mag.  So please submit your 
articles to me at 101546.2222@compuserve.com!

Hi,

Yes, I write some articles for the mag... about macro virus... Because I 
study this type of virus, and I write some "interesting" macros.
I want to update the underground FAQ with the new virus macro..

For the next issue, U heard about new macro virus like DIVINA, ANTI-DMV 
and NOP.  So if you have more informations, please help me... :-)
