            Virii and Safety
            ----------------


I'm one of the people who really enjoy downloading and playing with virii.  
SInce I have no idea of what some virii do, I don't want them to infect my 
Hard drive.  So to prevent them from doing so I always issue the following 
commands:

subst D: A:\
subst C: A:\

These commands redirect all accesses to my D and C drive(My 2 HD's) to the A
drive.  I have found this method 100% safe.  But recently I have gotten 
complaints by people who tested the infections and then took off the subst 
commands to avoid restarting the computer.

Subst commands can be removed by using the following command line:

subst D: /d
subst C: /d

Before they did this they didn't think that the virus may be resident which
will consequently result in HD or MBR/BR infections.  So please when you
use these commands when playing with your computer it is always wise to use
a COLD boot to remove the virus from memory.

If you are more paranoid, you can use a little soft like WPHD that prevents
 any access to your hard-drive for writing or formatting. Interesting :-))).
 Be careful not to use it with Windows...because it makes lot of accesses to
 your HD and will present millions of errors...
