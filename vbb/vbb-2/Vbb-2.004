			The 2nd Annual Virus Challenge
			------------------------------


Well, it's time again for a new Virus challenge.  As you have probably seen
I included the Monkey Virus source in this issue.  In the description after 
the source there was mention of the virus not being polymorphic.  So
after seeing that I got the idea for this virus challenge.  With this
mag you recived the Polymorphic Mutation Engine for the virus challenge.  So
as you can guess your challenge is to make the monkey virus polymorphic with
or without the help of of the MTE.
