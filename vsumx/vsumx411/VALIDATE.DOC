                             VALIDATE Version 0.3
                            From McAfee Associates
                                (408) 988-3832


     VALIDATE is a file-authentication program that may be used to 
check other programs for signs of tampering.  VALIDATE uses two 
discrete methods to generate Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC's),
which are then displayed for the user to compare against the known
value for the program(s) validated.  The known validation data can
be published by the author of the program or be obtained from a
trusted information database.  The dual CRC checking provides a
high degree of security.

     The Computer Virus Industry Association (CVIA) provides an
online database of validation values for shareware authors at no
cost.  You are encouraged to call the CVIA's BBS at (408) 988-4004
to access current validation data for McAfee Associates' VIRUSCAN,
California Software Concepts' SHEZ, Vern Berg's LIST, and other
shareware programs.

     To confirm that a program is in its original, untampered
state, run the VALIDATE program on it, record the validation data
produced, and compare it against the record in the online database. 
If they match, than it is highly improbable (less than one in
sixty-four quadrilion) that the program has been modified.

To run VALIDATE, type:

     VALIDATE d:\path\filename.ext

The VALIDATE program will then display the following information:

                   Size:  (#/bytes)
                   Date:  (file creation date)
    File Authentication
         Check Method 1:  (a four digit CRC)
         Check Method 2:  (a four digit CRC)


The VALIDATE program may be copied and distributed at no charge as
long as it is distributed whole and intact and unmodified in any
way, along with this file.  Please report virus infections and
reports of program tampering to:

The validation data for VALIDATE.COM is:

                   WITH CRC            WITHOUT
                   CHECKING            CHECKING
                   Size:  6495         6485
                   Date:  10-31-1989   10-31-1989
    File Authentication
         Check Method 1:  4637         CB21
         Check Method 2:  1214         13B7

     If you have an older version of VALIDATE, it may be ten (10)
bytes shorter.  This is because it was not processed by VIRUSCAN's
CRC-checking feature, added in Version 66 of VIRUSCAN.  The
validation code can be removed from VALIDATE.COM by running
VIRUSCAN against it with the /RV Remove Validation option. 
However, this is not recommended.
