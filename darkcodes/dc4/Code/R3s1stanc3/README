I was bored and I wanted to play a bit with ASM. This is the result:
A little shitty loader, which loads a file and executes it.
It simply drops a shell script, which actually loads the file and executes it.
It deletes itself after the execution and just like the shellscript.
There is a version for 32 and 64 bit linux plattforms.
