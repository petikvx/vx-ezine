After Perforin told me about his idea of using the printer for a payload, I tried to write such a payload in Java, but it only works for Windows.
I didn't find any way, to write a printer payload for linux, but I wrote a virus in Java.
This is my first whole virus, I release and I think I will write some more in Java because it runs on every plattform and there aren't many viruses written in Java.
