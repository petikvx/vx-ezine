 :Editorial: "The morality of it all..."

  Welcome back Ladies, Gentlemen and Others to the famed and feared pages
of the Discordant Opposition Journal. Right, that's the pleasantries over
with... This release of the DoJ is by far an exception. Digital and Kleptic
went out into the rough world and kicked ass. They gathered huge amounts
of articles and submissions. Thanks Guys for the hard work. But although
I am grateful for our readers who submitted, just remember that we always
need more. This level of interest shouldn't just die off. Send all those 
articles that you want published to discordia@Rue-the-Day.net and we will
be eternally grateful.

  But back to my editorial. Its been awhile coming, but I got control of
the Editors chair once again... [Cue Evil Genius Laugh] Muahahahaha !!!
I just want to put across some ideas on general mentality and morality.
Anyone who dabbles or is interested in the Underground needs to have
some sense of morality. Some guiding beliefs. But I'm not going to rant
on about Ethics and the difference between hackers and crackers, so you
can keep reading...
  Intellectual copyright is the copyright that is placed on something that
is created through the use of the mind and not the hands. A piece of music
that is composed, a book that is written or a painting that is painted
are all protected by intellectual copyright. It is more of a concept then
an actual law just that most courts will recognise it and award in the 
favour of the creator. 
  I've always had very strong believes on the areas of our lives that we
should keep above board. Drinking underage is a little bit of a no-no, a 
very little one. Sex before marriage is only a sin if you bother to believe
some balding fat priest who tells you it is. And punching some guy cause
he slept with your girlfriend is only bad if you slept around behind her
back [If anyone has had such a situation - mail discordia@rue-the-day.net
cause we're bored]. But I'd never condone using forged tickets to get 
into concerts or buying bootleg videos. And recently I was 'given' a CD 
copy of the latest Placebo album from a friend and thought nothing of it. 
But another good friend brought me around and made me wake up to the 
reality of bootleg music. So I binned the CD and have only looked back 
when my other music becomes boring.
  Now I'm not telling you all to throw away all those bootleg tapes you 
have of Metallica concerts where the mike was taped to some fat guys hairy
chest, just that you should think about it first. Unlike a wide selection 
of my friends I am still a capitalist. And to that extent it might seem
that I could accept buying the same thing just cheaper cause its stolen
but instead I feel strongly that what someone creates they own. Never
underestimate the value of something that someone else made simply because
you didn't put in the work.
  That goes for music CDs as well as servers...
  Ah, bollocks. On with the zine.
