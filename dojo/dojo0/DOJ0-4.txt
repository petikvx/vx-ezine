 Nick: Rue-the-Day
 E-mail: root@Rue-the-Day.net
 Reason behind nick: Most people who know me would probably
agree that an old, archaic English phrase that's fallen into
disuse is suitable for me. Actually I do see 'rue' used a
fair amount, always brings a smile to my face. Usually in
fantasy or sci-fi books, but that's okay. Incidentally 'rue the
day' means to regret a past misdeed or action, glad we've
got the cleared up.
 I guess that I have to ask myself two questions; 'What do I
want to tell people about me?' and 'What do people want me
tell about myself?'. I think the answer to both is 'as little
as possible'.
 Brief physical description (for those that care). I'm tall 
(6'3"), thin and pale. I wear a lot of black, I'm generally
the kind of guy that people refuse to sit next to on public
transport. It has something to do with my self-perfected 
aura of menace, I think...
 I'm involved in the Kevin Mitnick campaign, I'll be talking 
more about that in future issues, I feel that is very impor-
tant. At this point I'm primarily interested in hacking 
although I do still phreak (when I need to). I'm quite fond
of Unix, definitely as an alternative to Windows.

 Nick: Cronus
 Reason for nick: Cronus was a Greek mythological God. He 
was God of the skies and also ruler of the Titans. The nick
is my celestial ego trip...
 Background: I got involved with computers at an extremely
young age and taught myself to program. This progressed to 
going on-line for the first time as a teenager. I have been
learning and understanding ever since I first sat in front 
of a computer and the net was simply on outlet for that. I
quickly got interested in hacking and my knowledge grew and
still is growing. 
 Ethos: I live by firm ethics of never damaging and never 
taking money. Victims are not just there, they are man-made.
 Areas of interest: Computer security, both Unix and NT. 
Also programming and freelance web design (something has to 
pay the bills).
 Description: Hmm... tall, big and scary or so I'm told. My
eccentric personality is to my credit and my heavy sense of
morals to my advantage. 
 Current projects: This Zine namely, but also my site is 
getting a major over-haul; http://homepages.iol.ie/~cronus
and I am actively securing a few servers (from the outside).
