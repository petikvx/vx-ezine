:A Look At The Melissa Word Macro Virus:
 By RELM

[The Virus]
Im sure you have heard about the Melissa Virus, Most people have. The Microsoft Word virus known as Melissa started spreading Friday, March26, 1999, This virus spread fast threw the internet. In just a couple of days this virus spread Worldwide and infected Thousands If not Millions of computers around the world faster then any virus to date. This virus spreads when you execute an infected document, If you use Outlook shipped with Internet Explorer 4.+ as your mail client then the Melissa virus would send itself to the first fifty people on your address book. Now the fifty people on your address book would send the virus to another fifty people so on and so on.

[The Job]
The Melissa virus infects MS Word 97 and MS Word 2000 documents and goes about by adding a new VBA5 module named Melissa. Now before the virus attempts to do a mass mailing it looks for the following registry key in the registry: "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\" as "Melissa?" value.
If the virus finds this value in the key "Melissa?" set to the value "... by Kwyjibo" it will not attempt another mass mailing because a mass mailing has allready been done on the current machine. If the virus does not find this value in the key then it will attempt a mass mailing, First the virus would open Outlook then useing MAPI calls it would use the user profile set in Outlook, The virus would then create a new E-mail message with the following subject "Important Message From Joe" (Joe being the user profile), Then the body of the e-mail would say "Here is that document you asked for ...don't show anyone else ;-)", Next the virus would create an attachment to the e-mail and the attachment would be the infected Word document, After this is done the sequence is complete and the messages are mailed to the fifty people on the users address book.

[The Virus Creates Security For Itself]
To create more security the virus deactivates the Tool-Macro Menu is MS Word 97 and in MS Word 2000 it deactivates the Macro-Security Menu. Now to hide its infection activities the virus disables the Save Normal Template Option, The Confirm conversion at Open option and the Macro virus protection option. Doing this would make the user to not be able to know that there is a macro virus in the document.

[Just For Fun]
Once every hour the virus triggers an action, At a certain min (A Minute that is specified) past the hour corresponding to the date, If you open a infected document at the appropriate minute the virus will insert the following text "Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here." into the infected document.

[Conclusion]
The base of the melissa virus is not unusual, The thing that is unusual about the virus is the way it spreads threw e-mail and how it travels threw the internet in such little time. Now you should by now have a clear understanding of the Melissa Virus and the way it works, I have tried to outline some inportant facts about the virus and hopefully give you a better understanding of it. Everything that I have explained in this document can be clearly seen in the source code at the bottom of this text.


[The Code]
This is the Melissa Word Macro Virus code, I trust that you will use this for nothing more then learning.
