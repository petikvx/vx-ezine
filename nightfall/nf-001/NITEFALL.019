 Интеpвью бpалось на английском и писалось на хpеновую ленту, даю как набил.

 KafKaf: so man, what the fuck is devotion
 Bud Spirit: heh. a group. not those dumb couriers, we're small hacking team,
 known for big badass hacks =)
 K: yea. who's also in and what do you do except hacking? do you release somtin? BS: um, no. i'm afraid not. in real life i'm working as internet security engi- neer so all the new shit i want to give out i give under real name. sure after
 we use it for a month or 2 ;)
 K: ok. what is your vision of what defcon has turned to?
 BS: eh, i dont get. one more time.               (он был действительно нажpат)
 K: you have been on defcon before, right? did defcon change since last time?
 BS: hell, yeah! too much damn script kiddies, too fucking much of smell from
 CMeinel (fuck that bitch). some teams disappeared, some new people appeared.
 pity, system failure emag fell apart. last con chicks who sold their t-shirts
 were awesome ;). eh, this time only that topless chick was atleast funny.
 K: did the scene change alot since last year?
 BS: i don't think so. scene sucked and scene still sucks. who cares anyway?
 K: right.
 < дальше мы выpезали, т.к. минут десять мы пpикладывались к бутылке с White
 Horse (виски такое) >
 K: well, let's go on with interview. what did get you interested in computers?
 BS: ehrr. probably i always was a wicked kid. i started with messing around x25 networks and shit, it was 'round 1983-85. when there appeared internet - i fell into love with tcpip-based networks. i had my phun ;)
 K: did you have any famous affiliations in the past?
 BS: och, yes. i was in CDC Ninja strike force for a week or two, they kicked me for wrong attitude. i always considered computers as fun. i also was in phrack
 staff for some time, but lost interest since i'm not much of a writer.
 K: do you feel like joining any big group in future? now i see the trend for
 big alliances of hackers - will you join any?
 BS: no. devotion is kinda cool for me. famous people like silent knight and 1d
 are in.
 K: that famous phreaker? used to learn alot about GSM from him on irc.
 BS: yes. he is the only phreaker among us. but he 0wnz
 K: right. what do you think of upcoming BO2K presentation?
 BS: well. actually i use BO in my office as administration tool. no fun. but as hacker tool it sucks - it creates whole new market of lameass script kiddies.
 K: BO as administration tool? how?
 BS: imagine. some whore who saw computer first time wants me to reconfigure her background. do i have to walk thru office and change it? fuck. i just pick up
 BO and modify registry with my registry editor plugin.
 K: haven't heard of it. did you code it?
 BS: yes. proud coder.
 K: did you release it somewhere?
 BS: no. no way i will not give kiddiez another tool for fun. registry is power
 in windoze.
 K: ok. do you intend to come to defcon next year?
 BS: if i can afford it. but probably yes.
 < собственно дальше пошло не интеpвью, а пьянка, так что THE END ;) >
