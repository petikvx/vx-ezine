				 Introduction
				 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well after a bunch of delays, it's finally here... just in time for christmas.

Merry Christmas everyone..

Welcome  to  Freedom  Issue 1. First  let me  begin by explaining  what 
Freedom is. Freedom is an electronic newsletter devoted to the freedom of 
information, we, like many other electronic newsletters, believe that the 
people have the right to know everything, and mostly things that they 
shouldn't (all legal of course). Since we are just starting out, this issue 
will be fairly small but hopefully in the future as our reader population 
grows so will our issues. Freedom is basically a reader supported newsletter.
I will be writing articles as often as I can, whenever I find something 
interesting, but I also ask that if you have an article or an idea which 
would suit the magazine to please contact us. Anything of interest relating 
to the computer underground, hacking, phreaking, anarchy, and other issues 
would be welcomed. Material may be taken from this magazine as long as the 
source, and author are mentioned, and the article remains unchanged.

				 Reaching Us
				 ~~~~~~~~~~~

If you would like to submit an article, or just drop us a note, you can either
call up our support board (204.669.7983). There is a new user password, to get
on the system, login to the public USENet system first (waffle), and leave me
mail asking for it. I'm in the process of hooking up UUCP feeds to the system, 
so in the next issue i'll include the address.

Thanks to ElZorro for proof reading and editing this entire issue.

				 till next time....

			 How to lock up TAG 2.6 boards
			      by Thunder/ICEMAN


	This was discovered by a friend of mine (Thunder) so I don't take
credit for finding this but since he didn't want to write up the article I
decided to since it was an interesting bug.

	This is extremely simple so if you don't understand this you will need
help. Basically, what you have to do is write a message containing the 
required character sequence and then quote it. Now, if you want to write a 
public message or a private message to yourself is completely up to you
but post a message. The first step is to write the message. What you have to 
do is hold down the up/down/left/right key (pick one of them) enough times to
enter at least 85 or more escape sequences (considering of course your using
a terminal program that supports arrow key ANSI movements). Don't bother 
counting them, if you hold your arrow key down for at least 15 seconds
thats more than enough. We haven't bothered to test this with any other 
escape sequences but the arrow keys work nicely. This will fill the message 
with the chosen ANSI sequence. Hit enter after doing this for about 15 
seconds and save your message. Now all you have to do is read the message
you just wrote, reply to it, and when you attempt to quote it, it will lock 
up the system instantly. Pretty simple actually..

	We predict that the reason this locks up the system has something to
do with the 255 character string constant. Since each ANSI sequence (for the
arrow keys) is 3 characters, 3*85=255.

			   IBM's Voice Mail System
				  By ICEMAN


				  Disclaimer
				  ~~~~~~~~~~

As the author of this article, I am not responsible for any actions that may
result from the information in this article. This file is for informational
and educational purposes only, detailing the features of this particular
VMB system. None of this information should not be used without the permission
of the authorized people in charge.


				 Introduction
				 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

I haven't encountered a VMB system such as the one IBM is using in our area
yet, so i've decided to write an article on it. The specific system in this
case is only a local system, and I'm not at all sure if IBM is using it on
any 1-800's that they run. I have heard something about ROLM in the past while
but I haven't been able to get any info on it in time for this issue... maybe
there'll be a part ][ in the next one.

				  
				  First steps
				  ~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have called up the IBM VMB system, a high quality voice will answer
and give you the following options:

o Press 1 if you are using a touchtone phone
o Hold the line if you are using a rotary dial phone

Note that you want to select 1. If you are using a rotary dial phone, get a
touch tone phone. If you hold the line you will be connected to a live
operator, and this defeats the purpose.

Next you will be presented with the following options:

o Press 1 if you know the name of the person you are trying to call
o Press 2 if you want to make a service call
o Press 3 if you would like information on IBM's products or services
o Press 4 if you want to leave a comment about the automated phone system

Now you want to pick option 1, since the whole purpose of your call is to get
into the actual Voice Mail section.


			       Finding Valid VMB's
			       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After choosing 1, you are prompted to enter the persons name of who you want
to reach. You enter the name by using your touch-tone keypad corresponding to
the first 3 letters of the persons last name. If you want to reach someone 
with a last name of Doe, you would enter 363 (DOE). Since the letters Q and Z 
don't appear on standard keypads, use the 7 key for Q and the 9 key for Z.

It will probably be difficult to actually find a valid mail-box, so it may
help by actually calling up the local IBM service department and using some
social engineering skills to get some of the employee names out of the 
operator. Or you could go as far as dumpster diving, but this is probably 
far too much trouble to get a person's name.

After finding 1 valid Mailbox it is easier to scan for others as well. When
the voice asks you to enter the mailbox number, after 2 invalid attempts,
enter one the valid ones which you have found. This will prevent the system
from hanging up on you and you can keep on scanning from there.

Once you have entered a valid name, the system will say something like this: 
'You dialed ', then an actual recording of the persons voice will be 
played, saying his own name, so the result will be 'You have reached John 
Doe'. It sounds a little silly mind you, but at least you've found a valid
Mailbox. It will then ask you if this is correct.

o Press # if it is the correct person.
o Press * if it is incorrect.


			     After You've Found One
			     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now the persons greeting will play, and you will be prompted to enter a
message for them. During the greeting, or during message entry if you press
the 0 key, you will be presented with the following options:

o Press # if you would like to talk to someone taking calls for John Doe
o Press 0 to talk to an operator
o Press * to enter another persons name (VMB)
o Or enter an extension number, to transfer to another extension.

You probably won't need to use any of these functions, so just continue
listening to the greeting. Now it's time to try and get into it by hacking
out the persons personal password. To do this you must first enter a message
to the person, enter a completely blank message, unless you want to harrass
an IBM employee or something (not suggested since you dont want to leave
traces of your visit and this would be very unethical). Once the time has
elapsed, you will be presented with the following options:

o Press 7 then 3 to replay the message
o Press 1 to re-record the message
o Press # to accept and save the message
o Press 6 to erase the message
o Press 7 to disconnect

You now want to delete the message since you don't want to leave any traces 
whatsoever of your visit. When selecting 6 you'll be presented with:

o Press # to continue deletion
o Press 1 to re-record the message

Select # to delete the message and proceed. You will then be presented with
the following options:

o Press 0 to transfer to another extension
o Press # to access the phone mail features

Now we want to access the phone mail features so press #. You will now once
again be prompted to enter an extension or name, once again enter the same
name that you are currently hacking. You now have the following options:

o Press * if this is the incorrect person (Obviously not)
o Enter the password for this Mailbox, then press #

Ah-Hah. We have finally reached the password entry prompt. You now have your
chance to try to enter the correct password try every combination of the VMB
number that you can think of or any other information about the employee that
could be relevant.

These systems are incredibly secure (This is IBM we're dealing with here), and
after 3 invalid password entries, you will be unable to get to the password
entry prompt again. This is a major drawback and will deter all but the 
patient, determined individual. You must wait for the person who owns the
mailbox to talk to the system administrator to 'unlock' the mailbox and then try 
again the next day. The person will probably become extremely paranoid due to
people trying to hack into their mailbox every day, and change their password
often. I'm currently not sure of the length of the password since you are 
able to enter as many digits as you like before pressing the pound key.

The fact that you are only allowed 3 attempts to enter the correct password
seems quite stupid in my opinion since even though you are locked out from
attempting to access the VMB so is the owner of the mailbox. This means that
the owner is unable to read their mail or do anything about it. This could 
become very annoying to them if done repeatedly and would be one way to 
really get on their nerves. There's no telling what IBM can or will do. This
is wasting their time, they could go as far as installing traces since 
this is probably considered mischief. So it may be a good idea to do it from 
a payphone, if you must.


				    Summary
				    ~~~~~~~

Here is a simplified rundown of what to do:

o Call the VMB system
o Press 1 since you have a touch-tone phone
o Press 1 to enter a persons VMB number
o Press # if it's the correct person
o Wait for the greeting to finish, and enter the blank message
o Press 6 to erase the message
o Press # to verify deletion
o Press # to access phone mail features
o Enter the Mailbox number again
o Enter the password then # to complete

After this you are on your own. We have been unable to enter ANY boxes to
date due to the tight security involved.

If you are able to actually get into one of these mailboxes please let us
know or write up a text file explaining the options availible from within.
Considering the options availible on other similar systems, these could range
from Forwarding Messages, Mass Messages, Creating Guest Accounts, Placing
outgoing calls (an outdial), Listening to your Messages (obviously), 
Programming Mailboxes to Call certain phone numbers, and play certain 
messages at specified times, plus may other possible features.

		How to make crystalline methylamphetamine (ICE)

				  ~~~~~~~~~~

  I'm a firm believer in the concept of evolution and natural selection; 
basically, the strong survive and the weak get shit upon. I also believe 
that reality tends to punish those who are stupid. If you DON'T thoroughly 
understand working with ALL of these concepts, please don't try this...well, 
if you kill yourself, the IQ of the average human being will be that much
greater.

				  Forward We Go
				  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Materials: 95-100% ethanol, Sodium Borohydride, 250 ml round bottom glass 
flask, reflux condenser, rubber tubing, Sudafed nasal decongestant capsules
( VERY IMPORTANT ), glass extraction funnel, 1 molar Sodium Hydroxide, 
anhydrous Sodium Sulfate, diethyl ether, Safety goggles(!!!!), Safety shield
( plexiglass...1-2" thick ), Safety apron and gloves. It's also advisable to 
have a dry chemical fire extinguisher available at all times. Blue and red 
litmus paper, and about a litre of saturated salt solution (1 gram per 23 
mls).

Where do I get all this shit? Steal it from your high school, or buy it at a
laboratory supply house (none of these materials are prohibited or restricted
in any way!)

Why make this stuff?: Because it's an illegal drug. You can get really wacked 
on the stuff if you're stupid enough to use it. It's probably quite fun if 
you're into death and that kinda shit.

Theory: You will perform a catalytic dehydrogenolysis on pseudoephedrine, 
converting it into methylamphetamine (speed, ice, or glass are common names).

Structure of synthesis: This procedure is broken up into two parts; 
1) the production and purification of pseudoephedrine free base.
2) the production and purification of methylamphetamine free base.

  
	The production and purification of pseudoepehdrine free base 
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Buy sudafed capsules; the more the merrier!
 
Method: Take 10 sudafed capsules apart, and place the little round granules 
into a clean dish. These granules contain the pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 
and inorganic filler. Crush the granules until they are no more than a very 
fine powder. I suggest using the 100 milligram capsules at this point. 
Approximate end yield will be roughly 1 gram of product.

	Place 100 mls of room temperature water into the extraction funnel, 
and CAREFULLY add all of the powdder into the funnel. Place a cap on the 
funnel, invert, and open the stopcock. MAKE SURE YOU ARE WEARING YOUR SAFETY 
GOGGLES AT THIS POINT! Swirl the funnel around to dissolve the material. 
There will be a significant amount of undissolved white powder; do not be
concerned, this is inorganic filler. After 10 mins of shaking, dip a glass 
rod into the liquid and touch the drop on the tip of the stirring rod to a 
piece of moist BLUE litmus paper. The litmus paper should turn red where it 
has been touched. This means that the solution is acidic, and that a 
significant proportion of the pseudoephedrine hydrochloride has in fact 
dissolved in the water. If the litmus paper has turned red, you can go on to 
the next step. If not, repeat he shaking 5 more minutes until the litmus 
paper does turn red. 

Add 50 mls of diethyl ether to the separation funnel. BE VERY CAREFUL AT THIS
STAGE. MAKE SURE YOU ARE WORKING IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA AND PLEASE DON'T 
DO SOMETHING FUCKING STUPID LIKE SMOKE CIGARETTES OR YOU DESERVE WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN! YOU DESERVE TO GET LUNG CANCER OR HAVE YOUR FUCKING FACE BLOWN OFF! 
The diethyl ether is less dense than the water solution and will float on top.
Add 10 mls of the 1 molar sodium hydroxide, cap the funnel, invert and 
IMMEDIATELY release the stopcock to vent off the gas that forms. Point the 
end of the funnel AWAY from your eyes! Periodically swirl and vent the funnel 
to release any gas. When no more gas is given off after venting, draw off a 
little of the liquid from the lower layer into a thimble. Test it with a piece
of moist RED litmus paper. If it stays red, add 10 more mls of the sodium 
hydroxide solution, invert funnel, swirl and vent until no more gas is given 
off. Repeat this UNTIL the red litmus paper turns blue. At this stage, the 
water solution is basic, the pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is in the free base
form, and is located entirely within the diethyl ether layer.

	  Draw off the lower water layer and discard it. Pour off the ether 
layer into a beaker with 10 grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sodium 
sulfate is a drying agent and will remove most of the water that is in the 
ether solution (very little really since ether is non polar and water is very 
polar). Cap the beaker with a piece of saran wrap and let it sit in a well 
ventilated COOL area overnite (not the fridge). Don't smoke within 2 miles of 
this. Ether is FLAMMABLE and forms EXPLOSIVE peroxides which tend to 
spontaneously detonate.

	  Decant off the ether into a dry round bottom flask. Heat this flask
over a pot of very hot water. This will take only a few minutes to evaporate. 
You will be left with a clear syrupy liquid that looks like childrens tylenol 
drops. This is the pure pseudoephedrine free base. If you have a death wish, 
you can try some now (scoop it up with a spoon, a toothpick, etc). Swallow 
it, or put it on a cigarette and smoke it. I don't care. You're stupid if you 
do.

		   
		   Production of methylamphetamine free base
		   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	  Add the 95% ethanol or everclear drop by drop until the sludge is 
dissolved. It should go into solution very easily. I doubt it if many people 
will be able to get 100% ethanol, but the purer the better, since trace 
amounts of water inhibit the next step in the preparation.

	  Total volume should not exceed 50 mls at this point. You can make 
the solution up to 50 mls if you wish. VERY carefully add 1 gram of sodium 
borohydride to the solution, add the relux condensor to the top of the round 
bottom flask, and start to boil the mixture (eg, on a hot plate...NOT on an 
open flame. The cold water going thru the reflux condensor will keep the 
ethanol from evaporating, yet the high temperature of the reaction vessel will
allow the reaction to go forward as desired. Let this go for about 4 hours. 
Take away from the hot plate and let cool slowly to room temperature. 

	  AFTER the solution has cooled to room temperature, add 50 mls of 
saturated salt solution. At this point, you should see little oil drops 
floating on the surface of the liquid. This is methylamphetamine. Add 50 mls 
of diethyl ether to the COOLED flask( room temperature is ok ). Transfer the 
contents to a separatory funnel, cap, invert, and IMMEDIATELY open the 
stopcock. Some gas will escape. Close the stopcock, gently swirl, and open to 
vent off and gas. Repeat until no more pressure developes after 5-10 seconds 
of gentle agitation.  

	  Draw off the lower layer and set aside for a moment. Drain the upper
ether layer into a beaker containing 10 grams of sodium sulfate. Add the layer
that you had set aside BACK to the separatory funnel, and add another 50 mls 
of ether. Cap, invert, vent, etc until NO more pressure developes. Drain off 
the lower water layer and discard. Drain the ether layer into the beaker with 
the first portion of ether. Cover this with saran wrap and let sit over nite.

	  Decant the ether solution into a clean beaker and gently heat this 
over very hot water. As the ether evaporates( please use good ventilation ), 
you will be left with a beige sludge. This beige sludge is methylamphetamine. 
You can do two things at this stage; i) Prepare 'glass' for smoking or 
freebasing (very fucking stupid), or prepare crystal meth for shooting up 
(very very fucking stupid). 
     
     i) if you want to prepare solid ice, stick the beaker in the freezer, 
       and hope that crystal formation starts. If it doesn't, take 5 or 6 
       chemistry course and you'll learn where you fucked up.

     ii) if you want to prepare `crystal' for shooting up, dissolve the beige 
	ice in about 10 mls of anhydrous (very dry) diethyl ether. Add ethereal
	HCL drop by drop. After each drop, you'll see a little white suspension
	form. This is methylamphetamine hydrochloride. Add ethereal HCL until 
	no more white powder forms. You could then decant off any ether, and 
	let the powder dry on tinfoil or whatever. This should be 90% pure.

Reliabilty of this synthetic method: It works, and in a lab, you can go from 
starting material to finished product in about 8 hours IF you know what 
you're doing (and you probably don't). To the best of my knowledge, this has 
never been published, but the general reaction scheme of catalyic 
hydrogenolysis is well documented. At ALL stages, glassware should be kept 
very dry.

		       How to make a Miniature Pipe Bomb
				By Lazarus Long


	This device is not a weapon of terrorism like a genuine pipe bomb.  
It is essentially just a firecracker, a very loud firecracker, that can 
mangle a finger or two if you aren't careful. First, I will advise you to go 
out and buy a pound of Pyrodex. This is a smokeless powder sold at most 
gun/hunting supply stores for roughly $15 (Canadian) per pound.  It is an 
exceptionally versatile explosive as it is less sensitive to friction and 
impact, and it also does not absorb moisture as readily, as other similar
compounds like black powder.  Pyrodex is also exceptionally easy to make into
simple fuses.  A pound will last a long time depending on how you use it.

	What you will need:
	
	o A Papermate Flexgrip pen
	o Pyrodex
	o A couple cotton balls
	o A fuse

	
			   Part 1 - Making Fuses
			   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	For those of you that don't know how to make fuses out of pyrodex I 
will explain this first.  Mix some pyrodex into a small amount of water until
you have a thin paste, it shouldn't be too thick or too watery.  Take a cotton
ball and stretch it into a long string.  Coat this string with the paste and 
loosely pull it through your fingers to scrape off excess paste (do not 
flatten the fuse).  Place on a cookie pan (use wax paper, or place them on 
the back of the pan), aluminum foil, or other similar surface.  Keep making 
these until you run out of paste, there is no need to let it go to waste.  
Bake in your oven at 250 degrees until the fuse is stiff.  When ready it will 
be both stiff and dry, and have a steel grey appearance.  Try not to bend this 
fuse as areas that incur bends will sometimes fail.
	
	This is the most expedient method I have found and, except for the 
Pyrodex, requires items frequently already in the home.  Using the same 
principles you can also use cotton string, or even toilet paper (toilet paper 
is not recommended).  My last bit of advice: never bake a large amount of 
fuses at once.  Although powders like Pyrodex don't explode unless confined, 
they do burn.  I have never had any problems with the above method, but 
caution should always be used.
	
	
			     Part ][ - The Bomb
			     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Now to the mini pipe bomb itself.  The Papermate Flexgrip pen is the 
perfect container for such an explosive.  They are, unfortunately, fairly 
expensive as pens go, so except for one or two experimental bombs you are 
going to want to use them first (fortunately the Flexgrip is also one of the 
best pens out there). The reason it is such a good container is that, like a 
pipe bomb, both ends are screw on, one of which has a hole the perfect size
for a fuse.  The rest of the container has no holes in it, unlike the cheap 
Bic pens.
	
	First take out the ink cartridge, you don't need it anymore. Second, 
unscrew the metal end out of which the writing part formerly jutted.  Insert 
the fuse through the hole starting from the inside and pulling out, remember 
to avoid bending the fuse too much.  Leave enough fuse on the inside to just 
barely reach above the threads on the metal cone.  You should then screw this 
metal end back onto the pen.  Now fill the pen with Pyrodex nearly to the top.  
Tap the pen with your finger to eliminate air pockets.  Fill again if 
necessary.  Finally put some cotton in the top of the pen, and the hollow 
part of the screw on top.  Screw the top back into place.  You now have a 
miniature pipe bomb.  When firing this off you don't want to be nearby, it 
produces a fair amount of shrapnel, and a very loud bang.  Use a long fuse.

	When making this using Pyrodex is advised.  If you choose to use black
powder or match heads (match heads are dumb!) be VERY careful when screwing on 
the top piece that you don't have any powder in the threads.  You should be 
wary of this even when using Pyrodex but it isn't nearly as dangerous.  I've 
made over two dozen of these and had no problems whatsoever, except for the 
occasional failed fuse.  If the fuse fails don't approach the bomb for at
least five to ten minutes.  When you recover it you will have to empty the 
Pyrodex and start over with a new fuse.
	
	This mini pipe bomb with the cap on looks just like a pen without 
alterations and could be rigged into a booby trap if necessary (ie. placing 
the pen cap back on in a way that would light a very short fuse when removed).  
Pen booby traps such as these, although not made in the same fashion, were 
used as antipersonal devices by Germans against the British.  The idea behind
such a booby trap is not usually to kill, but to maim, thus taking the enemy 
personnel out of action and forcing the enemy to expend resources on medical 
care.  To be used for recreational purposes though the fuse should be too 
long to place the cap on properly and therefore doesn't look nearly as 
innocent.

Hopefully this makes it in on time to be a part of the LANDMARK issue one of
Freedom, and furthermore I hope to be a regular contributor.  See you soon...

			      Hackers in Winnipeg?
				   by ICEMAN

After hearing about my friend having his computer confiscated for crashing
a board, I was astonished... even more astonishing was what came a few days
later. An article on the FRONT page of our local paper, on his story. A
little extreme in my opinion...

Following is the article which appeared on the front page of the Winnipeg         
Free Press, on November 26, 1992.

	 STAFF THREATENED, FILES RUINED AS TEEN COMPUTER WHIZ STRIKES

				By George Nikides
				 Staff Reporter
     
     A teen hacker uncovered a hole in a downtown software shop's computer 
system and went on a rampage, destroying every file and threatening employees.
     " It's an ego thing. 'Boy look what i've accomplished,' " said Sgt. 
Dennis Loupin of the Winnipeg police fraud unit.
     " He's very, very intelligent. He's got a tremendous future in the
computer world. "
     An 18 year-old, who can't be named because he's charged under the Young
Offender's Act, faces fraud charges.
     Police say a hacker discovered a "hole" - an opening that allows a user
to circumvent a computer system's passwords - in the bulletin board program
at Adventure Software Ltd., a Hargrave Street software shop.
     The computer whiz unlocked the program several times, at one point
destroying every file.

				 Bulletin Board

     The hacking is believed to have been carried out with an IBM-style 
computer from a home.
     Adventure Software offers a computer bulletin board where customers can
communicate, read about news products, or leave messages from their home 
systems.
     The system has about 400 users, police say.
     An Adventure Software employee, who asked not to be identified, said
threatening messages were left in the system, some suggesting that selling
software was immoral. Some messages attacked a store employee.
     The system was out of operation at one point for 3 1/2 weeks, he said.
     But the employee said police are overstating the hacker's skills.
     " It doesn't take a genius to hear about a 'hole' in the program," said
the man.
     The system was infiltrated four to six times, he said.
     " It's not crippling. It's just extremely annoying, " the employee said.
     By breaking into the system the computer bandit found home phone numbers
and addresses, he said.
     Police say they are also investigating the teen in connection with 
break-ins at other systems across North America.

				    Mischief

     " He's now going to have to face the consequences of something he 
thought was just a challenge but it's more than that - it's a crime, " said
Loupin.
     A Victor Street teenager was arrested Tuesday night and charged with
using a computer service to commit mischief, an offence that carries a
maximum 10-year sentence.
     The teen is now 18, but police say he was 17 when the alleged crimes 
occured.

I decided to ask him a few questions about how he fellt about it, and that's
what follows. He didn't want any of his other aliases mentioned, so we
decided to use one which he uses on private boards.

			 FR=Freedom   BL=Big Leacher

FR: Can you give us a brief rundown of the events that happened on November
    24th 1992?

BL: Oh nothing really, just the police department came down and confiscated
    my system, thats about the only thing that happened. I was also taken
    down for questioning.

FR: Do you feel that the Free Press highly exploited your story?

BL: Yes, they seem to want to sell papers, more than tell the truth. The 
    Winnipeg Sun told a more realistic story.

FR: Can you justify Duncan Falconer's (Adventure Software employee) statement
    that it took them 120 hours to setup their system again?

BL: No, and I don't think Duncan could either, he's bullshitting, and even
    lamers know it couldn't take that long.

FR: What do you expect will come out of this? Do you expect to be charged?
    (Just a note that no charges have yet been laid, only a computer was
     confiscated)

BL: I expect to be charged, but it's no sweat, it was a stupid thing to do.
    Better yet, an even stupider thing to get caught for.

FR: Did you learn anything from this experience?

BL: Not really.. just that the police are good at tracing, and that you should
    allways have a failsafe for the data on your computer.

FR: Will you continue hacking after this is all over?

BL: Hack? Naaaaah.. would never get caught doing something as bad as that
    again. :)

FR: What do you think was meant by the statement saying you were being
    investigated in connection with other break-ins across North America?

BL: I had access to many boards through Internet and other LD places. Also
    I was/am in a group which believes in the freedom of expression, so I
    think they are trying to key me as the leader of this group. I didn't
    hack other systems, just Adventure Software, because I had a score to
    settle with an employee there.

FR: What do you mean when you said you 'had a score to settle'?

BL: The sysop of Adventure Software and I had dealings in the past which 
    cause alot of negativity in my family. I no longer hold a grudge.

FR: Do you feel any sympathy towards Adventure Software?

BL: No.. why? Selling software for the prices they do is wrong, since kids
    use games, they'll get them any way they can. There should be a copying
    fee, and that's all. 

FR: What do you think of the fact that this is our city's first computer crime
    investigation?

BL: It's cool, if I was still a youth, I would love the publicity of this,
    but i've turned 18 after the crime, so I can't state how I 'really' 
    feel. :)

FR: Will you continue to BBS after this is over?

BL: Of course, this is nothing, and I'm both amused and suprised of the
    publicity it has received (i.e. Free Press, Sun, Cud) and possibly
    more as the case goes on.

FR: Is there anything else you want to say to ours readers?

BL: Yeah, hacking a bbs sucks, go for new things, and allways watch your ass.
    Damn I need a modem, anyone wanna donate a C64 compatible one? Get in
    touch with ICEMAN. Anyways i'll be back in a few months. 

Well that's all...
