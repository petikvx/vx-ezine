				 Introduction
				 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Welcome to issue 2 of Freedom, thanks to everyone who submitted to
the first issue, and this one. I'll keep this intro short, since I don't have
much to say.

	There's been a new section added which i've called Tidbits, that
basically consists of small articles that weren't appropriate to put in
separately. If you have something that you feel isn't worth writing a full
fledged article on, it can be included in this section.

	If you would like to submit an article, or get a hold of me, either
call one of the boards listed hereafter or send it via internet e-mail to
freedom@silicon.bison.mb.ca.

			    Northern Telecom SL-1
				  by ICEMAN

	This article is fairly lengthy, but I felt that it was worth including
all the information that I did, even though a great deal of it is useless to
someone attempting to take advantage of such a system. If you have any
interest in learning about PBX's, then in my opinion it's worth reading in
it's entirety. Just a note that you can't expect to learn this all in one
sitting, it takes time and experience. I would say that about 50% of this
material was taken from other sources, ranging from Northern Telecom manuals,
to classroom handouts used to educate those who work with them. Although most
of the technical information is straight out of the book, I did my best to
simplify it as much as I could, so that the reader can get a better grasp on
it.

	Development of Northern Electric's SL-1 started in 1971. Their
objective was to design a superior communications system for business 
subscribers in the range of 100 to 7600 stations. The system had to encompass
all the features of a PBX, Centrex and key systems and be economically
competitive with them. It had to have new custom services not previously
feasible with the older systems. It had to be easy to learn and to operate.
As well, it had to be easy to install and maintain.

	What the designers came up with was a digital, stored program control
machine using an 8-bit PCM. They also came up with a new telephone instrument,
the SL-1 telephone, which is a multi-line instrument with many features, but
uses only 2 pairs of wires, instead of 25 pairs required by key telephones.

	The SL-1 system has three main parts: The common equipment (CE), the
peripheral equipment (PE) and the power supplies.

	The CE performs the central control and switching functions for all
the connecting lines and trunks. It has a central processing unit (CPU) and
read/write memory which stores all the operating programs and data unique
to the particular system, including switching sequences, feature and class
of service information, and numbers and types of terminals. It also has a
magnetic tape unit for high-speed loading of the operating programs and data
into the R/W memory, providing data restoral after a power failure. The tape
also contains the diagnostic routines. There is a Teletype to communicate to
the system with and to print error messages on. The network circuits perform
the switching duties for all lines and trunks. The digital service circuits
provide for such functions as dial and ringing tones and call conferencing.

	The CE units communicate over a common central bus under control of
the CPU. Speech signals, converted to digital, follow a separate path on a
network switching bus.

	The PE performs the interface between the line and trunk circuits and
the SL-1 system. It consists mainly of line and trunk cards which convert
analog speech to digital signals for digital switching and vice versa. Lines
connect to individual instruments and trunks to other PBX's. Peripheral 
buffers act as interface between the PE and the CE providing power control,
timing and switching control signals for the line and trunk circuits. Digital
conversion into 8-bit PCM is done by a single encoder/decoder (codec) for each
line or trunk. This codec is a custom LSI circuit.

	Between the PE and the CE, all signals travel in digital format on 
time multiplexed loops. Each loops carriers 30 voice channels, one control
signalling channel and one unused channel. The channels operate at 64 kbps
to give a total data rate of 2.048 mbps. Each loops terminates on a different
circuit pack in the CE. There can be up to 16 multiplex loops.

	When a call is set up, the CPU assigns each party a channel from among
the 30 on their own multiplex loops. These channels form a matched pair. For
instance, the calling party may use channel 2 of it's digital loop, and the
called party may use channel 3 of it's loop.

	The SL-1 conducts audio digitally. The line and trunk cards contain
A/D and D/A converters. Received audio is changed to a digital signal and
put on a voice channel. At it's destination, the digital signal is converted
back to analog audio.

	All programming is done from a keyboard with the output going to a
printer. To program, a specific diagnostic is selected, and is automatically
loaded from tape. Once this is done, the appropriate commands are entered to
change the options. All typing is echoed on the printer and the SL-1's
responses are printed out. If any system parameters or configurations are 
changed, these changes will not survive a total power outage unless a new
tape is made.

	In case of a power outage, upon restoral of power, the SL-1 activates
the tape unit and loads in the system operating data, and runs some 
diagnostics. This takes from 5-15 minutes, and at the end of that time,
service is fully restored with all the options which were recorded on the tape
being implemented. Of course any user-selected options like speed call lists 
and call waiting which had been selected before the outage will be lost.

	Automatic diagnostics (called 'background' programs) are being run
constantly with the results of any problems being printed out. At midnight
a more thorough set of diagnostics are run. Any of the diagnostics may be
run on demand from the keyboard. Also available on demand from the keyboard
are a series of diagnostics to determine the status of lines and trunks, to
trace calls, and to print lists and traffic studies.

			Explanation of Some Features
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Station to station calling - Any station can directly call any other station
without attendant assistance.

Direct Outward Dialing (DOD) - Allows a station to gain access to the exchange
network without attendant assistance and receives a second dialtone.

Hunting - Routes a call to an idle station directory number when the called
number is busy. The numbers in the hunt group do not have to be in sequence
nor do they have to appear on the same instrument. The sequence can be
consecutive (station directory numbers are hunted in ascending numerical
order) or non-consecutive.

Access to paging - Provides a connection to customer-owned paging equipment.

Access to Automatic Recorded Answering Equipment - SL-1 stations can have
incoming messages recorded on customer-provided answering equipment by
forwarding calls to the directory number (DN) assigned to the equipment.

Direct Inward Dialing (DID) - Allows an incoming call from the exchange
network to reach a station without attendant assistance. The DN for each
station will normally be the last 2,3 or 4 digits of the 7 digit exchange
network number.

Tandem Switching - The SL-1 can act as an intermediate switching point for
traffic between other PBX's.

Manual Service - Does not provide a dialtone when a station goes off-hook.
Instead the attendant is alerted and completes the call for the user.

Private Line Service - Permits the appearance of a private central office line
on an SL-1 Telephone set. Dialtone is received directly from the telco and
calls are not processed by the SL-1.

Multi-Customer Group Operation - Allows for the provision of services for more
than one business customer from the same switching machine. Each customer
is totally separate from the others, may have the same directory numbers as
the others, has his own attendant console, his own trunks, and cannot directly
call stations belonging to the other customers.

Service Restrictions - Allows the ability to restrict various functions.

Intercept - Disposes of calls which cannot be completed because of 
restrictions or dialing errors. They are either routed to the attendant
or overflow tone.

Special Dial Tone - A Regular dialtone with three 128 ms interruptions at the
beginning to advise the user that his hookswitch flash has been successful.

Line Lockout - Disconnects stations which have been off-hook for too long to
prevent system problems.

Night Service - Allows the attendant to preconnect some or all of the incoming
telco trunks to selected DN's on the SL-1.

Emergency Transfer - Puts the system in the power fail transfer mode. This
transfers telco trunks to selected stations to provide some continuity of
service to the outside world during the time the SL-1 is inoperative.

Remote Administration and Maintenance - Permits operation of the diagnostics
from a remote location via a modem and telephone line. You may do anything
from the remote terminal that you can do from the local terminal.

Call Forward - Busy - Routes incoming calls to another number when the called
station is busy.

Call Forward - Don't answer - Routes incoming calls to another number when the
called station doesn't answer within a prescribed time.

Call Forward - Follow me - Routes incoming calls to another, programmable
number.

Call Waiting - Informs the user of a second incoming call while he is already
in conversation. He can then place the first caller on hold and answer the
second call. He can then return to the first call.

Conference - Allows a user to connect up to either 1 or 4 additional persons
into an existing call. Up to 2 of the users may be trunks.

Call Pickup - Allows a station to answer an incoming call to another station
in the same pickup group by dialing a special code.

Ring Again - Permits a calling station, on encountering a busy DN, to operate
a dedicated key or dial a special code to have the system monitor the called
station and alert him when it goes idle. He is then automatically connect to
that station when he goes off-hook or presses the key during the alert and the
system rings that station.

Data Transmission - The SL-1 is suitable for voiceband data transmissions
and is compatible with a conventional modem.

'Generic' refers to the software version. It is expressed as a 3 or 4 digit
number where the first part of the number indicates the machine it is for
and the second part indicates the purpose of the software and serves as a 
version number and also indicates the type of machine it can be used with. The
'X' stands for a 1 or 2 digit number representing the model:

1 = SL1-L     2 = SL1-VL     3 = SL1-LE     4 = SL1-VLE     5 = SL1-A
6 = SL1-XL    7 = SL1-M/S    8 = SL1-N      9 = SL1-XN      10= SL1-ST
11= SL1-NT    12= SL1-XT

			    Maintenance Programs
			    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	All troubleshooting procedures, configuration changes and circuit
disabling/enabling are carried out from the keyboard of a Teletype via 
software programs. There is virtually no physical contact with the exchange
other than required to remove a defective board and replace it with a spare.
Even this does not require tools.

	This material will give only a brief description of each program and
some examples of how to use them.

	Before running a program you must first gain access to the computer.
The dialup will normally be a 1200 baud connection, with an even parity,
databits of 7, and stopbits of 1 (E71). Once connected press the 'return'
key to wake the system up. The system SHOULD respond with 'OVL111 BKGD' or
'OVL111 IDLE' and now you know it's alright to login. If the response is
'OVL000' and then a '>' prompt you are already logged in, and you can go
straight to loading an overlay.

	Type 'LOGI' to initiate the login. Make sure when entering commands
that they are all input in uppercase. The system responds with 'PASS?'. Now
enter the password. The default password is '0000' but is obviously
configurable. If you have correctly logged in, the system will respond with
a '>' prompt. The system will display this prompt whenever waiting for
operator input and is not running a diagnostic program. Once a diagnostic
program is running the prompt becomes a '.' (period). If you are not logged
in, there is no prompt.

	What follows is an example of what you will see during login.

	Now after gaining this information, we can determine what type of
system we're dealing with. Notice that the version number is 1011. Now
refer back to the listing of SL-1 Models for the information we seek. We are
logged into an x11 system (last 2 digits of the version number). Unfortunately,
there are two system with x11 generics, and none of which have a release
number of 14, so we're either dealing with an SL1-M or an SL1-S, with either a
60-400 or 30-160 line capability respectively. Although this information isn't
extremely useful, it comes in handy when determining how large the system is.


			      Overlay Programs
			      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Upon first logging in, no program is loaded, and you must load a
program (overlay) into system memory. This is done by the command 'LD'
followed by a space and the overlay number. To load overlay 10 you would
simply do a 'LD 10'. It will take approximately 1 minute to load the overlay
into memory from tape, if the system uses a tape drive. If the system uses
other methods of storage (disks, ROM) then it will load quickly. Once the
program is loaded, a 'REQ' (request) prompt will appear. The system is now
waiting for input from the user.

	There are many different overlays which can be used, all of which
are explained in the following section.

				 Programming
				 ~~~~~~~~~~~

	The following few sections will summarize the possible commands and
responses for various overlays. Since there are various models of SL-1's as
well as various software versions running on them, there are bound to be
differences in the commands, to accommodate this, notice the 'generic' heading.
If 'all' appears under this heading, then the following command/prompt is
found in all models/versions, otherwise it only appears in the models/versions
that are specified under this column. Once an overlay is loaded, the first
prompt will appear. For example when overlay 10 is loaded, the 'REQ' prompt
will appear, and you will choose the appropriate response, in this case the
choices are 'NEW','CHG','MOV','OUT', and 'END', then the next prompt will
appear and so on. Note that not all prompts will appear for all versions,
but i've done my best to include possible prompts that you can come across.
When entering input, if you make a mistake and would like the system to
disregard the current line, end the line with a '*' then a carriage return.
If you make a mistake, and would like to return to the beginning of the
input routine, enter '**' at the end of the line, followed by a carriage
return, and you will return to the 'REQ' (request) prompt.

	Those are the main overlays used to modify setups and print the system

SL-1's are mainly used in buildings, ranging from department stores to
large office complexes. The dialups are commonly found off of an extension
of the PBX, I've come across several while scanning for VMB's, which are
becoming more common in stores every day. I've never however come across
one while exchange scanning, and I really don't think you would find many
this way.

	Anyways have fun, and remember, knowing is half the battle.

		    How to reduce taxes, eliminate welfare,
		    and reduce organ donor shortages at no
		    cost to honest hardworking individuals

				       by
				   Vox Populii


	Has it ever bugged you that as a tax paying citizen in this fine
nation of ours that *YOU* have to pay for non productive fucking leeches who
sit at home all day, swilling beer, playing nintendo and generally whacking
off? I know I'm pissed off! 1/3 of my income goes to pay for social programs,
and it makes me as mad as hell that I'm forced to subsidize loozers( yeah
that's right, and if you find this antagonistic, I guess you know what I
think of you so piss off, format your hard drive, do the world a favor and
go crawl in a corner and fucking die already ).

	To the extent that the following issues represent serious problems, 
I offer solutions. These *are* workable, if our society had the balls to 
implement em. Typically however, thoughts like these are known to cause 
severe angst in yuppies. We can only wish that this paradise would come 
about!

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	1. Jails are overcrowded( why should we pay for luxury 
	accommodations for these freaks? ).

	2. We have a shortage of organ donors

	3. Our society is not strong enough( think of imperial 
	Rome, where it was not unusual for the average citizen 
	to see bloodshed each and every day ). Eventually, our 
	way of life will degenerate or rot.

	4. We don't have enough entertainment( or the 
	entertainment is not intense enough...take your pick ).

	5. People who aren't productive can get by just by 
	sucking on the public tit.
	
	6. We pay way too much FUCKING TAXES!

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	Did any of that get you mad? Did it make your blood boil? If it did, 
then I've got respect for you. If it didn't, well...fuck off and die. I've 
got more respect for someone working at McDonalds then for someone collecting
welfare. At least the person working at McDick's is contributing something
to society by virtue of participating in the social order.

	The first plan will virtually eliminate welfare overnite AND provide 
fresh supplies of organs and bodies for medical experimentation. It operates 
under the principle that while people are lazy( and none more so than the 
people on welfare )there is only so high a price that people will pay for 
'free' stuff. To this end, I have segregated people on welfare into three 
categories; 
		
		i) People who can work, but don't want to.
	       ii) People who can work, but have been unable to
		   find jobs.
	      iii) People who are unable to work for 
		   whatever reason( physical or mental 
		   disability )

Class i)
~~~~~~~~
	
	Fuck em. Let them rot, or kick them out of Canada. You might even want
to send em up to Baffin Island. We *all* know someone like this. It's your
typical person who goes and buys booze with his/her welfare cheque, goes on
a week long drunk, and then ends up robbing someone to buy more booze. I'd be
tempted to say let the law of the jingle take care of em if it weren't for
the fact that these type of people would probably wait outside your door to
mug you. Shooting's too good for them, but lest I be accused of inhumaity, I
say ship the bums off to er Somolia? Yeah, and then see how long they survive
( note: banishment was used in Ancient Greece ). If someone can't work, that's
neither my concern nor yours. So what if these people start hanging around on
the streets; we can ship them away. In the event they *don't* want to go away,
they go into the arena's( see below please ).   

Class ii) 
~~~~~~~~~

	Unfortunately, the government has fucked us all over to the point 
where the economy is a shambles, and there are those of us who *would* work,
but are unable to find jobs. Still, pathetic forms of mercy are no reason to 
shell out *YOUR* hard earned dollars. Class ii individuals could easily slip 
to class one individuals. Therefore, I propose that in exchange for a 
subsistence level of food and shelter, these people be forced to work on 
public projects( e.g. highway repairs, street repairs, cleanup, snow removal,
etc ). For as long as work is available in the public sector, and as long as
these people are willing to accept a demeaning level of existence, I see no
reason why we should not exploit them as a cheap source of labor. However,
lest these individuals come to see 'Big brother' as a provider, they should be
made to attempt job location at least once a month. In any event, when there
is no public work available, I'd kick these people off. Still, these people
are more respectable than class i people.

Class iii) 
~~~~~~~~~~

	This is the most problematic group of people to be dealt with; it
includes physically handicapped people, and individuals who are mentally
retarded. They may or may not wish to work( not that anyone would necessarily
wish to hire them ), nor may they even have an idea of what is constituted by
the concept of work. How do you deal with someone who is labelled as a
perpetual loser in society? How do you do this without appearing to be
inhumane? I'm not a nazi, nor would I wish to see people suffer unnecessarily
( those who deserve to suffer...well... ) If you accept that the jobs are
neither available for this group of people, nor could they fill such jobs if
they were in fact available, what is the incentive for society to sustain
their lives. I.e. what is the motivation for *YOU* Mr. taxpayer to shell out
some of his/her hard earned dollars to keep a non productive person alive?
	
	There is none.....UNLESS they participate in my schemata of voluntary
organ donations. In my extreme generosity, I am willing to allow these 
individuals to receive subsistence assistance from the state( fuck is that an
annoying term )in exchange for being placed on an organ donor bank. 
	
	What I propose is that each month, 8.25% of welfare recipients have
their names chosen at random. Those who are chosen are killed, and their
blood, tissue, skin, etc( i.e. all biologically useful substances )are placed
in storage or immediately given for transplant. The 8.25% represents a 
theoretical breakpoint such that any recipient of welfare( if he or she is
truly so lazy or desperate )has only a 50% chance of still 'being in the
program' after a six month period. Work out what 91.75% raised to the sixth 
power is...

	Quite obviously we would not expect people to meekly march to their
deaths after having 'their number' come up, so what I propose is that 
hospitals become welfare distribution centers. On any given day of the month,
approximately 3.33% of total welfare recipients would go to the hospital, be
strapped in a chair, and play the lottery of life (grin), at which point they
would have a 91.75% chance of receiving social assistance, and an 8.25% chance
of being taken for science. If they have the misfortune to draw a ticket, they 
would be mercifully put unconscious and then cut up for immediate use or 
storage.
	
	The interesting thing about this plan is that it assures us of a 
constant supply of fresh organs each and every day. No more blood bank
shortages. And my fellow taxpayer, LESS sucking at the public tit. YOUR taxes
go down. It's purely voluntary, with no one forced to participate. The only 
point of no return is after someone has drawn a random number. Additionally,
this would tend to strengthen our society, for our weakest members tend to be
the ones receiving social assistance.

______________________________________________________________________________

	
	The second problem that I wish to deal with is overcrowding in our
jail systems. They're overflowing with people, the courts are backlogged with
the most trivial of offenses, the parole system lets hardened criminals out
far too early, and some mass murderer who has raped and killed a dozen kids
gets luxury accommodations for years( while we have to spend OUR money to buy
a turkey for Christmas, these low life scum get to eat for free ).

	This plan operates under the principal that humans are greedy( and
particularly the unintelligent amongst us are greedy; not quite understanding
that you have to work for what you get in life ).

	I propose that for each individual who has committed a felony offense,
they have the offense of working off a portion of their sentence in the
following fashion; if a person has a 10 year sentence, he( or she ) may elect
to enter into the arena for a fight to the death with another convict( who
has also voluntarily elected to enter into the arena ). On each Friday of the
week, a set of such fights is held at the biggest public arena in each state
capital. Contestants are allowed to choose from a variety of weapons with
which to attempt to kill their opponents; ranging from knives to flails, etc.
The victor of said match would receive a one year reduction from his jail
term, while the loser is snuffed out. The person who( for example )had a ten
year sentence would now only have a nine year sentence. To have the jail term
reduced to zero, this person would have to win ten such matches. At any stage
in the process, he/she may drop out( an interesting modification might be to
have one criminal fight two; if the single man won, he would receive a 2 year
reduction, if the pair won, they would receive a 1/2 year reduction ).

	Some curious points to be noted about this proposal are;
		
		-the shorter a period of time a person is to be incarcerated,
		 the less likely they would risk the 'games'.
		
		-It doesn't really matter if a mass murderer has been let 
		 free( e.g. Jeffery Dahmer has a 125 year sentence ), because
		 in order to become free, he must kill 125 other scum. I would
		 say this person has done a great service to society then.
		
	The only stipulation I would like to add is that the Gladiator fights
will have a no tie rule imposed upon them. The contestants are to understand 
in advance that ties are not acceptable. A contestant may however opt to pull
out of a fight with the following penalty; one year will be added to his
sentence for cowardice. The opposing contestant is not penalized, but is
neither rewarded. In the event of such an act of cowardice though, the
remaining contestant has first right of rematch with this person. Should the
'withdrawing' gladiator refuse to refight within a one year period, 10 years
shall be added to his sentence.

	Upon being victorious for the 20th time( e.g. if the criminal had a 
20 year sentence ), a criminal shall be judged to have paid fully and 
completely for his crimes against society. On that instant , he shall be
declared a free man with a complete pardon( as opposed to parole ). In order
to expedite his return to society, he shall be awarded a one time sum of
10,000$ paid by admission tickets to the fights.

			   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Public executions: 

	All executions of criminals shall take place in public, with the right
of execution decided upon by voluntary participation in a lottery. The person
whose name/number is drawn gets to decide the method of execution of the 
convicted criminal. Methods are to include hanging, shooting , electrocution
and beheading. Public executions are to be televised by all stations that
wish to do so. Imperial Rome had it's 'bread and circuses', and it was
considered to be quite civilized. At one time, it was the zenith of 
civilization on this planet.

	Of course, we could expect all sorts of civil libertarians to snivel
and whine at these proposals( they're probably recipients of welfare handouts
themselves ), but so what? We're not concerned with people like this.
	
	Sparta( an ancient Greek culture in rough proximity to Athens )was a
warrior society with a quite rigid code of ethics. What would be wrong with
'thinking' with our blood a little bit? Our culture has become too soft.

PREFACE
~~~~~~~

     Well, first of all, I am by no means an authority on this subject.  I am
just interested in it, and have decided to share with others what I have 
learned so far.  I am not going to list any sources because I simply can't
remember any.  I did not originally intend to write anything about this, but 
I figured that maybe someone else might find it interesting as well.  The 
information used in this article was not deliberately or specifically obtained 
from any particular sources.  It is a compilation my personal knowledge and
experience on the subject.  A long time ago, I heard that it was possible to
transmit data through the so called "airwaves".  This seemed very interesting
to me, so over time, I've learned about it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A huge amount of data is available throughout the radio frequency spectrum.
To access it, you need a radio receiver and a computer.  Just like we have
protocols, there are special protocols used on the airwaves.  Equipment, 
software, and instructions are all available from several sources including
ham radio groups.  However, there are other ways to go about setting up a 
"station".  I would recommend buying all of your needed equipment used.
     I have not intended this article for use by the absolute beginner in
radio data communications.  If you are interested in the equipment, the basic
instructions/techniques, or a general overview, then contact a local amateur
radio club.  They will be able to provide you with all of the information that
you require -- usually at no cost.
     First you will need a receiver.  It must at least cover 100kHz to 
30 MHz and have AM, USB, and LSB.  (USB=Upper Side Band, LSB=Lower Side Band)
The better the radio, the easier it will be to find and receive the data.
Now, you need an antenna.  Don't expect to use your old cheap CB whip.
I would recommend what is known as the "active dipole".  It is usually small
and has 2 lengths of wire that are tied parallel to the ground.  Of course 
you want this as high as possible and far away from the computer to ensure
good reception and little interference.
     Next comes a computer.  Just about anything will do.  Even an old VIC-20
would do the job, but more software is available for PC's.  Now you need an
interface or a radio modem.  There is a huge variety of these, but you need
one that fits the industry standards...the best idea here would be to contact
a dealer.  You can probably find a good model for a relatively inexpensive
price.
     OK, I'm not going to go into the special protocols here.  You can find
this information very easily in instruction manuals and books.  What you want
are some frequencies!  Before you try listening in, don't be surprised if you
see silly messages or meaningless characters.  They are used just to sort of
reserve a frequency.  An example would be: RYRYRYRYRYRYRYRYR... on and on
until the station was sending something for real.

Here are a few where you are likely to find others talking (RTTY (Radio 
TeleTYpe)):

3950, 14090, 21090, 28090 ...or 
at VHF/UHF frequencies: 144.6, 145.3, 432.6, 433.3

These are some where you may be able to find news agency transmissions (kHz):

3155-3400      3500-3900      3950-4063      4438-4650      4750-4995 
5005-5480      5730-5950      6765-7000      7300-8195      9040-9500
9900-9995      10100-11175    11400-11650    12050-12330    13360-13600
13800-14000    14350-14990    15600-16360    17410-17550    18030-18068
18168-18780    18900-19680    19800-19990    20010-21000    21850-21870
22855-23200    23350-24890    25010-25070    25210-25550    26175-28000
29700-30005

Now you can know the news before it is broadcast, or sometimes, as it is
happening.  These are fun to listen to, but even more fun to broadcast to.
Use your imagination...

Well, one more thing that I wanted to cover (because it is so interesting), is
satellites.  I don't know very much about this, but I do know that you will
need a scanner type of radio or a crystal controlled one.  Some scanners have
certain frequencies that are blocked out or don't work.  These frequencies 
usually carry things like military information.  With a little electronics 
knowledge, you will be able to easily fix these spaces as these are the really
interesting freqs.  You need a different antenna too.  One of the ones
that is sort of like a big horizontal "X" will work fine.

The general layout of the radio spectrum for satellites is as follows:
	  Amateur & Educational satellites:
		    144-146 MHz
		    430-440 MHz
	  Weather satellites:
		    136-138 MHz
	  Navigation satellites:
		    159-151 MHz

I heard that there are some that operate in the 1500+ MHz range, but I can't 
seem to figure out how to scan this high a frequency.  The VHF/UHF scanner
I was using couldn't go this high.  I suspect that this may be where the
"spy" and military satellites operate.  However, I also would assume that any
important data would be heavily encrypted.

A word of warning:  

     I am not sure about any laws regarding this subject, but I would be
careful.  It's easy enough to alter other peoples data and re-broadcast it
with changes, but I would assume that this is illegal.  It is extremely easy
to receive a satellite weather image, and it is also very simple to change it
and then send it out again.  It might be fun to make there appear to be a 
hurricane approaching on the 6pm news, but they must have ways of tracking
you down.  So, once again, be careful.  There are vast amounts of data riding
the airwaves, and it is available for all to view, with the right equipment.

		 The Invisible Answering Machine User Guide
			       by Lazarus Long

[EDITORS NOTE: The Invisible Answering machine is essentially a VMB service]
[              offered by MTS (Manitoba Telephone System). If it is        ]
[              implemented on your line, after approximately 3 rings, the  ]
[              caller is transferred to the VMB.                            ]

	Call answer is a service that acts like an invisible answering machine.
It will answer your calls when you are away from home or too busy to answer a
call.  By following this guide and listening to the system's friendly and
simple prompts, Call Answer is easy to use.

     The system will ask you to use symbols on your touch tone phone such as:
STAR *, and POUND #.  You'll find a quick reference card on the inside back
cover.  Remove this card and keep it near your phone to help you use the
system.

     Initial start up: Dial the Call Answer access number for Residential
customers - 783-CALL (2255). Voice prompts will then ask you to complete the
following steps:

1. Enter your temporary password - your telephone number will act as the
   temporary password until you create a new one.

2. The system will prompt you to change your temporary password to your own
   personal password.  Your personal password must be between 6 and 15 digits
   and cannot begin with 0 (zero).  For security reasons, CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD
   TO ONE THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO REMEMBER BUT HARD FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO GUESS.

     The system will prompt you to record your name and select a greeting: 
press 1 for standard greeting, or 2 for personal greeting.  Then press 1 1,
to review them.

     Listening to your messages from your telephone: From a touch tone phone,
dial the Call Answer access number 783-CALL.  Enter your password (if calling
from another phone you will have to enter your phone number first) and press:

			  1 1 to listen to new messages
			  1   to listen to all messages

After you have listened to your messages you can press:
			  
			  4   to replay message
			  7   to erase the message
			  9   to save the message

     Listening to messages from another mailbox: dial the Call Answer access
number, press *, then enter your mailbox number. Enter your password. 

NOTE: Long Distance charges will apply if you are calling from
outside your local calling area.

     Personal options: (press 4 from main menu) A number of Call Answer 
options can be personalized.  From the Personal Options you may press:

			  1   Message waiting - this is the inter-
			      mittent dial tone you hear when there
			      is a message waiting.  It can be 
			      turned on, or off.
			  2   Administrative options - allows you
			      to change your password.
			  3   Greetings - allows you to change your
			      greeting or recorded name as often as
			      you like.
     
     Enhanced Call Answer Features: (available for and additional low monthly
rate).  Message Notification (Outcall), can be programmed to call out to a
pager, cellular telephone or alternative telephone to inform you that a 
message has been received in your mail box. Press:

			  4   for Personal Options
			  4   for notification schedule
			  1   for first schedule (use this schedule
			      for display pagers)
			  2   for second schedule
			  3   for temporary schedule

	You will now be guided through a series of prompts which will assist
you in creating or modifying your message notification schedule.  After you
have completed your schedules and are back in Personal Options, Press * to
exit.
	Family/Extension mail boxes: Call Answer Family/Extension mail box
allows members of your family to receive messages separately with their own
personal password.  This service allows for one host and three extensions
mail boxes.  Each represents one individual within your household.  Extensions
can be added or deleted as required by the host.  To set up a Family/Extension
mail box press:
			  
			  4   for Personal Options
			  9   for Extension mail box

Enter the number for the extension you want to add or delete.  Call Answer
will automatically assign a password.  If you wish, you may change the
password.  Remember, it must consist of 6 to 15 digits, and must not start
with 0 (zero).  Then record your name. To find out who a message is for press
0.  Call Answer will tell you the number of new and saved messages in each mail
box. To send a message to another extension: listen to the entire message
then press:
			  
			  6   for forward message, and record your
			      comments.
			  #   then enter the extension number of
			      the person to whom you wish to send
			      the messages.
			  #   your message will be sent.
			  *   to exit.

For more information please call: 941-7061 in Winnipeg or visit your local
MTS Phone Center.

Comments: For those of you wondering, you don't have to call the owners number
to get at the VMB.  You can call the service and do whatever you have planned.
However, this doesn't look very useful to be hacking into, but I really know
very little about the actual hacking.  Perhaps the weakness is in finding a box
before someone has changed their password.  Still, they will eventually get
MTS to do something about it OR cancel the service.  The other weakness might
be in finding someone with the extension service and creating a new box, BUT
I am pretty sure that the owner knows about the extensions even if he can't
get to them (because of your password), so again he will get MTS to do
something about it. Even though the hacking potential is slim you might want
to fuck around with the system, change messages etc., but that of course is
just mischievous.  If you found one with Outcall I wonder if you could somehow
use that to your advantage.  If not you could surely cause havoc with someone's
beeper/cellular (ie. schedule it to call him/her at 2:00 am and whatnot), but
again that is just mischief. Also, when calling you only have two tries at
getting a number with the service.  On the third try it says "sorry you are
having problems, an operator will be with you in a moment".  At this point
pressing * to exit has no effect.  Hang up.  I don't know how many tries you
get at guessing passwords.  I have entered two and then used my proper one.
One more thing, if you do somehow get an extension box you will want to
disable the intermittent dial tone function on the main box.  This will just
delay them from discovering you though.  The thing about this system is that
people pay a monthly rate for it so you aren't likely to find any "unused"
boxes.

I'd be interested to hear from anyone about any "experiments" with this
system.

LAZ.

			       Catalog Reviews
			       by Lazarus Long

	
	If you are interested in "unique and unusual books" you will want to
read this.  In the last month I've been looking around for catalogs from
"underground" publishers and sent away a dozen or so catalog requests.
Unfortunately the responses have been slimmer than I hoped.  The following is
a review of those publishers who have sent me catalogs.

	Paladin Press is one of the better known publishers of "taboo titles".
In the note I received with my catalog they claim to have been in operation
for 22 years, so they aren't likely to be closing up shop anytime soon.  The
catalog is free to anyone that requests it, and is sent every two months to
customers who have made orders in the past year.  The most recent issue is
52 pages long.

	Being a student of espionage, intelligence, and terrorism, this is my
personal favorite of the catalogs I've received.  The variety of books they
offer in the 52 pages is quite extensive and survival oriented.  Ordering is
very easy via a 24 hour, 7 days a week, 1-800 number, or through the mail.

	Paladin Press sub headings include: Revenge & Humor, Locksmithing,
Weapons, New ID & Personal Freedom, Knives & Knife Fighting, Survival,
Sniping, Special Forces, Espionage & Investigation, Self-Defense, Explosives
& Demolitions, Military Science, Action Careers, Police Science, Terrorism,
Martial Arts, and Silencers.

	Service is pretty decent. It took less than three weeks from the day
I mailed my request to the day I received the catalog. Ordering by phone is
however a pain.  It is so low tech that the operator has to write down your
order by hand (while looking the books up in a stock catalog).  Shipping is
only supposed to take 7 to 10 days and they charge %6.00 or 5% of your order
(whichever is greater) for S&H.  If you want, other shipping arrangements can
be made.  They also accept Visa and Mastercard.

     The address is: Paladin Press, PO Box 1307,
		     Boulder, Colorado, 80306
     
     Their two 24 hour, 7 days/week 1-800#s are:
		     1-800-392-2400 (USA only)
		     1-800-872-4993 (USA and Canada)

	The Loompanics Unlimited catalog is clearly the largest and most
diverse catalog I've received to date.  The drawback is that it costs $5.00
US before you even get to see it.  They do, however, claim to be "the best
book catalog in the World".  It is indeed for anyone interested in "the
strange, the useful, the arcane, the oddball, the unusual, the unique, and
the diabolical". 

	The 1993 main catalog is over 280 pages long and its sub headings
are: The Underground Economy, Tax Evasion, Money Making Opportunities, Privacy
& Hiding things, Fake ID, Big Brother is Watching You, Conducting 
Investigations, Crime and Police Science, Locks and Locksmithing, Self
Defense, Revenge, Guns, Weapons, Torture, Survival, Self-Sufficiency, Head
for the Hills, Gimme Shelter, Health and Life Extension, Paralegal Skills,
Sex, Drugs, Rock 'N Roll, Intelligence Increase, Science and Technology,
Heresy/Weird Ideas, Anarchism and Egoism, Work, Mass Media, Censorship, Reality
Creation, and Self Publishing.

	I've only had this for a short time and haven't been able to get 
through it all, but it seems quite cool.  It also contains six articles which
consist of essays, short fiction, and a three page comic.  Some of the books
offered are the same as those in the Paladin Press catalog, but I have noticed
no price differences.

	Service is not as good as Paladin Press from what I can see. The
catalog took about a week longer to arrive and the orders can only be made by
mail.  Outside US orders have a whopping 12% of order PLUS $6.00 charged for
shipping and handling.  US orders are $7.50 plus regular shipping prices.

     The address is: Loompanics Unlimited, PO Box 1197,
		     Port Townsend, WA, 98368
     Their orders are shipped within 24 hours of receipt of payment.

	Books-by-phone is another cool publisher of controversial and 
underground books.  It says it costs two bucks but they'll send it free if
you give their 1-800# a call.  They basically bring together books from many
different publishers and make them conveniently available.  Prices seem to be
the same but I noticed one book that was actually $2.00 cheaper than that of
the original publisher.

	The Fall 1992 catalog is 32 pages long, and the subheadings are: 60s
and Beats, Black Markets, Comics, Criminology, Cyberpunk, Drug - Legal &
Social, Drug Literature, Ecology, Gardening and Herbs, Health, identification,
Timothy Leary, John Lilly, LSD, Marijuana, Money, Mushrooms, Occult,
Pharmaceuticals, Privacy, Psychoactives, Recovery, Rock & Roll, Sex &
Sensuality, Shamanism, Survival, Underground Labs, Weird & Exotic, Colin
Wilson, and Robert Anton Wilson.

	As for service, well, call the 1-800# and you get the catalog quite
quickly.  You can mail in orders or phone them in but there is a $3.00 charge
for a credit check on all credit card orders. American orders get a 10%
discount when made with money orders. Shipping and handling is $1.00 per book
in the US, and $3.00 per book in Canada.

     The address is: Books by Phone, PO Box 522,
		     Berkeley CA, 94701
     
     Their 1-800 is: 1-800-858-2665

	The Eden Press book catalog is aimed mainly at the subjects of
privacy and money.  Their goal is to "present ideas which can increase
opportunities for personal freedom".  There are some interesting books,
many of which I haven't seen in any of the other catalogs.  One thing that
endeared them to me was a notice on the cover, "Freedom is not dangerous to
your health".  So I guess you should read this magazine in large doses.

	The most recent catalog has the sub headings: Jobs, Credit, Privacy,
Protection, Business Ideas, Offshore Finance, and Personal Independence.

	Service looks very good.  It was roughly a week from the time I sent
the request to when I received the catalog.  You can order by mail, a 1-800
number, or by FAX.  They accept both Visa and Mastercard.  S & H in the US
seems reasonable (you can select the type of mail service you prefer), but
it is rather expensive in Canada at 20% of your order.

     The address is: Eden Press, 11623 Slater "E"
		     PO Box 8410, Fountain Valley
		     CA, 92728
     
     Their 24 hour, 7 days/week 1-800# is:
		     1-800-338-8484 (might be US only)
     
     Their FAX # is: 714-556-0721

	The last catalog I received was the Spring 1993 Butokukai (what a 
name!) book catalog.  It is only 23 pages long but has some stuff not
available in the other catalogs, but most of it is available elsewhere.  One
drawback is that they have changed their name sometime in the last two years
which I consider a sign of instability (they were formerly known as Desert
Publications). They are weapon oriented (and do sell some weapons, but they
cannot be shipped to Canada).

	The sub headings include: Under Cover Operations, Full Auto, 
Suppressors, Improvised Munitions, Weapons + Firearms, Guerilla Warfare, Army
Technical Manuals, SWAT Magazine back issues (sole suppliers), Self-Defense,
Home Study Courses (Ninja), Ninja, Firepower Magazine back issues, and
Locksmithing.

	Service is, all things considered, average.  It took a long time for
me to get the catalog (about 5 weeks) but that might have had something to do
with their name/address change.  You can order by mail, 1-800#, or FAX, and
they accept Visa and Mastercard.  An added bonus is that any order greater
than $50.00 gets you a free book of your choice (from a list of 13 books).
Shipping and  Handling is $4.00 per order in the US and $6.00 in Canada.

     Their address is: Butokukai, PO Box 430,
		       Cornville AZ, 86325
     
     Their 24 hour, 7 days/week 1-800# is:
		       1-800-747-6280
     
     Their FAX # is  : 602-634-1203

	I also just read the address for Barricade Books on a net.  I can
neither verify it or judge its quality but I'll include it for your
convenience.
     
     Their address is: Barricade Books, PO Box 1401-J
		       Secaucus NJ, 07096

Amendment: Butokukai may not have used the name Desert Publications, I may 
have been given some wrong information.  The real address for the REAL Desert 
Publications is: Desert Publications, PO Box 1751, El Dorado, AR 71731 USA.
You can also call: 1-501-862-2077.  Their catalog is $2.00 or free with an 
order.

				  Mild Anarchy

	Fed up with impersonal corporations?  Want to get even without
breaking the law?  There are several methods of mild anarchy that will cost
the corporations money and in some cases benefit you.

1)  Get a credit card and use it responsibly.  How is that anarchy some people
    will ask.  Well some credit cards have no service fees or monthly fees
    but charge a preposterous amount of interest on an outstanding balance.
    The anarchist though will never have an outstanding balance, and thus
    defers payment for a month and can collect interest from the money that
    instead remains in the bank. You also build up a healthy credit rating
    for your future.  Bank of Montreal Mastercards work well with this.

2)  Are you in a book or music club like Columbia House? Frustrated or pissed
    off at having to send back things saying you don't want the "selection
    of the month"?  The anarchistic solution is simple: don't send them back.
    Then when they send you the tape, CD, book, or whatever, you can listen
    to it (tape it if you want), read it, or whatever you do with the object.
    Then put it back in its original package, seal it up, and write REFUSED on
    the front of the package.  This way you get to sample and or copy the
    product for free, and the corporation pays the postage.  I'm in a book club
    and a CD club and this works fine all the time.  It is also handy if you
    don't want to keep receiving garbage from them all the time. If you haven't
    sent something back to them they figure you own them money and don't send
    anything until you have paid up.  Keep the "gift" for several months, have
    a good laugh at the form letters they keep sending (You are such a good
    customer, please pay up or we will be forced to sick Guido the collection
    agent on you), then send it back.

3)  Free stuff!  This is a good idea even if you don't want to annoy the
    company.  Most businesses really want to maintain good public relations,
    and a wily letter writer can frequently take advantage of this.  The result
    is often free stuff, delivered to your door.  An example: write a letter
    to a computer disk manufacturer and tell them you bought a box of disks
    but it didn't come with any labels.  They will probably send you a bunch
    of labels and an apology.  Labels are no big deal but this one has worked
    several times in the past.  Tips: 1) be creative with your complaint, but
    never be belligerent, 2) never write the same place twice with the same
    address, 3) don't expect too much...major complaints are dealt with by
    service centers, not through the mail.

4)  Not quite shoplifting is also good for laughs, especially in stores where
    the "undercover" guys are obvious.  Wear a baggy coat or whatever into
    the store, find the "undercover" guy and start acting suspicious, put
    stuff into your pockets, use your shifty eyes to maximum effect.  The
    idea now is to walk around the store a lot, maybe do some real shopping.
    It's very important that you don't start laughing whenever you see the
    "undercover" guy slinking around behind you.  Once you are ready to leave
    and feel you've tied up the store's crime fighting resources long enough
    you go to a counter near the check out.  Here you leave everything you
    don't wish to purchase and then go through the check out or leave.  This
    also serves as a vital service to keeping students employed as the store
    must now pay a stock boy to put everything back in place. Ha, a double
    whammy.  This works because store security cannot stop anyone until they
    have left the store with unpaid for goods.  If you wish to cause more
    havoc this can be done with a partner.  One person fake shoplifts and
    gets the security to follow him while the other partner REALLY lifts
    whatever he can.  This of course is breaking the law and is a "no-no".
    In Winnipeg, a while back, a group of people were suspected of doing
    this but were never caught. Apparently a dozen or so fake lifters would
    work with on or two real lifters.  It is rumored that they made off with
    a LOT of loot. Remember though, the cost of shoplifting is most likely
    passed on to other consumers.

Next issue I hope to bring you something more technical in the realm of
destruction.  I hope the above was entertaining, if not informative.

			How to Steal a Library Book
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Flip open only the cover of the book you want and make a clean cut along 
   the inside spine.  If you do this properly then you'll be able to see the 
   security strip.  It will be located inside the cover on the inner spine 
   of the book. It is best to use a really sharp knife like an surgical knife.

2. When you locate it then remove the security strip.

3. Now the book is yours.


Excuses
~~~~~~~                

	Here is a hint. If you want to steal a book it is advisable that you 
have also some signed out books with you.  So if by any chance you get caught 
by the alarm due to you're own human errors you will have an excuse.

	"Ahh... I guess the lady forgot to undecenticize this one,  I was 
carrying alot of books as you can see..." 

	"Oppss... Sorry, boy is this embarrassing. I guess I forgot to sign 
this one out...I was in a real big rush...sorry about the inconvenience.."

	Well you get the idea.  Just BS your way through.       


Having fun at the library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	Get yourself some security strips off some lame shitty books.  Put 
them in peoples purses, bags, jackets etc.  Or if you're really brave put 
one in the library's security guard or in your teachers coffee. The ideas are 
almost countless.  The best part of it all is that no matter how hard they 
try they will almost never find it.

	I Hope you enjoyed this file.  Remember that the phun never ends, it 
just finds a new victim...

			     Defeating Knogos
			     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Have you ever been caught shoplifting?  Did you feel embarrassed 
about the ordeal?  Well come get your chance to gain your rep back. There is 
a minor flaw in the system that virtually lets you walk straight out the 
door without setting off the alarm.

	Well first of all I have only experimented with what some retail 
stores call KNOGOS or simply security tags.  They are either a disk or a 
rectangular security tag.  If the store is using the new technological 
security strips(like ones in music stores) then just peel of the strip and 
it's yours.


The method to surpass the KNOGOS alarm system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	This is a pretty simple technique but takes a bit of good hand and 
eye coordination.

1.  First of all you should be in a normal standing position.  Next place 
    the KNOGO facing upward in the palm of your hand.  The procedure must 
    be performed out of the detection area.  The detection area is the area 
    between the two detection devices standing at each end of the entrance.
	
2.  Adjust the angle of your palm until the KNOGO is parallel to the ground. 
    VERY IMPORTANT! It means that the widest area of KNOGO must be parallel 
    to ground.  If the position of the KNOGO is bent at an angle at more 
    than an about an inch in the detection area the alarm will go off.

3.  After you are sure it is almost parallel to the ground.  Just walk out 
    the store.  Passing the detection devices.  Another CAUTION the knogo 
    must not ever come with in 1 foot and a half to the detection devices.  
    As this will trigger off the alarm.

4.  Cover your ass if anything goes wrong with your hand and eye
    coordination (being drunk).  Always be ready to make a fast exit out the
    door if the alarm goes off.

	Well that's all there is to it, pretty simple.  Hope you enjoyed 
this article.  See y'all later!  and remember "That knowing is half the 
battle".
