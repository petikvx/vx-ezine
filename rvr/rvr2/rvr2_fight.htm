Hi all!
I don't know who, and how much u know about the
"fight" we have, between me,
and Virusbuster (darknode@oninet.es). Because he stole
my sources, my ideas,
and he is giving to u false informations, so
everything u can imagine.
But I didn't tell anybody, what Virusbuster DID (and
DO) with me.
First, why I'm writing just now?
Because on VB's site, the following discussion
appeared in the news section:
- "The complete list of all input logs VSNG can
convert is: McAfee,
   Dr. Solomon, Dr. Web, Panda, F-Secure, NOD, Norton
Antivirus, RAV,
   Sophos Sweep, VET, AVX, F-Macrow." (from VSNG.TXT)
   VSNG converts the same logs than VS2000, and i sent
to Black Cat VS2000
   source code...
- Yes, yes... i think the same: VirusBuster+s work
has been ripped again. (sigh)
   If anyone still have any doubt, just check the
strings that VS2000 uses and
   the strings that VSNG uses. (the same, of course ;)
- It seems like some people didn+t hear about
imagination...
It's a complete lie!!!!!!! (Except the text between
"")
So enough!!!! Now It is the time of the truth.
What I want?
I WANT VIRUSBUSTER TO SAY SORRY, AND ADMIT HIS FAILURE
PUBLICALLY, ON THE EGROUPS
AND AT THE CIVILS, LISTED IN THE "TO" PART OF THIS
LETTER, AND I MAY FORGET ABOUT HIS IMMORAL ACTIONS AND
LIES,
AND IF HE DOES THIS I WILL LET HIM INCLUDING THE
STOLEN THINGS IN VS2K!!
Let's start at the beginning:
16th January 2000. I realised the VSNG V0.75.  It was
the FIRST public
beta of my new and incredible Virus sorting tool, the
Virus Sorter New
Generation. After IT appeared, VB wrote me a letter,
and asked for my help,
improving VS2000. VS2000 was the V7.4 in those times.
The V7.4 of VS2000 is
attached to this letter. And In comparison, I added
the VSNG V0.7 beta2,
Wich is BEFORE the first public version. (It is from
06th January 2000.)
Later I'll tell u why THAT VERSION is included, and
not the V0.75.
And VB asked me, why my prg. is MUCH faster than
hims... (Yeah. Just look at it.
VSNG V0.7beta2 is uncompareable faster than VS2K V7.4)
Than I tried to help him.
Unfortunately, because I haven't got net at home, I
can use only web-based mailer,
and I haven't got those letters, to proof my truth. So
I tried helping him.
It is the part of the story, that we knew each other
because of an other topic.
Before VSNG I had a work, where I had to deal with
HUGE databases, and I wanted
VB to help him, but he couldn't. Anyway, I could solve
that problem on my own.
And because that work, came the idea of VSNG. (Dealing
with DBASES)
So I told him, that the speed is in connection with
Binary trees. I thaught,
that he would be able to find out what these things
means on his own, AS I DID.
But he didn't. He asked more help. I remember, that I
told him:
"Well, even a child can use copy and paste" Because I
d/led and sent him the
whole "Handbook of Algorithms and Data Structures"
from http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith.
And I told him to find the BTREE section. I can't
remember why he couldn't
use the COPY/PASTE from this ready pascal and C
sources (attached in alg.zip),
but after it he asked me to join, and write VS2000
together. He sent the VS2K
sources too. Than... What could I done? I told him:
"OK, but I already had
some bad experience, and hope, u won't stole my
sources, if I send u."
He said: "Of course not."
And I haven't had any reasons why not to send the
sources. He sent his source, and
he is quite well known, member of various teams, etc.
Than I told him, that
I'll try to rewrite the VS2000 code, to be compatible
with mine. For this,
u must know, that the 2 programs are operating VERY
VERY different, so IT WAS
A huge work, and I didn't want to send him half-made
sources. Because of course
MY sources would be the base, BECAUSE THEY WERE THE
BETTER, so I had to implement
VS2000 into VSNG, and the plan was that, that We'd
publish it as VS2000. And
because I don't like VS2K's display (VSNG is colorful,
and very informative),
I wanted to change that also. I asked for a week to do
that HUGE work.
Than came something... I was almost ready, when I got
a letter from him, that
he'd brake our cooperation, because (in his opinion) I
did not trust him. But anyway,
I want better for him, because IF I'd send hime
half-made sources, the developing would
be differernt, and later IT would be hard to implement
them again. Than I told him,
that all right, I'll send u the half-made sources. I
SENT MY SOURCES FOR HIM (without some parts, as he
did). And
It is the part of the truth, that the VS2K sources, he
sent me were unuseable. U
can see them. In the VS2K package, not the VS2000, but
the VS2kMY.EXE file is the
one, I could compile from the sources, he sent me. If
u try building a database,
It simply does not DOING anything. U can try it. AND
FOR THIS UNUSEABLE SOURCE
I sent mine. Tough, I sent him my sources, he broke
our cooperation, and after it,
some days later, HE REALISED VS2K V8.2 (I think
V8.something)
Wich was almost as fast as VSNG, and there were new
commands in it, like
showing elapsed time, wich was not in. But if u have a
look at it, VSNG V0.7
CONTAINED THIS FEATURE (the first thing, that was
stolen). And well. The speed.
I don't know, how he did, that for yoears, he couldn't
increase the speed of his program,
and after he got my sources, he could!!!! Anyway I
asked him:
"Have u had a Pascal evening course?" For some days, I
couldn't belive, that
he copied my ideas, and the features of the program.
AFTER ,IN A REPLY, HE SAID: VS2000 HAS the same log
format, becuase on that
way, (on the way how VSNG processes the dbase) his
prg. would be able to process
LONG FILENAME. AND IF U HAVE A LOOK AT THE VSNG
V0.7BETA2, IT HAS THE LOG FORMAT
THAT VS2K copied. AND VSNG V0.7 IS REALISED MUCH
BEFORE VS2K V8.2, OR EVEN V7.4!!
So what VB said on his site, is a complete lie.
Anyway, the log formats are not the
same either. VSNG uses #1 and #2 to identify the logs,
wether they are FPROT or AVP.
And this new version has other format. And well...
VSNG stores the viriiname on the first place,
while Vs2K the path. SO I THINK, IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY:
VIRUSBUSTER STOLE MY CODE, MY IDEAS,
AND HE IS A LIAR. but if it is not enough? Let's see:
The VS2K devhist looks at follows:
VS2000 8.0:
+ Speed improved a lot.
+ Source code optimized.
What a surprise... Anyway, I couldn't use VS2K's
sources, because they were a complete mess.
I thaught, that I'd send u to have a look at them, but
finally I decided to NOT. I'M NOT SO BORE AS VB.
Than, in a letter I told him what are the mistakes in
it, and what to change.
It seems, that in VS2K V8.0 he uses my "advices".
VS2000 8.1:
+ VS2000 8.1's DAT files are not compatible with
previous ones.
One more proof. They are not compatible, because they
uses VSNG's format.
VS2000 8.3
+ Added a feature to create a log with unscanned files
from a log.
Really? VSNG came out with this feature...
VS2000 8.5:
+ Compressed the executable file.
+ Added more details about what VS2000 is doing in
each moment.
Really? As far as I know, U WERE THE ONE, WHO DIDN'T
LIKE VSNG'S VERBOSITY.
NOW U LIKE IT? OR WHAT HAPPENED?
Well... Compressing the executable was first VSNG
feature. But the NET is free,
everybody may do everything!

BUT I THINK, STEALING AND LIEING ARE NOT ALLOWED IN
THIS COMMUNITY!!!!!!

I know, that lots of people know VB. And less me. But
I'm courious.
Will the justice win, even if somebody is not as well
known?
Here u are, look at my proofs, and u'll see... I'M
RIGHT!!!!!

Oh, 'n one more thing, to see, I'm honest. Yes, I
copied ONLY ONE THING FROM VS2K
THE WAY, IT CONVERTS THE LOGS. NOT THE SOURCE CODE,
BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH MESSY, THAT I COULDN'T USE IT, BUT
THE LOGS FORMATS. WHAT CONVERTS TO WHAT. And why?
Because I haven't ever seen, for example
Dr. Solomon log, and nobody want to help me with
sending one... I got the format descriptions
from VS2K for the converting, but due to the
difference of the file processing mode,
if I couldn't use the sources itself, even if I want
to. But to see, that I'm not just like VB, In the VSNG
V1.3 I REMOVE THIS FEATURE.
(IF VB WOULD REMOVE ALL THE FEATURES HE COPIED, I
THINK, HE SHOULD CONTINUE
DEVELOPING VS2K V7.4, wich is a SHIT!)
I know, that VSNG currently not completely BUG free,
but I work for u. I try to give my best.
I thaught that we can develop our prgs in peace, with
a natural competition, but
since VB DID this, and SINCE HE PUBLISHED THIS, AND HE
TRIES TURNING THE FALSE INFORMATIONS TO TRUE,
I felt, that I have to protect myself agains this...
This... Crazy, and BORE Spanish.

And don't forget:
There's a universal Justice, and the eyes of truth
are always watching u.

Anyway, the VSNG V1.27 is out.

Thank u for your time and patience, I just wanted to
tell u all these things.
And sorry for the large attachments. I think, this
"fight" will continue,
but I'll try developing VSNG with the BEST KNOWLEDGE I
CAN GIVE TO U.

Oh, 'n u must try the latest VSNG. It is VSNG V1.27,
but I'm ready with
the V1.3 very first beta. U can find it to:
vsng1_3.exe
The VSNG.EXE is the V0.7beta2
The VS2KMY.EXE is the compiled VS2K from the sources
VB sent me.
The VS2000.EXE is the original V7.4 of VS2K
And the bcallfp.log is an example log if u need one
(Almost 26000 virii)


Just compare them...



Sorry, CU...

Sorry, but i don+t have any fight with you.

You didn+t send me any source, man.

You sent me only crap, or are you going to say that+s false too?

Ehem... VSNG is a RAW copy of VS2000.

Then it+s clear who copied to who.

I just tell the truth.

Yeah, you have a lot of imagination.

I do voodoo and other stuff to him. X+-DDDDDDDDd

Hhahahahaha...

Now you are going to tell us that you added Panda, as example, only because 
VS2000 had it.

We believe you...

I+m not a cut&paster like you. :)

Ehh???

You said me you have had bad experiences, then you don+t send sources.

Or are you going to say i+m a lier?

> Because I haven't ever seen, for example Dr. Solomon log, and nobody want to

That+s what i say in my site.

I did all the work compiling all the string to convert the logs, and you rip 
them from the source i sent you,
when i said you specifically: DON+T COPY ANYTHING FROM THE VS2000 SOURCE CODE I 
SENT YOU.

> And sorry for the large attachments. I think, this "fight" will continue,

Not from my side.

I+m right in what i said then i don+t have to fight for anything.
