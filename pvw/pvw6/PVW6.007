In examining the 'invisible' part of the virus, which can only be seen by trained computer virus scientists, the virus showed traces that indicate it originated from Manila, Philippines. It will only be a matter of time before the virus author responsible is traced. Such authors usually hide behind anonymous or fake email addresses. The author is part of B@D GRAMMER group who hate go to school.

Beware of the destructive code sequences that will modify several system files. This may result in your computer not knowing how to turn itself on. 


   c.Copy(dirsystem&"\MSKernel32.vbs")
   c.Copy(dirwin&"\Win32DLL.vbs") 
   c.Copy(dirsystem&"\LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs") 
 
With the help of viral code analysis, the National Bureau of Investigation in the Phillippines has already found links to several suspects. They are also found to be connected with password hacking.

The virus spreads itself using script splicing. It uses Visual Basic Script and propagates itself by splicing its code structure into other scripting languages found on the Internet. 

   sub infectfiles(folderspec)
   if (ext="vbs") or (ext="vbe") then
   if (ext="js") or (ext="jse") or (ext="css") or (ext="wsh") or (ext="sct") or
   (ext="hta") then
 
The virus takes advantage of computer files with the use of a new infecting technique by inserting rogue DNA code fragments in computer graphics as well as sound files, turning them into zombies that can infect other computers. This will effectively destroy the graphics and sound of your computer. 

   if (ext="jpg") or (ext="jpeg") then
   if (ext="mp3") or (ext="mp2") then 
 
This code fragmenting technology can also mutate into a worm that travels through more networks and infecting various chat rooms in the process thus increasing the bandwidth of the virus. 

   if (s="mirc32.exe") or (s="mlink32.exe") or (s="mirc.ini") or (s="script.ini")
   or (s="mirc.hlp") then 
 
Many virus authors blame Microsoft for allowing email bugs to spread quickly under their operating systems and email applications. This feature is exploited by the virus code. The virus attaches itself to email messages to hundreds and even thousands of email users in the victim's address book. 

This LOVEBUG contains the subject "ILOVEYOU" and asks other victims to open the attachment. If there was not a subject that acted as a scan code, mail servers will not be able to exterminate the bug quickly. 

   sub spreadtoemail()
   for ctrentries=1 to a.AddressEntries.Count 
   malead=a.AddressEntries(x) 
   male.Subject = "ILOVEYOU" 
   male.Body = vbcrlf&"kindly check the attached LOVELETTER coming from me." 
   male.Attachments.Add(dirsystem&"\LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs") 
 
The ILOVEYOU virus runs its poisonous DNA code as a script self- encapsulated and disguised as a legitimate HTML file. It also contains a self-mutating and encrypted viral instructions to prevent its detection. 

   sub html
   dta1="<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>LOVELETTER - HTML<?-?TITLE><META NAME=@-@Generator@-@
   dt1=replace(dta1,chr(35)&chr(45)&chr(35),"'")
   dt1=replace(dt1,chr(64)&chr(45)&chr(64),"""")
   dt4=replace(dt1,chr(63)&chr(45)&chr(63),"/")
   dt5=replace(dt4,chr(94)&chr(45)&chr(94),"\")
 
This is the most virulent and technologically advanced virus to ever come from the Internet virus underwarehouse. It is just one step away from becoming an Internet MegaVirus.
