Editorial 

Greetings! 

Thank you for taking time to download and read PVW issue #6. As you all well know it took a lot of time in making the zine because of "real-life" occurances, so PVW#6 was temporarily on hold. But now here it is! 

I never thought I'd release another issue of PVW, since I wasn't coding anymore. After issue 5 I said to myself it's time to retire and leave the vxscene to the new players, since all my virii are mostly DOS based and certainly times and OSes are changing. But due to insistent requests of people who want to show off their talent I've decided to release my final issue, issue #6. This zine is mainly a compilation of various works of people who posts in PVW boardroom and PVW mailing lists. They are the reason for the success and longitivity of PVW. These are your works, this is your zine. 

There are a lot of people I/we love to thank people weve met in the zine for the past years. I'll not mention your names anymore but you know you all influenced PVW in every little way you all can. I hope a lot of you out there will still continue coding and learning exploits, meet new faces, sharing knowledge and most importantly, to keep the infection alive...
