An Interview with MicroMagic by Putoksa Kawayan 


You might have known Microbe but did you know who its author is? Me? I never had any idea who wrote it. The author's name, his handle, had been on the payload all along. I only realized this when last December 25, 1998, I received an e-mail from MicroMagic commenting on the Microbe article in HEX-FILES No 1. He was surprised that Microbe was featured since it is an old and nearly extinct, if not already extinct, virus. 

Since I did not want to let the opportunity pass just like that, I asked MicroMagic if he is willing to be interviewed. Who can speak authoritatively on the virus than the author himself. Thankfully, MicroMagic agreed. Considering that Microbe was written more than 10 years ago, I did not expect MicroMagic to remember every detail. I would have wanted to clarify some points but due to his busy working schedule, I decided to just let it go. 

The interview was conducted by e-mail on the first half of January 1999. This article was based on two e-mails that were stitched together. The responses had undergone minor editing either at the request of MicroMagic or at my discretion with only the welfare of MicroMagic in mind. 

I hope that through this you would know Microbe and its author, MicroMagic, a bit more. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q. Are you a true-blue Cebuano? I mean, were you born and raised in Cebu or in another Cebuano speaking province?
A. Yes. I was born and raised in Cebu, near University of San Carlos. 

Q. Can you describe your standing in class during your elementary and high school days, generally? Were you an average student, or were you always on the honor list at the end of the school year?
A. I was just an average student during my elementary and high school days. I even remember in my elementary days when I showed my report card to my parents and I told them that I have good news. Last grading I had 2 red marks and now I got 3 red marks. he he he. 
My interest was more on electronics, its practical applications. I didn't bother to study my lessons because, at that time, I'm interested and curious about how radio, TV, etc. work. 

Q. Where did you go to college? In Cebu? What course did you take up? 
A. I finished my electrical engineering in University of San Carlos- Cebu. It took me about 8 years instead of 5 years. The reason was I had to work while studying since my parents can't afford to send me to college. 

Q. In general terms, what did you do after college and before moving to the US? Did you work in Cebu or Manila? 
A. I worked with Microchips Inc. as junior programmer, and, at the same time, taught pascal and assembly language programming during my college days. I had a very tight schedule. Usually, school in the morning, teach programming in the afternoon, and do application programs till midnight. I barely had 5 to 6 hours of sleep. Then I transferred to a garments factory as Senior Programmer doing the same application programs like GL, AR, AP, Inventory, payroll, etc. I was using turbo pascal at that time. After a year, the company closed due to labor disputes. I was lucky that after two months I got a contract with (name of company). Later on, I was hired as a regular employee doing programs for finance. 

Q. What made you move to the US? 
A. When I was with (name of company), they exposed me to large platforms, like IBM mainframes and Sun Microsystems' Unix. Later, they purchased a German software called SAP R/3. I was a member of the team that implemented SAP R/3 nationwide. I traveled from north to south, anywhere in the Philippines. In late 1996, I learned that there were many companies in the US that need SAP R/3 experts. So I browsed the Internet and started sending my resume. After three months, a US-based consulting company made an offer. I grabbed the opportunity without any hesitation. 

Q. In general terms, would you describe your work and/or career moves since moving to the US? 
A. I was expecting a tough and challenging job, but it was not. It is the same old crap that I was writing when I was in the Philippines that's why I felt really bored. Right now, I am developing a server program for Unix and NT based platforms for mobile bar code scanners. Hopefully, I can release it in the US market by end of the year. 

Q. Where did you learn to write computer programs? 
A. I learned it through self-study with my cousin who happened to have a TRS-80 color computer. He was the one who introduced me to Microchips Inc. 

Q. What made you decide to write a virus? 
A. Microbe was intended to advertise Microchips and, also, out of curiosity. It was my friend's idea that maybe we could advertise Microchips through a virus that displays something that complements Microchips. He got the idea and I have the technology. It blends. 

Q. When you wrote Microbe, was that when you were still in school or after? How old were you then? 
A. It was in 1985 when I wrote the first prototype. I was 19, third year college at that time. Later, it was my friend's idea to put the complementary message to Microchips. 

Q. Prior to writing Microbe, have you seen other virus codes? viruses? 
A. A visiting professor from US gave me a piece of virus code (don't know the strain) and later one of my close friends gave me a disk with "(c) Brain virus". Those two codes are somewhat similar in terms of technique. 

Q. Was Microbe patterned after another virus? Were you influenced by another virus? 
A. It's the strain from the visiting professor that had influenced me in writing the microbe virus. Later, I got some techniques from (c) Brain virus -- FAT checking. 

Q. You mentioned in your first e-mail that you used debug to write Microbe. How did you do the first generation of the virus? Was it written directly to disk sectors or did you create a dropper program? What version of DOS did you use? 
A. DOS 2.0 debug has the capability to write directly to disk sectors because I didn't have disk utilities like Norton at that time. 

Q. Is there a reason why you named your virus Microbe? Or was that really the name you gave your virus? 
A. The prototype doesn't have any name. When we put the message to version one, it was my friend who baptized it. 

Q. Was Microbe intentionally released in the wild? Why? 
A. Microbe, I would say has two versions. The first version was our prototype. It does not check the FAT for the last four sectors of your diskette. So, it will overwrite the last four sectors. Version 1 was not intentionally released since it lacked FAT checking. It was accidentally released when I was handling a class in Microchips. I accidentally booted up my Microbe prototype disk and some of my students copied my sample programs. After a week, I discovered that Microbe has gone wild. I didn't have the chance to stop it. Even some of my diskettes got infected with the Microbe. 
It was in the 2nd version that we put the FAT checking -- a well- behaved virus. We increased the counter in displaying the message "with a box shadow". It was this version that we intentionally released in the wild since I believe it's harmless. It is version 1 that creates the havoc. 

Q. Can you explain what you meant by FAT checking? 
A. I check the file allocation table to get disk free space, so that before I write the virus code into the disk, I have to make sure that those sectors didn't contain any data or programs. 

Q. What was your reaction when Microbe spread far and wide, and became the talk of the town? 
A. I was so surprised to learn that Microbe was in the wild and spreads really fast. It was a premature release. I really felt sorry for its destructive behavior. I was not even proud of it -- that I wrote the program. 

Q. Where there other people who knew you are coding virus programs? 
A. My best friend who gave me the idea for advertising Michochips and, later, all Microchips staff. 

Q. What were their reactions before and after release of the virus? 
A. It was after the accidental release of the virus that I got their reactions. I clearly explained to them the good intention. They appreciated what I did for the company. But the bad thing is that it is the prototype that creates the trouble and spreads rapidly. 

Q. Aside from the two strains of Microbe, did you write any other virus? 
A. No. 

Q. Looking back, has it ever occurred to you that you made a mistake in writing a virus? Any regrets or none at all? 
A. I can't change history. But if ever I can travel back in time, I'll just keep it to myself. I felt so sorry for those users who lost their data because of Microbe. 

Q. Let us say you are given a chance to relive your life and given the same situation as when you wrote Microbe, would you still write Microbe? Why? 
A. Yes. But I would rather keep it to myself. 

Q. Let us say you are going to write a virus now, what kind of virus would you write? What would you want it to do? 
A. No idea yet. Maybe explore some weakness in SMTP or WEB servers. 

Q. After being away from the virus scene for so long and now deeply involved in mainstream programming, how do you feel now about viruses? About virus coders? 
A. Right now, I consider a virus as a masterpiece of an individual. I can picture out his mind, doing long hours of research just to evade anti-virus. It's a fight of wits. And, users are the casualties. It's a war. It's business. Without viruses, you can't sell anti-virus programs. 

Q. What are your thoughts about destructive codes in viruses? Do you think this is an integral part of coding viruses, that if your virus does not create havoc, it is lame? 
A. Just like real viruses, it depends on your intentions. In short, it reflects the true nature and identity of an individual. 

Q. What advice would you like to give programmers, both viral and non- viral coders, especially Pinoys? Words of encouragement perhaps. 
A. I know that we "Pinoys" are very creative when it comes to programming and the Philippines is the second supplier of IT professionals in the world. Even in our programming team, 80 percent are Filipinos. And, we have the advantage in communications skills. Even here in the U.S., we surpass American and Indian programmers. My only advice is, exploit our skills both in programming and communication skills. In doing so, you are setting up your future, for you and for your family.
