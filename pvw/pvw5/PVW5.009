Win32.BO, aka Back Orifice Trojan

This trojan is an network administration utility itself that allows to
control remove computers on the network. "Back Orifice is a remote
administration system which allows a user to control a computer across a
tcpip connection using a simple console or gui application. On a local lan
or across the internet, BO gives its user more control of the remote
Windows machine than the person at the keyboard of the remote machine has"

The only feature makes this utility to be classified as malicious trojan
software - the silent installing and execution. When this program runs, it
installs itself into the system and then monitors it without any requests
or messages. If you already have it installed on the computer, you cannot
to find this application in task list. The trojan also does not manifest
its activity in any way.

The trojan is distributed in a package of several programs and
documentation. All programs in package were written in C++ and compiled by
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. The date stamp on EXE files that we got says
that all files in package were compiled at the end of July - first week of
August 1998. All the programs in package have Portable Executable formats
and can be run under Win32 only.

The main executable in package is the BOSERVE.EXE file that might be found
with different names on infected computer. This is the trojan itself. It is
the "server" part of the trojan that might be called by clients from remote
computer.

The second file is the BOCONFIG.EXE utility that can configure the server
as well as attach it to other executable files in the same style as viruses
do that. While attaching (infecting) the host file is moved down and the
trojan code is placed at the top of file. When "infected" files are run,
the trojan extracts the original file image and spawns it without any side
effects.

There are two "client" parts of the trojan (console and window), they
operate with "server" from remote computer. Two other executable files in
package are used by trojan while compressing/decompressing files on
"server".

When the trojan is executed on the computer, it first of all detects its
status: is it original trojan code or attached to some host file, i.e.
modified by the BOCONFIG.EXE utility. In this case the trojan locates
customized options in the host file and reads them.

The trojan then initializes the Windows sockets, creates the WINDLL.DLL
file in the Windows system directory (this file is stored as a resource in
the trojan), then gets several KERNEL32.DLL APIs addresses for future
needs, search for trojan process already run and terminates is (upgrades
the trojan process), copies itself to the Windows system directory and
registers this copy in the system registry as the auto-run service:

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

Creates a TCP/IP datagram socket, assigns a port number 31337 (by default)
to this socket and opens this port for listening. The trojan then runs
standard Windows DispatchMessage loop, i.e. stays in Windows memory as a
process with hidden attribute (it has no active window and is not visible
in task manager).

The main trojan routine then listens for commands from remote client. The
commands go in encrypted form and starts with the "*!*QWTY?" (without "
character) ID-string.

Depending on the command the trojan is able to perform a set of actions:

   * gets and sends computer name, user name and system info: processor
     type, memory size, Windows OS version, installed drives and free space
     on them,
   * shares selected drives
   * list disk contents or searches for specific file
   * sends/receives files (reads and writes them), as well as deleting,
     copying, renaming and running them (including updating itself)
   * created/deletes directories
   * compressed/decompresses files
   * logoffs current user
   * halts the computer
   * enumerates and sends active processes
   * enumerates and connects to network resources
   * terminates selected process
   * gets and sends cashed passwords (p/words that were used during current
     seance), then looks for ScreenSaver password (decrypts and sends them)
   * displays message boxes
   * access the system registry
   * opens and redirects other TCP/IP sockets
   * supports HTTP protocols and emulates Web-server, so one may access the
     trojan by Web browser
   * plays sound files
   * hooks, stores and sends keyboard input while the user is logging, see
     below:

While installing into the system the trojan creates the WINDLL.DLL file (it
keeps this file image in its resources). In case of need the trojan loads
this DLL into the memory and initializes it, the DLL then hooks keyboard
and console (device console) input and stores hooked data to the
BOFILEMAPPINGKEY and BOFILEMAPPINGCON files that are then available for
main trojan routine.

The trojan is also possible to expand its abilities by using plug-ins. They
can be send to the "server" and installed as trojan's plug-in. The features
and main functions (including possible malicious ones) are on its author
responsibility.
