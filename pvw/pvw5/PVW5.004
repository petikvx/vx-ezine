POST - Cold Boot / Power On Self Test Activities

	- power supply starts Clock Generator (8284) with Power
	  Good signal on BUS
	- CPU reset line is pulsed resetting CPU
	- DS, ES, and SS are cleared to zero

	Cold and Warm Boot both execute the following sequence
	- CS:IP are set to FFFF:0000 (address of ROM POST code)
	- jump to CS:IP  (execute POST, Power On Self test)
	- interrupts are disabled
	- CPU flags are set, read/write/read test of CPU registers
	- checksum test of ROM BIOS
	- Initialize DMA (verify/init 8237 timer, begin DMA RAM refresh)
	- save reset flag then read/write test the first 32K of memory
	- Initialize the Programmable Interrupt Controller (8259)
	  and set 8 major BIOS interrupt vectors (interrupts 10h-17h)
	- determine and set configuration information
initialize/test CRT controller & test video memory (unless 1234h
	  found in reset word)
	- test 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller
	- test Programmable Interrupt Timer (~8253~)
	- reset/enable keyboard, verify scan code (AAh), clear keyboard,
	  check for stuck keys, setup interrupt vector lookup table
	- hardware interrupt vectors are set
	- test for expansion box, test additional RAM
	- read/write memory above 32K (unless 1234h found in reset word)
	- addresses C800:0 through F400:0 are scanned in 2Kb blocks in
	  search of valid ROM.	If found, a far call to byte 3 of the ROM
	  is executed.
	- test ROM cassette BASIC (checksum test)
	- test for installed diskette drives & FDC recalibration & seek
	- test printer and RS-232 ports.  store printer port addresses
	  at 400h and RS-232 port addresses at 408h.  store printer
	  time-out values at 478h and Serial time-out values at 47Ch.
	- NMI interrupts are enabled
	- perform INT 19H (bootstrap loader), pass control to boot record
	  or cassette BASIC if no bootable disk found
	- WARM BOOT procedure is now executed


CPU Characteristics / Determination

	8088,80188,V20	six byte prefetch queue, allows use of self
			modifying code to determine length of prefetch

	8086,80186,V30	four byte prefetch queue, allows use of self
			modifying code to determine length of prefetch

	8088,8086,80188,81086,v20,v30	Flag register bits 12 through
			15 cannot be cleared

	8088,8086	will shift left or right using all 8 bits of
			CL, if CL = 33, register is guaranteed to be
			cleared

	80188,80186,80286,80386	will shift left or right using only
			lower 5 bits of CL.  If CL = 32, the shift will
			not occur

	80286,80386	earlier CPU's decremented SP before a PUSH SP, but
			286+ pushes the value first then, decrements SP

	8088,8086	non-zero multiplication result clears zero flag

	V20,V30		non-zero multiplication result does not clear
			zero flag, set ZF before multiply, and test after,
			if it's still set, then it's a V20, V30

	 80286		allows setting of bit 15 of the flags register

	 80386		allows setting of bits 12 through 14 of flags register


Detecting ANSI.SYS

	Compare segment address of a DOS interrupt with the segment of the
	standard CON device.  If equal, then ANSI is not loaded.  If the
	segment address of CON is greater than the DOS interrupt, then ANSI
	is loaded or a TSR is handling the interrupt.


Detecting DESQView

	1.  call INT 2F with AX = DE00h
	2.  if AL = FF on return DESQView is installed


Detecting Disk Ready

	1.  use INT 13H,4H (Verify Sector) to check ready for read
	2.  check for error in AH of:
	    80h  Time out, or Not Ready
	    AAh  Drive not ready
	    00h  drive is ready for reading
	    other value indicates drive is ready, but an error occurred
	3.  use INT 13H,2H (Read Sector) followed by INT 13H,3H (Write Sector)
	    to check ready for read/write.  First read sector, test for
	    ready;  write sector back, check for 03h (write protect) or
	    any of the other BIOS disk errors

	- multiple attempts should be made to allow for diskette motor startup
	- allows testing of drive ready by bypassing DOS and critical errors
	

Detecting Drive Existence

	1.  save current drive	(INT 21H,19H)
	2.  set current drive   (INT 21H,EH)
	3.  get current drive   (INT 21H,19H)
	4.  if current drive == drive requested
	       then drive exists
	       else drive doesn't exist
	5.  reset original drive  (INT 21H,EH)

	- no critical error is generated if invalid drive is selected


Detecting EGA Video

	INT 10h, function 12h (INT 10H,12H), subfunction 10h (in BL) will
	return BL = 10h if not an EGA since invalid functions requests
	return without register modification


Detecting VGA Video

	INT 10H,1AH can be used to detect the presence of VGA.
	BL = 7	VGA with analog monochrome display
	   = 8	VGA with analog color display

	- some enhanced EGA adapters will incorrectly identify as VGA
	  when INT 10H,1BH is used


Detecting Extended Keyboard BIOS

	1.  use INT 16H,5H to stuff FFFF into the keyboard buffer
	2.  use INT 16H,10H to read the keystrokes back
	3.  if the data stuffed into the keyboard is returned within 16
	    extended reads, the BIOS handles the extended keyboard
	4.  byte at 40:96 (BDA) is another method of detecting extended BIOS
	    but is not reliable since some compatibles give false positives

	
Detecting present of Expanded Memory Manager

	1.  attempt to open file/device 'EMMXXXX0' using INT 21H,3DH;
	    if successful continue, else no EMM
	2.  make sure EMMXXXX0 is a character device and not a disk file
	    by using IOCTL function 0 (Get Device Info);  bit 7 of DX
	    should be set for char device and clear for disk file
	3.  make sure Expanded Memory Manager is available using IOCTL
	    function 7 (Get Output Status);  AL should be non-zero (FF)
	    if Memory Manager is available, and zero if not available.
	4.  call INT 67H,46H  to get version information

	
Detecting Existence of Mouse Driver

	1.  check INT 33H vector is not 0:0
	2.  check INT 33H vector does not point to an IRET
	3.  call INT 33H,0H to reset the mouse and get installed state
	4.  call INT 33H,24H to check version, type and IRQ
