  Greetings to all virus writers/enthusiasts,

      We've just released PVW zine 5. It's my (LORZ) first time to release a zine. 
Zoom23 was very busy so he handed me the task of making the zine. I would personally
say that I'm not fit to do this job because I have no exeprience in editing zines
I explored many sites and seen the abundance of underground groups. I include
some news in this editorial to eliminate another page.
      My website at TRIPOD was deleted. Nevermind about that I have no more
plans of making my personal website. I haven't updated the site for months. I
was too lazy to update it.
      Many members have joined us. I hope that we could help each other by giving 
their own creations. I know that our members are talented ones. They've got the knowledge 
of programming a virus. Most of the members are foreigners so this group is not really
a solid Filipino group but an international group. It was struggle for Zoom23 building
this group but we've made it. The only member who would gradually help was Lord
Julus   Thanks for the help!!!
      Our friend Psk has always been there in helping us. Thanks a lot!
He has always been there supporting us. He would usually comment me and I would learn 
from my mistakes. Sorry at your website and your address. But I admire your new
website.
      When I came upon the new webpage of PsK, I found a new group call Hackerz Network.
When I was about to go to their website, their site was deleted. I hope they
can make their site so that I can know them much better.This shows that Philippine
VX is growing and I hope that we could give Philippines a name in the International VX.
      When I received an e-mail from Zoom23 and Lord Julus that the SourceOfKaos
was removed by the FBI. Maybe they can delete the webpages of virus authors but
they can never bring the group down. So be ready for this information mayhem.
      VDAT 1.7 has been released by Cicatrix. I want to download that mag but
couldn't because it's a big file and I just surf at our school.
      29A3 has been released by 29A. You can download it at www.sourceofkaos.com/homes/29a
I admire this group a lot. They have much knowledge on virus Win32,Polymorphism,
Stealth, etc...
      Codebreakers website was also temporarily offline because their host
LiquidWeb was being attacked. It was believed that the attacks were being done
by Fred Cohen. This sick child (Fred Cohen) is a disgraceful person.
      The hacker I usually know, Analyzer who hacks the Pentagon and NASA has
already been caught. I would usually find his name in newspapers. 
      The zine contains ASM source codes and tutorials.Everybody must be responsible
for his/her action.
