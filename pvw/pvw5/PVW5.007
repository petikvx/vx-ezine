Microsoft Excel Hole

        Microsoft Corp.'s Excel spreadsheet software has a vulnerability that
lets hackers run certain types of executables that can give them access to a
PC user's files. The hole is dubbed the "Rusian New Year" exploitation. The new
form of mobile code attack "clearly ilustrates the latent security threats on
the Internet and the importance of inspecting any code that is downloaded onto
your personal computer."
        The problem, along with a patch that plugged the vulnerability, was
posted on Microsoft's Web site Dec. 10.
        The hacker backdoor is a legitimate Excel function, dubbed CALL, that
allows executables to be run from a worksheet. But if that executable, delivered
via E-mail or from a Web site, is of a malicious nature, "a worksheet containing
this function could represent a security risk to customers," according to a
Microsoft security bulletin also dated Dec. 10.
        The seriousness of the new Russian New Year exploit is that it combines
two legitimate computer functions, CALL and HTML, to create a hole that affects
virtually anyone surfing the Internet. The Russian New Year exploit exposes tens
of millions of Internet users to potentially serious damage and requires little
programming skill to create. This combination that opens a major security hole
is the new story, not Microsoft's one portion of the combination.
        Office 97 and Excel  97 users should apply Microsoft's patch to disable
the CALL function. But Office 95 and Excel 95 do not appear to have a patch to
eliminate this CALL function nor do non-English language versions of Office 97
or Excel have a solution.
