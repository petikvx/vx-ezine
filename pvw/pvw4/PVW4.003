ฑ      confidential pieces of intellectual property in the world,"          ฑ
ฑ      Microsoft lawyer James Jardine.                                      ฑ
ฑ                                                                           ฑ
ฑ     Jardine said Microsoft will provide the code within 5 days. Caldera,  ฑ
ฑ     based in Orem, purchased Novell's DR-DOS operating program and        ฑ
ฑ     business in 1996. It claims that Microsoft,developer of the competing ฑ
ฑ     MS-DOS system, has made false claims about the compatibility of its   ฑ
ฑ     dominant Windows software w/ DR-DOS. It alleges Microsoft intentional-ฑ
ฑ     ly built "incompatibilities" into the system.                         ฑ
ฑ                                                                           ฑ
ฑ     The accusations parallel in some ways the federal government's anti-  ฑ
ฑ     trust lawsuit against Microsoft. Justice Department officials claim   ฑ
ฑ     the firm's alleged aggressive marketing strategies have hurt competi- ฑ
ฑ     tors.                                                                 ฑ
ฑ                                                                           ฑ
ฑ     Both DOS programs are operating systems, which enable personal compu- ฑ
ฑ     ters to execute basic commands. Windows is a software overlay that al-ฑ
ฑ     lows a user to "point-and-click" on visual images using a computer    ฑ
ฑ     mouse instead of typing commands.                                     ฑ
ฑ                                                                           ฑ
ฑ     Caldera also claims Microsoft used overly aggressive licensing        ฑ
ฑ     agreements, selling MS-DOS and Windows software to computer manufact- ฑ
ฑ     urers at unfair prices.                                               ฑ
ฑ                                                                           ฑ
