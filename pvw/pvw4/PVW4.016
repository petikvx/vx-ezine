  --> An episode to my geeky but colorful life of a 19 (20 by the time ya read
  this) year old net fanatic,meat loving, financially problematic, newly eye-
  glassed (ILLUSTRATION : B-) )virus writer. I don't know why I wrote this but
  I just couldn't help but release my subconciuos th@ (that) I only held within
  the boundaries of my diary (YES! I do keep one). I started since I was in
  sophomore in high school. (include daydreaming here...)
  --> The things I do baffled me every night. Computers are really ruling the
  world,and ppl like me will soon be replaced by more technical, vibrant virii
  coders whose generation would virtually never touch DOS again. That's another
  reason why I'm writing this to immortalize myself. Forgive me but I just
  can't help my ego. Besides I'm the editor,hell,I can do whatever I want ! B-)
  Flame alert!
  --> Today, like any other day i woke up about 11:30 AM. Everybody is having
  their lunch and I'm having my breakfast. I am not going to school right now.
  I was late for enrollment 'coz of the 3 month vacation in Norway this summer.
  I still have a month to waste before I enroll next sem this October. It didn't
  rain today which is unusual this time of the year here in Philippines and
  the smoke in the jeepneys killing me as well as everyone every day. As usual
  I am at this computer center where i always can be found where I usually
  spend my time coding programs and making virii. I am actually on a first name
  basis with the operator there and he always reserves a certain computer space
  there. Th@t's my fave spot, to sit and code. It's in the center so I can
  sense the ppl around me. I was working with my Issue#4 of my zine,and testing
  the TBKEYGEN.EXE that "Putok sa Kawayan" (PsK) e-mailed me. Damn I can't make
  the damn thing work!. help alert! I'll just email PsK for help.
  --> Working with a strain in my Cheska Virus but supercharging Pascal with
  assembly language is really tedious, one wrong code & the computer hangs.
  Damn machines.
  --> If I were to be labeled Like the Intel sign but with seven descriptions
  the list would be:

             ๘ Mouse Potato ( Internet version of Couch Potato )
             ๘ PASCAL RULES!
             ๘ Books,books,books, and more books.
             ๘ Cheska Garcia
             ๘ Sci-Fi Movies
             ๘ Late 70's & 80's Music , R&B
             ๘ Hopeless romantic but have no time for girls

  --> That is what it would be like as I can best describe myself today, but I
don't know tomorrow. I might mutate, like a virus. I support polymorphism. Well
I try to live my life every viral line of code a time. Like another episode of
"My so called life".
  --> Damn bugs. I'll probably write the schematics tomorrow. Besides I'm
sleepy.
Zoom23 Logs out and Crashed. Time : 11:20 PM.

 --> Got Online today. Checked my e-mails. Damn Polaris. The lamer on the
chatroom I was in. The guy hates virus writers,so I gave him a piece of my
mind. Unfortunateley he was an operator at that chatroom so guess what I got
kicked out. Well i should've seen that coming a mile away. Well at least I
told him a thing or two. Got mail from my cousin.
 --> Finishing my virus strain but it has still bugs.
 --> It rained heavily. Lucky I brought my jacket along.
 --> My subconcious speaks again...

  --> As if I was talking to my computer or myself. It doesnt matter.
   I write things I first think about,sunconsiously as I term it. The words
   we use r becoming shorter and shorter as we "nettify" every word.
   ( Insert geeky look while thinking here...)
   It looks like encrypted to me. BTW,IMHO...ASAP, ASL,haxors,
   AFK,0.K.,...:) :-0 ,@-->- ###hi###, me@topoftheworld, 404 error...

  --> I learned one thing today. No matter how computers dominate the world and
  our lives, we still need to be without it sometimes. Though it is very hard
  for most of us. " Computers is a part of our lives but having people to be
  with you when power shotages shuts computers down th@s what's important."
  As It was said to me.
  I am but melodarmatic...and it sucks. Musshy things die.

  I smell Blood. More like people flaming each other at chatrooms.At least
  less violent, less blood, more insult , more wrecked keyboards. I think
  I should learn Brazilian Jijutsu ,then again I might end up playing football.
