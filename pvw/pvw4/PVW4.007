        "The Giant Black Book of Computer Viruses" by Ludwig (American Eagle
Press,1995) argues "Should we not be a Socrates, who ... sought Truth and
Wisdom... the question that really matters is not how computers can make us
wealthy or give us power over others, but how they might make us wise.  What
can we learn about ourselves? about our world? and yes, maybe even about
God?  Might we not understand life a little better if we can create
something similar, and study it, and try to understand it?"
     Some researchers seek to figure out new ways to defeat antivirus programs
because they believe it is the best way to design them to stay one jump
ahead of the tiny minority of virus writers who release damaging code.  Do
you really want to rely on a commercial antivirus program to be your only
defense?  Yes, these programs can be really helpful.  However, if you are a
serious hacker who downloads and tests lots of Windows programs (almost all
viruses attack Windows), you had better be prepared to fight viruses that
the antivirus companies have never even heard of.
      Other people research viruses because they could become potent weapons in
time of war.  The story of a computer virus being unleashed against Iraq
during the Desert Storm War is a April Fool's Day hoax that got out of hand.
But the day is coming when they will be used in wartime.
        If you live in a country where the government is run by a dictatorship or
is occupied by an invader's troops, viruses may be the guerrilla warrior's
best friend.
        Some virus designers want to create artificial life forms that will, for
good or evil, revolutionize history.
