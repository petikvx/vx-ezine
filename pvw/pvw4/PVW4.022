INTRODUCTION :
--------------
            There are numerous ways wher AV's can capture disassemble
viruses and even watch how they behave. One of these ways is using a
dummy file,a goat. A virus goat.

What are virus Goats?
            There are little programs that enable a user to create a fake
execultable file and can specify that certain file's properties like the
attribute,file's date/time,file size and type of executable (i.e COM,EXE).
            When this produces, these virii goats now comes the testing of
a "raw" virii or a file infected by a certain virus. The virus of course will
infect the executable produced by the virii goat engine. Once infected the
user/AV can now examine the infectd dummy file's contents. Some dummy files
only contain the "MZ" marker for EXE and padded by a zero byte or an ascii
character like ALt-178 or anything until it reaches the proper lenght. By this
way the AV writer can now examine clearly the structureof the virus.
            Now there are also several ways to catch a virus and examine it,
but this I think is one of the common ways they do it.

FOOLING VIRII
-------------
           A simple approach in fooling virii that seraches for EXE files on a
computer is by renaming their extension (ie .PVW for .EXE) and then make a
batch file that renames them to their original form then loads them to
execute,then renames them back to the cloaked form.

:START
   REM Copyright Zoom23 for PVW #4
   REM brianjan@mailcity.com
@ECHO OFF
   REM Rename file in parameter
ren %1.PVW %1.EXE
   REM Load the file
%1
   REM Cloak executable
ren %1.EXE %1.PVW
:END

For example to load fil INFECTME.EXE, enter

  Load INFECTME

  This procedure will work if the virus in not memory resident.
