I was a virus writer for a time a few years ago - I wrote a few you might
recognize - and I _never_ engaged in what you are calling a "calculated
act" to inflict damage, pain and suffering on others. The viruses I wrote
were merely exercises in attempting to beat anti-virus software, or just
personal experiments in seeing how sophisticated I could make the things. I
never distributed these to anyone I didn't trust (I gave them to a CAROboard,
and that was it).

I very strongly object to being called a "terrorist" or being engaged in a
"cowardly evil." I should point out many anti-virus researchers have done as
much as I have done. I have never bombed or killed. I would hate to think
anyone suffered any problems as a result of my viruses. That's why I never
would give them to anyone who would do that with them.

One thing I _do_ regret was writing a certain virus creation tool whose name
I'd rather not state here. At the time it just seemed like a fun thing to do,
but it made writing simple, destructive articles that blindly hack away at a
hard drive that much easier to make. I don't know of any recorded problems as
a result of it, and I'd hate to think there were any.

This was an event in my past, and I wouldn't involve myself in it anymore
(for one thing, I just don't have the time).

I wouldn't have, for one.

Thank you. I object to being called a terrorist, or even an
ex-terrorist.

I never met any that did. I'm sure some exist somewhere, but writing a viable
virus these days, other than perhaps a Word macro thing, is usually too much
work for the average lamer. (Little MS-DOS .COM infectors are effectively
pointless.)

Well, it is to some extent a power thing, you must realize. There's a feeling
of power from being able to penetrate the security of an AV program. (And it
used to be _very_ easy to do.)

Yeah, 95% of all viruses are totally uninteresting. I don't know what their
writers were thinking. What's the point of writing something that this virus
over here already does better, anyway?

You judge...why be a virus writer?
