  Greetings to all virus writers/enthusiasts,

  This is issue No.4 of the Pinoy Virus Writers Ezine !!! Well actually
  I started this issue while I was finishing issue #3. I was just waiting for
  my friend Mandragore to submit his promised virii after finishing hiz kewl
  game .

  Much has happened for PVW. A lot have emailed me to comment on the group
  and our webpage,thanx 2 all af ya! I also subscribed to some Filipino
  related virus echo mail which my friend Psk (phvx@hotmail.com) has
  informed me. He is the Editor/Author of the zine HEX-FILES. He has been a
  great help, we often give info to each other ,mabuhay ka kaibigan!Also to
  Renegade which the 'restricted email contact' for the Vx was so good to be
  true...maybe someday my friend they will see what you want them to see.

  About the lamer list, it will be there as long as my site exists.
  It will be a time capsule to to every lamer listed there ,hehehe ,you'll
  be flamed 4 d rest of yer stinking lives !!! Specially to that Green blooded
  homosexual neanthertal student of AMA-CLC Sta. Mesa , Marlon Ballelos...
  I hope you die, the die again, and again then rot in hell!

  I am currently thingking of a new look to the zine. I'm still playing some
  ASCII codes to do the job. Also a file reader would be kewl, if I have the
  time to program it. Maybe in the next issue.

  There is A macro virii posted here coz , made by Kryten my newest member
  He's bloody English :-). I'm learning to code macro virii to expext to see
  some macro virii in the next issues to come (hopefully). The release of this
  zine may have a longer interval to the last issue becoz i have *LOTS* of
  things to do and on my mind. I'm still the editor in chief of this zine and I
  still don't have plans to seek some help ,yet coz I can still manage...maybe
  if things don't work out...I still have my members to help me out. They keep
  those article coming !

  Due to the deletion of my webpage and account at Tripod I was forced to
  relocate my website. Thanks to the Admin of SourceOfKaos.com my site found a
  new home...the addy is:
  ş http://sourceofkaos.com/homes/brianjan

  Also I'd like to encourage by beloved Filipino virus writers to let
  themselves be heared. I am still accepting members. I know there are a lot
  there, just looking at the Pinoy made virii sources available around.
  A lot of them isn't into the Net yet.I hope soon they will be.Like a
  classmate of mine now who says hes been in active for a while and doent
  have a webpage first.I still encouraging him to join my ring.

  There are also some Norwegian text that I included, like in issue #3 so that
  my Norwegian friends/virus writers could enjoy the zine. English is not really
  used there althought most can understand. I'm still learning the language
  though.;-)

  About my babies...they are all written in HLL(high Level Languages)
  specifically Turbo Pascal, I know most of the coders out there think HLL are
  pretty lame and slow and bulky but incorporating them with ASM works well!
  I admit that ASM is the best language to write virii, but how about macro
  virii which is becoming very popular nowadays? isnt; it written in some what
  HLL? Well, for those critics dont worry, I'm learning to code in pure ASM and
  not just incorporating it in HLLs.

  Typo..err,Typer..umm,Spelling errors:
  There are a lot here considering my pathetic typing skills and soreing eyes,
  (Hey I just got new eyeglasses!),so bear with me. I am just using a simple
  DOS text editor to create this zine, and it doeznt have spell checking.
  Some words r in filipino coz I am one but I try to put some translation
  in (((enlosed parentheses))).

  Well thats about it,Hope u enjoy the zine...or else.

Special thanx to Putok sa Kawayan (PhVx@hotmail.com) for the the AV info
on my babies (see PVW4.015).
