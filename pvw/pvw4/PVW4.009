Name : Zoom23
Born : Some time in August 1978.( Born ? I was coded !!! )


  Zoom23 started his computer underground activities back in 1996. That was
when he extensively used computers in school. Hacker at first, his exploits
were cracking programs, changing software copyrights, pirating software,
mingling with the school's LAN and translating MS-DOS 6.22 into his native
language "Tagalog".
  In the middle of all these, he found himself experimenting with virusr. He
was intrigued. He soon found a home in virus writing. Spending countless hours
reding books and experimenting on them until he created his own overwriting
virus, and then came some more.
  Eventually he discovered the Internet as a medium. By late 1996 he
established his own website , and as common to all newbies , content lacks his
site. By early 1997, he decided to join various hacking / virus hacking groups
which paved way in creating more viruses. Though included in these vx groups he
was not active in their activities. He thought there was something missing.
After a few months of surfing, posting in newsgroups, learning C and Assembly
language he formed his own webring, the "Pinoy Virus Writers" webring,
definitely 100% Filipino made. There were few members at start but as they sat
it's still a start. His first attempt of publishing an electronic magazine
merely 6 pages long draw quite an attention. Like his first attempt to have a
webpage so is the content of his zine. By mid 1998 after taking almost a
quarter of year long vacation in Norway he released a second issue. Like his
first this one also drew attention ,but this time friendly comments and
praises. That was enough for him to pursue in creating more issues of his zine.
  By now Zoom23 is still learning as much as he can about these digital
artificial life he creates and breed. One day he may be known as one of the
pionners in Filipino virus writing community on the net. He may or may not
comtinue this after a few years, but he will surely make a mark in Vx
community, and placing the Philippines a part of the elite computer underground
before he leaves. he will not entirely disappear but merely gaze behind the
spotlight. He will always be there, he will always breed what he gave birth, he
will always make sure to keep the infection alive...
