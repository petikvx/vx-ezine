         No, Windows is not a virus. Here's what viruses do:
      1. They replicate quickly - okay windows does that.
      2. Viruses use up valuable system resources,slowing down the system as
      they do so- okay windows does that.
      3. Viruses will from time to time, trash your harddisk- okay windows does
      that too.
      4. Viruses are usually carried,unknown to the user,along with valuable
      programs and sytems. Sigh... windows does that too.
      5. Viruses will occssionaly make the user suspect that their system is
      too slow (see 2) and the user will buy new hardware.
      Yup, that's what windows does too.

          Until now it seems Windows is a virus but there are fundamental
      differences: Viruses are well supported by their Authors, are running on
      most systems,their program code is fast, compact and efficient and they
      tend to become more sophisticated as they mature.
          So Windows is not a virus.
          It's a bug.
