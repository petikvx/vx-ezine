Subject :
P.V.W.'s Interview with Putok Sa Kawayan, HexFiles Zine Editor/Creator.
** Interview done via E-mail.


1. What is your Handle/Call Name Group affiliation and why did you chose 
it?

I go by the name Putoksa Kawayan. How did I come to choose that name?  
When I started writing viruses, I thought of something that you would 
not mistake for a nationality other than Filipino. I first thought of 
Lantaka, bamboo cannon, because it comes with a bang :) But, it could 
still be mistaken for Chinese or Japanese. So I choose something closer 
to that which is Putoksa Kawayan, or, literally, blast from a bamboo. I 
joined "putok" and "sa" into one word so that it would look nice. That's 
the long and short of it.

I am not a member of any virus group but I will support any Pinoy virus 
group or anything Pinoy in the net, for that matter.


2. When did you got interested in computer underground/virii 
programming?

When I was in high school I learned to write programs in assembly on my 
own. I relied on books and some codes in mags. But it doesnt really 
teach you everything. The only readily available assembly programs that 
you could unravel without bothering your conscience are viruses. Thats 
how Possessed of Gumba became my teacher. Since assembly is very boring 
at first, I have to think of a motivation to continue with the learning 
process -- create my own virus.


3. What programming languages are you most likely to work with?

I am most comfortable with assembly and I like writing programs in that 
language. Have you heard about that ad on tv - "I've got the power". 
That's how I felt with assembly.


4. Who or what group influenced you most?

I don't think anyone in particular has influenced me. Although, at the 
start it is Possessed of Jonjon Gumba which thought me how to go about 
things in assembly. 

But when you read codes, viral or non-viral, you get ideas from them, 
whether you like it or not. Its something like that subliminal thing. 
Your brain is like a sponge that absorbs everything you read. (Whether 
what you read goes out through the your ears, is another matter.) What 
you see and read would influence you somehow, some way.


5. What group/author/works you like best?/recommend?

If you are Filipino and wanted to join a virus group, I suggest you join 
PVW. 

Cut that crap about forming your own group. This is a fast changing 
environment. People come and go. Wouldnt it be nice that a Pinoy group 
is still up there when the original people who put it up is no longer 
coding viruses.


6. Do you think virii writing is just a teenage thing?

Black Baron of SMEG fame is not. I think V2PX author, (Is it Washburn?), 
is also not a teenager. But you have to accept the fact that most virus 
coders are about that age. 

What usually happens is that after you finish school you get to find 
work and when you work you have less time. After finding work, you get 
married and have a family. (It is different if you get someone pregnant. 
It messes up the turn of events.) As time passes by, your priorities 
changes. You find less time for things like virus coding, if not no time 
at all. You are trying to make a living. That I think is the reason for 
that teenage thingy. Its all about priorities and time.

In due time, you and me, would also go that way. 


7. When did you first started writing HEX Files and why?

I released HEX-FILES No. 1 on the  third or fouth week of December 1997. 
I started on this late October or early November, but most of it were 
done December of that year. But it was a rush rush because I wanted it 
out before 1997 ends, for no particular reason. It was released through 
the web sites of Cicatrix and Guillermito, from both of whom I got lots 
of things -- I did hatak and hatak.

When I first got into the net, I found my way into pro-virus sites. 
There, I got hold of viruses which I only saw in the virus lists of avs 
before. After looking at them, I said that my virus are better than some 
of them. So I decided to come out with what I have written. The zines I 
know of is mostly by virus groups. Since I have no intention of joining 
one, why not have one of my own. I patterned the zine after 40HEX, which 
I like.

At that time, there were no Filipino virus group nor zine. Local virus 
authors have only one course to make their works known, by releasing it 
in the wild. I am presenting them with another option, just as what PVW 
zine does.


8. What viruses have you written lately?

I haven't got the time to work on something lately. It is not that hard 
to write a virus. But what is hard to do, is to make your virus 
different, in a way, from the others. 

The last one I did was Kontragapi. Although June12.Sentenaryo came after 
that, it is not my own. I only rearranged and streamlined June12.

What I'd like to do is write something not encrypted and all those AVs 
couldnt find it. I'd also like to do a 32-bit infector but couldn't 
afford to do it. Got nothing to test it on. I got no back up and no 
install disks. BSA would come running after me if they learn my Windows 
is a certified original copy from China courtesy of my friendly 
neighborhood computer shop, of course, at a price. 


9. Ever tried in the field of hacking/phreaking?

No. At present, I have no interest in that field.


10. With the influx of many virus generators what can you say about the 
quality on these virii or the virii at wild today?

Virus generators are good only for those who do not know how to write 
their own virus or are too lazy to create their own. The only 
construction kit generated virus you would see in the wild are those 
created by macro kits. And, there are good macro kits out there.

For DOS viruses, I have seen some generators and I didnt like them. But 
it's a different thing for encryption engines, which should not be 
classified as generator.

The only drawback for kit generated viruses is that they are easily 
detected by avs. 

But for those who dont know how to write a virus, it's a miracle.

What is sucky for one person might be a wow! for another.


11. Any parting words?

I have no plans yet of leaving the virus scene. So let us put aside that 
parting word until the day I say paalam to the virus scene. :) 

I know what you mean but lets leave it as it is. :)
