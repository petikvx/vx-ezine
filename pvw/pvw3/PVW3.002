                            ş A THOUGHT ş
                      ( A word for the Newbies )


      When I first started using computers ,I've always felt this great desire
to attain power in this computing environment . Once I became a virus writer ,
I had the desire for others to learn what I know and acquire the power I have,
leaving my signature on them. It became a real joy of mine when I created my
first virus after hundred times of debugging,compilation and experimention and
it ran. It was the beggining of more to come. But the saddest part of knowing
them and loving them is knowing people who does'nt understand them nor even
know what it is .It came to all just recently.
       I was taking a vacation in Norway Spring of 1998 ,when my 12 year old
Norwegian cousin asked me what am I doing in those countless hours in front of
the computer. I smiled. I said I write "stuff". "What stuff ?" she said curious-
ly. Then I said viruses. "Data viruses" her norwegian friend replied with a
Norsk accent. My cousin looked puzzled as she asked me again. Luckily her
friend let me explain for I can't explain the technical stuff in Norwegian.
It is still possible for a country with such advance technology and with early
exposure to computers even know what a computer virus is.
       By the time I went back to Manila, I told myself I must not just write
virus codes I must also inform people it is not as dangerous as cancer like
the press tells it. Hoaxes and false information actually does more harm than
good. Viruses are not chaotic but rather follow a pattern, hence in organized
manner. You don't actually have to know how to write a virus but rather know
their behavior and effects.
       For those who would want to understand and experiment on them, I am
encouraging for them to do so for the purpose of knowing not destroying and all
experiments must be in a controlled environment. After all life exists even in
the digital world, and we're the ones who keeps the infection alive ...
