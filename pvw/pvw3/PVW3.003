ฑ   I said before in the last issue about the "SHE" virus and the "Ala-eh" ฑ
ฑ    strains . Some commented on that.I assumed Chrono Trigger wrote the    ฑ
ฑ    "SHE" virus bcoz he authored the an AV just for removing it .Probably  ฑ
ฑ    to play safe if he got infected with his own virus accidentally. Now   ฑ
ฑ    this is only a hunch .And as I said the similarity of the two viruses  ฑ
ฑ    is mainly bcoz of the way they infect and their payloads...but i haventฑ
ฑ    seen it's disassebly or source yet so I cant be entirely correct. PsK  ฑ
ฑ    (Putok sa Kawayan) has the disassembly of these viruses which he says  ฑ
ฑ    belongs to the Wc_bats Virii family . If you want to check it out try  ฑ
ฑ    downloading a copy of his zine HEXFILES #4 which is still on writing   ฑ
ฑ    as i am now and maybe due september or october 98 according to him.    ฑ

ฑ  the header says 'MZ',they are both EXE files! the first data file is the ฑ
ฑ  actual file browser & the onther one i dont know coz it hanged when i    ฑ
