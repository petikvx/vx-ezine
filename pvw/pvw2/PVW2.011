 I've just went to read the articles in the alt.comp.virus.source.code
  at Dejanews today and i have'nt read anything there for a while .then
  I saw this FAQ file .It is pretty good actually and i thought of
  publishing it in this zine coz it contains alot of info on viruses and
  links . It will help you a lot if you decide to subscribe in these news-
  group ( if you have'nt yet :-) ) .  - Zoom23
  Here it is ...

DN - alt.comp.virus.source.code FAQ

  This faq intended to establish some guidlines for this newsgroup, and to
provide a list of virus and assembly related resources. It has been divided
into 4 parts:

  1) Do's and Don'ts
  2) Questions and Answers
  3) Resources
  4) Misc.

   The Misc section will be for advertising your group you want ppl to
join, or anything else that doesn't fit into the other 3 catagories. Comments
and suggestions are welcome, just post them to this group, or send them to
aperson@the-pentagon.com .


                          Part I  Do's And Don'ts

  a.c.v.s.c ought to be a place for the discussion of viruses and related
materials (ie, AV products, writing
techniques, etc.) and a place where you
can post viruses you have written IN SOURCE CODE, and pretty much post any
source you would like to post, as long as it is a virus, and was not produced
with a code generator, like VCL, or is a 'hack'.  However,
if you have
written a virus generator, feel free to post it, in source.
Now, on to the Do's And Don'ts! :)

Do's:

 * Please, please, post some original source! A few sources of viruses
that have been around for a while, or one that you just thought
were
especialy cool would be fine, as well. :)

 * Help the newbies. But, don't feel like you have to spoon feed them either.
Not that many of you do, anyway. If they are jerks be a jerk back at them, I
don't care. But, if they ask a question that
wasn't covered in here, and they
weren't overly arrogant, plz answer it. If it gets asked alot I can always
add it to this FAQ.

 * Help me add sites and verify sites on the resources list periodicly. <G>
Dead links never helped anyone.

 * Do
have some knowledge of 80x86 assembly (or whatever language you plan to
program in) before you come in here asking for help on writing viruses. You
WILL NOT be spoon fed.

 * Viruses written in a language other than assembly are ok, just expect to
be
flamed. Almost all good viruses are written in ASM. I am sure there are a
few exceptions (KRiLE), though.

Don'ts:

 * DO NOT POST ASSEMBLED SOURCE CODE!! NO LIVE VIRUSES. SOURCE CODE ONLY!!

 * Please don't ask a question that was covered in here
(this FAQ), unless
you just didn't understand the answer.

 * Don't post trojan horses.  Only self-replicating programs are wanted.

 * Don't say: "I have such-and-such virus. How do I get rid of it?"
That is what alt.comp.virus, and
comp.virus is for.

 * Don't post code from a code generator. Also, plz don't post a 'hack' of a
virus you made.

 * DON'T ACT ARROGANT! Newbies especially. If you are a jerk, expect to be
flamed, shunned, and beat with a large stick. <G> j/k
about the stick. But,
you will not be a liked person.

 * Don't ask for A virus.  If you want a specific one - sure, but not the
same old "Can someone send me a virus, pleez?"

 * Please don't ask what do you do with an ASM file. If you
don't know, go
away. (until you know more. <G>)



 * No ME TOOS!!! Ok? You aren't going to join a list by posting your email.
Can you say SPAM?


                                Part II  Q&amp;A


 Q: "Can you send me viruses that I
can send to ppl I don't like?"

 A: Well... I personally won't.  Perhaps some other ppl in the NG would help
you out, I dunno. :P But, IMHO, that isn't quite the reason ppl write
viruses. And not all viruses are destructive, anyhow. Get/write a
Trojan.
Works much better.


 Q: "What is the plural of virus?"

 A: Viruses is the correct plural.  Virii is slang.  There is no need to
argue over it... it is just slang... like ain't, and ppl.


 Q: "Can you plz add me to the mailing
list?"

 A: Eh... Sorry, Bucko, There is no mailing list... It is simply a ploy by
spammers to get e-mail addresses to send thier crap to. Sorry. If I am wrong,
however, (Which I will almost garuntee I am not) then I will apologize and
remove
this question.


 Q: "Can a virus damage hardware?"

 A: Well... You will most likely NEVER find ANY piece of software that will
damage hardware physically. The only way I can think to break a harddrive
with software is to write a program
that constantly accesses the disk, and
leave that disk on for say... oh... 2 years? :P The disk will die from normal
wear and tear. But, I have heard of moniters being broken by software, but
that is extremely rare, and the moniter is a cheap thing
with no safety
mechanisms, plus, the code would have to so specific that there would be no
point in doing it. Besides, the moniter would have to be on for hours (maybe
days) for the damaging effect to take place. Almost all new moniters will not
be
damaged like that, unless they are just really really crappy.


 Q: "Is there such thing as a virus that automaticicly executes when you read
your email?"

 A: Nope. Email is text. That is all. In order for a virus to begin to
spread, it
must be executed. Text cannot be exucuted. To show my point, copy
this file to acvsc.exe, and run it. Make sure nothing important is running
when you do this. <G>
Please don't contribute to the fallicy that they can be spread like that.
BTW-
'Join the Crew', 'Goodtimes', 'DEEYENDA', 'Penpal Greetings',
'Badtimes', etc, are all examples of this.  They are NOT real viruses.


 Q: "What is the point? (to writing viruses)"

 A: Well, that depends on your point of view.  For some
(typically the
lamers), it
is an overwhelming desire to screw ppl over. :P  For others, it is just a fun
thing to do with thier time.  Others just to see if they can do it, or to
learn more about thier OS, and computers in general.  There are many
reasons
besides that, those were just on the top of my head.


 Q: "|-|0W |)0 I B3C0m3 /-\ 31337 |-|ax0r3r?"

 A: Wrong NG, dope.  Learn to spell. L3\/\/z3r. ;)


 Q: "Where can i get an assembler?"

 A: A86:
    http://eji.com/a86/index.htm
    TASM/TLINK: (btw - tasm/tlink are copyrighted!)...
    ftp://ftp.ilf.net/pub/users/rickdogg/tasm.zip
    MASM:
Stay away from it. If it is all you have go ahead, but TASM is best!

 Q: "Where can I get a debugger?"

 A: Once again, try some virus sites, and A86's distro site. :). There are
many shareware debuggers available. Try and find D86,
A86's debugging
counterpart. :)


 Q: "Can you make me a custom virus?"

 A: NO!  We can help you learn to make a custom virus, but we will not make
you one.  Write your own. Well, actually... perhaps if you would pay enough
;)

 Q:
"Are there any books about compter viruses available?"

 A: Mark Ludwig has several, I believe. Try looking him up at www.amazon.com
I am sure that if you looked hard enough you would be able to find several on
the subject, the question is
just that of thier quality. :)


 Q: "Can I make a virus in QBasic?"

 A: Yep. Pretty much any language can be used, just some are easier than
others, and/or generate smaller code. For an example QB virus, look in the
'a.c.v.s.c HLL FAQ',
written by Techno Phunk. They can be compiled with
Qbasic 4.5.
