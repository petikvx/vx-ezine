  This is an example of an overwritting virus written in Assembly language
  which most says the best language to write a virus because of it's small
  oblect code ,speed ,and low level manipulations that a high level language
  mostly cannot offer. When ran this will infect all ".EXE" file in current
  directory andd will cause larger programs to display "Program too big to fit
  in memory ".Again do not use this virus to destroy , the purpose is to
  educate NOT destroy .Dont be a lamer , GROW UP .

  " Keep the infection alive ... "
