   Hackers and cyberpunks have received a lot of attention lately.  From the Los
Angeles Times to Newsweek, from the famous WarGames movie to the detailed
exploits of Robert Morris, the Internet worm creator.  Exposes of the  computer 
underground  are terrifying many individuals into a deep computer phobia.  The
perception is that bands of angry, antisocial adolescents are waiting in the
wings to wreak havoc on the nation's nuclear arsenal, monetary supply, and space
programs.

   The reality is that there is a far greater information security risk from the
administrative assistant whose insurance premium was bumped and wages frozen
than from any Legion of Doom member.

   In retailing, the greatest proportion of larceny occurs among internal
employees.  The same goes for IS and others who have access to information
systems.  The users who have privileges within accounting systems, databases,
and confidential records are more apt to err or sabotage the system than a rogue
hacker.  Assuming that the network manager or MIS director has implemented
sufficient security procedures and protocols (nonpublished dial-in numbers,
adequate levels of password protection, delayed modem pickup, enforcement of
good passwords, and timely password changes), for a vast majority of
organizations, the threat of a hacker getting into the LAN is insignificant.  It
is the quiet end-user lurking in the inside who has the greatest potential for
destruction.

   For those who still have a fear of the cyberpunk, it is crucial to realize
that the cyberpunk is interested in a few, select establishments.  Organizations
such as MITRE, NASA, FDIC, DOD, Blue Cross, SRI, Chemical Bank, and TRW are far
more fascinating and alluring than the standard businesses that have no
far-reaching impact.

   Would you spend 12 hours attempting to penetrate the 10-user archaic LAN at
Irving Tire & Auto?  Most ordinary business LANs such as Irving Tire have
nothing more than megabytes of boring memos, monotonous reports, and dull
databases.  No self-respecting hacker would spend an entire evening rummaging
through such systems.  There is simply no reward for the hacker in doing such.
For the vast majority of American businesses that are not part of the Fortune
500 or defense contractors, the fear of a hacker is simply more hype than                                                                       PAGE   64

reality.

   The real danger is perceiving the hype as reality.  If an MIS staff spends
its time chasing the nonexistent hacker, the real internal security breach will
only continue to spread.  That is one trojan horse that even the best security
software couldn't identify.

   Two critical and effective proactive measures in any info-security system are
the distribution of a clear and understandable information systems policy manual
and the separation of duties among staff.

   Telltale signs, such as key technical or financial staff members who never
take vacations or reject any concept of cross-training or promotion, are
indicators that some time of indiscretion may be occurring.  Cross-training and
separation of duties are key steps to take to curtail any info-security
predicament.

   It is far more glamorous and exciting to chase a hacker across three
continents with the NSA and Interpol at your side than to discipline a
disgruntled data entry clerk on the seventh floor.  Yet it must be realized that
there is only one Clifford Stoll but thousands of perturbed employees and
breaches that need to be mended.  As soon as the hype is discarded and the
dreams of being another James Bond are abandoned, one may finally tackle the
real info-security issues.  But until then, the losses mount and the breach
grows and grows.

   In today's high-tech world, even small businesses have elaborate,
computerized phone systems. Now the Better Business Bureau is warning of an
increase in phone scams using these complex systems.

   The BBB says the scams, which can run up thousands of dollars of
long-distance telephone charges, are frequently the work of prison inmates who
use various methods to gain access to an outside company's telephone lines in
order to place the unauthorized calls.

   In one scenario, the BBB says, an inmate calls the company, claiming to be a
new employee who does not have an access code and needs an outside line.  Once
this information is given and he has an open line, the scam operator, many of
whom are skilled  computer hackers,  are free to place calls across the country
and world.

   The company is unaware that anything is wrong until it receives an
exceptionally high phone bill. In many cases, the businesses must pay for these
calls, the BBB says.

   The bureau advises businesses to understand all the capabilities of their
elaborate phone systems by checking with the vendors who sold the equipment.
Any vendor should be able to describe the fraud-defense features of its system,
the BBB says.

    An Oshawa-area youth has been charged with defrauding the cellular telephone
network run by Rogers Cantel Inc. of $ 500,000 worth of long-distance telephone
calls.

   The alleged theft took place last spring and fall, Cantel's director of fraud
and security, Clive Woodrow, said in an interview yesterday.

   The suspect cannot be identified because he was less than 17 years old at the
time charges were laid.

   The suspect allegedly charged long-distance calls to Cantel customers' phone
numbers by using a computer to gain illegal access to their voice mailboxes and
changing the greetings, Woodrow said.

   The greetings were then apparently used to approve calls billed to the Cantel
customers' numbers, Woodrow said.

   A small number of customers were affected, he said. Some $ 200,000 worth of
the calls were made to a single Cantel phone number over a 17-day period, he
said.

   Cantel blames Bell Canada's new automated long-distance billing service and
is locked in a dispute with Bell over which firm should shoulder the bulk of the
losses.

   Since the alleged theft, Cantel has begun offering customers a service that
prevents their cellular telephones from accepting third-party bills, he said.

   Long-distance fraud costs North American firms an estimated $ 2 billion a
year, telecommunications consultant Ian Angus said.

   Much is conducted by  computer hackers  who gain illegal access to telephone
networks by figuring out how to break the access codes.

Hackers warn they'll either be working for you or against you.  Can you believe
anything they say?

   SCOTT CHASIN is a young man working in what some people insist will be one of
the growth jobs of the 1990s -- cracking and entering computer systems.  He has
remarkable qualifications, only some don't appear on his resume.  A member of
the Legion of Doom hacker group -- notorious for penetrating and disrupting
telephone company systems -- Chasin, while never convicted, has had his brushes
with the law.  He now works full-time managing personal computer networks for
Amoco in Houston.

   Chasin claims that since his Legion of Doom days he hasn't done anything
illegal.  However, he still spends several hours a night exploring the
 computer underground.   "I want to keep my hand in what's going on," he
explains.  "The technology changes incredibly fast." Chasin has good reason to
stay on top of his game: He moonlights as a computer security consultant, he
says, paid by clients to safeguard their computers from people . . . like he
used to be.

   Hackers are generally an annoyance to the business world, burrowing into
corporate databases and leaving taunts -- or worse.  In 1992 alone, U.S.
companies were struck with more than $ 2 billion in unauthorized phone bills,
according to Telecommunications Advisors, Inc.  Now, however, a more pragmatic
population of hackers is moving into its 20s and 30s.  Like most people in that
age group, they are looking for a little job security.  Many, like Chasin and
the self-proclaimed dean of hackers, Ian Murphy, say they intend to find it in
the corporate world, preferably in a position that takes advantage of their
unique skills.  Whether as industrial spies or as computer security consultants,
hackers say they are entering the work force to do good.  Then again, they may
be lying.
 
Beats slinging hash at McDonald's
There are a number of ways hackers can make money from their trade, and they
seem to be exploring all of them.  "These kids don't want to give up hacking to
sling hash at a McDonald's" notes Gail Thackary, a deputy attorney for Maricopa
County, Ariz., who became a well-known hacker-buster with the Philadelphia                                                                       PAGE   83
                           Forbes, September 13, 1993                           

district attorney's office in the mid-1980s.

   Some hackers hope to become software vendors, selling polished versions of
programs they swap among themselves.  One hacker, known as Video Vindicator, is
preparing to distribute a program that scrambles confidential data files -- from
marketing databases to a bookie's accounting records -- making them unreadable
without the appropriate passwordlike code.  A second program will help identify
cellular phone transmission frequencies, a product, he notes, that will be of
interest to drug dealers and other dubious characters looking for untappable
phone lines.  "I'm hoping to make a couple of million the first year," he says,
without a trace of irony.

   Fraud is another way to make hacking pay.  Stealing credit card numbers from
credit bureaus and other sources has long been a hacker mainstay.  But as credit
bureaus grow more adept at protecting card numbers and hackers' appetites for
equipment and cushy lifestyles grow, other, more lucrative crimes are becoming
attractive.  Tapping into bank networks and electronically hijacking money is
one increasingly popular undertaking.  Counterfeiting money and negotiable
securities with high-tech photocopying systems is another.  "We're seeing the
merging of criminal computer activity with more traditional criminal activity,"
says special agent John Lewis of the Secret Service, which along with the FBI
investigates computer fraud.

   Many hackers and some security professionals insist that companies have hired
hackers to go after competitors.  "It's absolutely true, and I know it from
first-hand experience," says John O'Leary, director of education for the
Computer Security Institute, San Francisco.  "I can't say I've seen a contract,
but I know of a company that has hired a hacker to break in."

   The Secret Service's Lewis and supervisory special agent for the FBI's
Economic Crime Unit, Harold Hendershot, both say the threat may be a real one.
"Hackers have probably been hired for this," says Hendershot.

   Competitive intelligence consultants comprise one rumored source of
employment for industrial spy-hackers.  These small firms are hired by larger
companies to snoop out data on competitors, ostensibly via computer searches of
publicly accessible databases and other legitimate sources.  But by all
accounts, some of these companies are hired on a no-questions-asked basis with
the understanding that they'll do whatever it takes to get the goods.
"Competitive intelligence companies are all sleazy; they're brokers for
thieves," says Gary Johnson, senior investigator with the Harris County district
attorney's office in Houston, who is experienced in hacker cases.  He says
managers could be buying information stolen by hackers without knowing it or
being only dimly aware of the situation.

   Hackers looking for employment opportunities can supposedly turn to the
hacker-operated computer bulletin board services.  These services are located
throughout the United States and abroad, and are accessible by anyone with a
computer and modem.  Although most of the material posted on the hacker boards
is juvenile blather about sex, computer games and societal ills, many of these
boards have "elite" sections that can be entered only by proving one's hacking
expertise via quizzes, references or phone interviews.  It may be here that
hackers get down to business.                                                                       PAGE   84
                           Forbes, September 13, 1993                           

   "If I want information on XYZ Corp., all I have to do is post a note offering
to swap a 359-megabyte hard drive in exchange," says Jim Kates, vice-president
of Stamford, Conn.-based Janus, a computer security firm.  Kates has learned how
to bluff his way onto the elite boards and says he sees notes like that "all the
time."

   But none of the dozens of hackers, computer security consultants, corporate
information systems managers or law enforcement agents specializing in computer
crime who were interviewed for this article could provide any verifiable
evidence of hacker espionage.

   The larger, more established security consultants -- typically attached to
Big Six accounting firms since their services grew out of financial auditing
practices -- downplay the threat.  "The mythical overseas hacker going after
companies isn't a big problem," says Alan James, manager of information
technology assurance services for Coopers & Lybrand in Los Angeles.  "Generally
speaking, employees accidentally deleting files is a bigger problem." Harry
DeMaio, national marketing director of information protection services for
Deloitte & Touche, Wilton, Conn., contends that his clients are much more
concerned about the accessibility and accuracy of their data than they are about
competitors getting their hands on it.  "Defense contractors, credit bureaus,
and toy and cosmetics manufacturers worry about the confidentiality of their
data," he says.  "But for most companies it's almost a negligible issue."

   Hackers maintain that computer security professionals dismiss the threat of
hired hackers either because they don't realize what's going on in the
 computer underground,  or because they know they can't protect against it.  To
do so, they claim, you need to have been a hacker yourself.
 
Jekyll or Hyde?
Switching from malicious hacker to hackers' nemesis is a more natural transition
then may at first seem likely.  "It's almost a rite of passage to first be
convicted of some computer crime and then try to find work as a computer
security consultant," says Michael Alexander, editor-in-chief of Info-Security
News, a bimonthly magazine for the computer security industry.

   Although few hackers are known to have made it as security consultants, those
who dream of being rewarded for shutting down their colleagues can find a role
model of sorts in Ian Murphy.  Captain Zap, as Murphy is known on the hacker
bulletin boards, first won a name for himself with his 1981 bust for, among
other things, breaking into the White House's computers.

   Murphy claims to be hired on a regular basis to carry out various computer
security chores for corporations.  Most notably, he performs penetration tests,
in which he attempts to break into clients' computers to identify their
vulnerabilities to hacker attack.  To get his hands on passwords and other
computer documentation, he routinely sifts through dumpsters outside his
clients' buildings, he claims, even going so far as to physically break into
facilities, as he says he did at United Airlines' Saddlebrook, N.J., reservation
center.

   Needless to say, getting paid to break into a company's computers without
risk of arrest is a hacker's fantasy, and Murphy loves to lord it over other
hackers.  "I'm the only hacker on the planet who's doing this sort of thing," he
says.  Adding to his hubris, People magazine ran a flattering profile of him,                                                                       PAGE   85
                           Forbes, September 13, 1993                           

and the computer industry trade magazine Information Week put Murphy on the
cover, unquestioningly reporting his self-described exploits and his claimed
earnings of up to $ 500,000 a year.  (Murphy repeatedly telephoned to push for
the cover slot of this supplement.)

   Murphy is a playfully obnoxious, pudgy 36-year-old who lives with his parents
in their Philadelphia home.  His phone conversations are punctuated by shouting
matches with his mother, who becomes particularly riled when her son risks
electrocution by staying on the phone during thunderstorms.  (A budding romance
with his Federal Express delivery-woman has kept the twice-divorced digital
swashbuckler out of the home as of late.) At times, Murphy seems to have a
little trouble separating fantasy from reality.  He rants about building
battery-powered devices that will wipe out all nearby electronic chips with a
massive electromagnetic pulse.  He says his company, IAM/Secure Data Systems, is
being taken public.  He brags about a lucrative book deal that never quite
materializes.  Murphy also refuses to provide the names of corporations on whose
behalf he has supposedly hacked, claiming he is bound by nondisclosure
agreements.  He did participate in a Peat, Marwick & Mitchell-run penetration
test fo the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (now defunct) in 1986.  "Ian
performed in a satisfactory way," says a former partner of Peat, Marwick (not
Peat Marwick KPMG).  "But we kept a very close eye on him."
 
The "backdoor" trick
If Murphy is a role model, it is only for the dishonest hacker who is unsuitable
for security work, fumes prosecutor Thackary.  Rumor has it that Murphy has on
occasion sent companies unsolicited information about other hackers along with a
bill.  "All that proves is that he's willing to sell out his friends in the
underground," she says.  (Murphy denies such marketing tactics and insists he
doesn't turn in other hackers.) Not surprisingly, other law enforcement figures
who have dedicated their careers to shutting down hackers are less than charmed
by the notion of hiring exhackers to provide security.  "Have you ever met one
of these kids face-to-face?  They're nerds," says Harris County's Johnson.
"Even the mob wouldn't trust them."

   But Johnson and Thackary's reaction to Murphy and his fellow
hacker/consultants is mild compared to those of computer security professionals.
When Scott Chasin and some of his Legion of Doom pals, including well-known
hacker Chris Goggans, started up a Houston security consulting firm called
Comsec in 1991, they were excoriated in articles and letters published in the
computer trade press.  Chasin claims one prominent security professional
promised to call all of Comsec's prospective clients to warn them off.  "How
would you feel if some young guy who knew all the tricks was entering your line
of work?"

   Among the tricks hackers use to gain access to a company's computers is
leaving a "backdoor" to the system -- a program or password that allows them to
get back in at a latter time.  "What happens if your relationship with a hacker
sours?" asks the Computer Security Institute's O'Leary.  "Now you've got
somebody who has the keys to the kingdom and the motivation to do nasty things."

   Hackers never truly reform, contends Thackary, especially when they hope to
trade on their expertise.  "If they're going to get good information from the
underground on behalf of their clients, they have to be doing something in
return," she says, such as providing information about their employers.
Although hackers don't deny keeping their hands in the game, they claim there                                                                       PAGE   86
                           Forbes, September 13, 1993                           

is not conflict.  "You don't bite the hand that feeds you," Murphy says.

   Such promises, though, smack of extortion: Hire me or I may rip you off.  And
not all hackers adhere to even this dubious guarantee.  Harris County's Johnson
uncovered a scam in which hackers searched out local corporations whose dial-in
computer systems were protected by easily guessable passwords.  They would leave
a harmless virus on the system, contact the company to warn it about a virus
that was "going around" and then offer a free security evaluation.  If a company
bit, the hackers would use the evaluation as a cover to gain access to all of
the company's systems and then insert backdoors for later systems raiding.
 
Clueless "Ken dolls"
Ex-hackers concede their ethics aren't exactly mainstream, but insist they are a
company's best bet.  Conventional security consultants, they say, are simply
clueless about how to defend against hackers.  "The Big Six accounting firms
send over people dressed to the nines like Ken dolls, with degrees in accounting
and psychology, and they're generally incompetent," sneers Murphy.  "While I'm
jumping into dumpsters, they're presenting a report that highly recommends
locking the door to the data center."

   Chasin is equally contemptuous of the industry, claiming that one speaker at
a security industry seminar spent several minutes explaining to the audience of
computer security heads how to load software from a disk into a computer.  "I
just sat there thinking, 'No wonder it was so easy when we were hacking,'" he
says.

   But not all computer security professionals are gray-suit auditor types.  A
short, slightly balding man in his 40s with a friendly, soft-spoken air, Peter
Goldis is the establishment's answer to hackers.  He travels around the world
breaking into clients' computer systems for $ 6,000 to $ 75,000.  The jobs are
often arranged by Coopers & Lybrand, among others, for whom he is a
subcontractor.  He carries with him a loose-leaf binder filled with short
programs he has written to bypass the various security procedures implemented on
mainframes.  One program, entitled "Get Another User's Password in a Top Secret
Shop," comprises 16 surprisingly simple lines, such as "LA 1,PARMS," that cause
the computer to spit out the passwords of employees who are authorized to
control all the machine's operations.  By entering one of these passwords,
Goldis can roam unimpeded throughout the corporate cyberspace.

   Sometimes the job takes 20 minutes, other times a few days.  Goldis says 56
of his 60 penetration tests have been successful, and those that have failed
were retests for clients that had previously implemented his suggested security
fixes.  The ease with which he customarily breaks into systems often shocks his
clients.  "I was hired by a corporation in Australia, and within a few hours I
was far enough into their accounting system to start cutting checks," he
recalls.  Janus' Jim Kates also performs penetration testing, as do most of the
Big Six firms and even IBM, if pushed.

   Though mainstream security professionals tend to downplay penetration testing
as gimmicky, they point out that because legitimate professional can do the job,
there's no need to even consider hiring a hacker.  "Why hire a Chris Goggans
when you can hire a Peter Goldis?" asks InfoSecurity News' Alexander.

   But it's not clear that Peter Goldis or any other mainstream penetration
testers can really simulate a serious hacker attack.  Password cracking is, of                                                                       PAGE   87
                           Forbes, September 13, 1993                           

course, where hackers shine.  Murphy says he has snuck into executives' offices
after hours dressed as a custodian and prowled through countless trash cans.
Video Vindicator claims he and other hackers have a program that can
automatically break passwords on some systems within 30 minutes by trying every
word in the dictionary at a rate of 10,000 words per second.

   Goldis and other security professionals concede that hackers are adept at
breaking through password security.  But they claim companies can't learn much
from the experience because some employees will always be careless about keeping
their passwords secret and there will always be ways to sneak into buildings.
Goldis adds that hackers are most skilled at breaching security on PCs and
Unix-based systems, while corporations' most vital data resides on mainframes.

   But Murphy, Chasin and other hackers insist they can show companies how to
make themselves invulnerable to password-prowling hackers.  In addition, they
say mainframe expertise can be gleaned from readily available sources.  Goldis
has himself picked up many of his best tricks from software manuals that
companies were about to discard.  At any rate, hackers probably need not worry
about mastering mainframes.  Corporations are moving at breakneck speed toward
PC- and Unix-based systems in the form of client/server architectures, which may
place professionals like Goldis and Kates at a disadvantage.  Goldis says he's
studying the subject.

   If hackers to have an edge, why don't more companies hire them to provide
penetration testing or other security services?  Actually, say many hackers,
they do -- they just won't admit it.  Besides being generally reluctant to
discuss security problems, corporate computer security managers recognize that
there is nothing to gain, and a lot to lose, by admitting that they hire
hackers.  Michigan Bell was inundated with negative publicity when word leaked
out in 1989 that it had hired hacker John Maxfield as a security consultant.
The company now can't put enough distance between itself and the incident.  "It
was a poorly conceived idea by one of my ex-bosses," says Craig Granger, current
director of computer security for the phone company.  (The ex-boss is now an
ex-employee, Granger adds.) And when Chasin and friends formed Comsec (which
closed its doors last year), Computerworld, a trade publication, quoted Norman
Sutton, a computer manager at high-tech manufacturer Leemah Datacom, as liking
the idea of learning from hackers.  Now Sutton refuses to discuss the issue,
except to state that he never employed Comsec or any other hackers.

   In any case, companies may be hiring hackers without realizing it.  "I'm not
sure I would present my credentials as a hacker if I were applying for a job,"
says Video Vindicator.  Scott Chasin didn't; his boss at Amoco found out his
promising young hiree was a nationally known hacker only when he saw Chasin on
NBC's "Dateline" breaking into the network's computers.  According to Chasin,
his boss was "tickled." Computer security managers at Exxon might wonder exactly
which possibilities were tickling him.
 
WHY THE THREAT IS GROWING
Companies now have more reason than ever before to fear hacker espionage, thanks
to a number of trends.  Among them:
* GLOBALIZATION The pressures of international competition have spawned the
best-known recent cases of industrial espionage.  Earlier this year the CIA
warned 49 U.S. defense contractors that the French government was preparing to
spy on them, prompting the Pentagon to ask Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed and other
aerospace companies not to participate in the Paris Air Show.  And four giant                                                                       PAGE   88
                           Forbes, September 13, 1993                           

Japanese corporations reportedly bought secret Star Wars computer code in 1990
from a scientist at a hightech defense contractor in California.

   Multinational hacking is already part of the picture.  German hackers are
known to have attacked NASA databases, and law enforcement officials believe
corporations are fair game.  "If I were a developing Eastern European
pharmaceutical company and I wanted a base of information," says Secret Service

special agent John Lewis, "my choices would be to launch a lab program to
develop it or to go somewhere it already existed.  One way would be through
computer intrusion." Harold Hendershop, supervisory special agent for the FBI's
Economic Crime Unit, notes that Sweden-based hacker group the Dream Team (best
known for cracking copy protection on commercial and game software and then
distributing the programs on bulletin boards) is becoming increasingly brazen.
Other hackers say the Dream Team has also begun to engage in corporate
espionage; Hendershot doesn't rule out that possibility.
* THE MOVE TO CLIENT/SERVER ARCHITECTURES Companies have traditionally kept most
of their data either on mainframes, which can be guarded with security software,
or on stand-alone PCs, which usually can't be accessed from the outside.  But as
client/server architectures become increasingly popular, both barriers are
removed.  Servers, which act as data hubs for groups of PCs, typically run the
Unix operating system -- notorious for its lack of mainframe-style security
features and a particular favorite of hackers, many of whom learned their trade
on the Unix-based systems popular at high schools and universities.  What's
more, servers often provide dial-in ports; if a hacker reaches such a server, he
or she would be able to access the attached PCs.
* HACKERS' STEEP LEARNING CURVE Law enforcement agents all agree that hacker's
obsession with sharing information via bulletin boards makes them better able to
stay abreast of the latest tricks of the trade and corporate vulnerabilities
than their adversaries.  "Hackers use open communications as a weapon against
us," says Jim Kates, vice-president of Stamford, Conn.-based computer security
firm Janus.  "Those of us in security don't like to talk about what we find
out."
 
TIGHTENING YOUR SECURITY
Companies tend to rely heavily on password security to prevent their computer
data from falling into the wrong hands, but hackers are adept at guessing or
stealing passwords.  Some additional, often overlooked, ways to protect systems
include the following:
* TURN PCs AND SERVERS OFF AT NIGHT People often let their machines run 24 hours
a day, making them prime targets for after-hours hackers if the machines have
modems or are connected to servers with dial-in ports.
* INSTALL DIAL-BACK PROTECTION These devices allow modems to receive calls but
remain connected only long enough for a caller to enter a password.  The device
then hangs up an calls the employee back at a preapproved phone number.  To gain
access to a system with dial-back protection, a hacker would have to be at a
location with an approved phone number or reprogram the dial-back device with
his or her own number -- a difficult task.
* DISTRIBUTE ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATORS TO EMPLOYEES WHO REQUIRE DIAL-IN ACCESS
These card-deck-sized devices generate new passwords every few seconds in sync
with a device attached to the dial-in system; all an employee has to do is type
in the password displayed by the authenticator.  Even the cleverest and luckiest
hacker usually requires at least several hundred tries to correctly guess a
password; the authenticator demands that you get it right the first time.  And
because the password is constantly changing, it can't be given out or stolen.
* IF A COMPANY MUST RELY ON PASSWORDS, IT SHOULD ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO SELECT                                                                       PAGE   89
                           Forbes, September 13, 1993                           

THEM AS FOLLOWS Settle on a familiar phase, such as "Down and out in Beverly
Hills"; then list the first letter of each word, capitalizing just one of them;
finally, add a number to it.  The resulting password -- something like "daoiBh6"
-- is easy to remember but difficult to guess, even for hackers equipped with
automated password guessers that try every word in the dictionary forwards and
backwards.
* RUN CONFIDENTIAL DATA FILES THROUGH ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE THAT STORES THEM IN
SCRAMBLED FORM Although this doesn't make files any harder for hackers to steal,
they won't be able to make sense of them if they do.
 
THE PROS AND CONS OF HIRING HACKERS
  PROS
* Hackers will usually know the latest tricks other hackers are using to break
into systems and thus will be able to suggest ways to foil them.
* Hackers may be able to pick up advance notice of hacker attacks via
underground contacts or hacker bulletin boards.
* Unlike conventional computer security professionals, hackers are particularly
adept at dealing with PCs and Unix-based servers, which are increasingly where
the action is.
* Hackers can provide penetration tests as realistic as clients are likely to
want.
* Top-notch hackers can offer complete security evaluations -- including
remedies -- for a fraction of the cost of a Big Six accounting firm.
 
CONS
* Reformed hackers may not be completely reformed.  Whether from habit or
paranoia, they could be tempted to leave "backdoors" in your systems that would
allow them to break in at a later date.  Consequently, if your relationship
sours or they grow weary of being corporate players, your systems are sitting
ducks.  Alternatively, hired hackers may offer information about your systems to
their cohorts in exchange for other information.
* Hackers don't like to turn in other hackers.  A hired hacker might help
prevent a hacker attack but leave the attacker free to pry again.
* Hackers usually don't have enough assets to make lawsuits worthwhile, nor is
it likely they will be insured or bonded.  Thus, companies shafted by hired
hackers are left little recourse for compensation.
* Most hackers don't know how to fit into the corporate scene.  They may offend
managers and other employees with arrogant and juvenile attitudes.  And they
might take it upon themselves to perform various acts of simulated theft or
sabotage, ostensibly to raise awareness but needlessly inconveniencing and even
frightening people in the process.

    IN A BLUSTERY Dutch field, four metres below sea level and miles from
anywhere, a man from the CIA was preaching last week to an audience of
anarchists, hippies and computer security consultants.

    Around them, hundreds of tents communed electronically with the rest of the
world through telephone cable and sticky tape. Stories of global mayhem and
local area networks mixed with Hendrix and Kraftwerk: ''Hacking at the End of
the Universe'', the Hack-Tic computer club's 1993 Summer Congress, was underway.

    The call to attend went out earlier this year across the Internet, the giant
computer network which links academia, industry and individuals across the
world. The intended recipients were those who inhabit the shadier areas of that
network. Hackers, techno-anarchists and communications junkies were all
specifically invited, as were the more esoteric ''warez dudes'' - software
pirates - and ''phone phreaks'' - who make free telephone calls without the aid
of 0800 numbers.

    But anyone who got the message could come and security experts, police
officers and others were made welcome. Between 500 and 1,000 members of this
most improbable mix of people turned up from across Europe and the Americas.
Spotty youths from Nottingham, interested in swapping numbers and tales of
adolescent vandalism; slightly odd professional programmers; balding Dutch
hackers in their thirties and forties, more interested in international public
access data communications than online credit card fraud; corporate Americans in
smart casuals and official haircuts, on expenses; long-haired goths in black
leather, on grass.

    A hallmark of the event was the male-to-female ratio: running at roughly
100:1, it did not bode well for the demise of the anorak. Even so, there was
some evidence of the emergence of a hacker chic, with one of the few women
sporting jewellery made from watch parts and hair decoration courtesy of an
eviscerated floppy disk.

    Efforts were made to address this problem: there were lectures in social
engineering: ''the skill of manipulating people within bureaucracies'',
according to the congress programme. This started with the basic theory that to
get people's trust you had to smile and be pleasant and, if you were going to
lie, you had to be consistent.                                                                       PAGE   96
                        The Independent, August 13, 1993                        

    More advanced material was quoted from How to Win Friends and Influence
People. ''It was really teaching introverted hackers how to be normal human
beings and get themselves laid,'' an English attendee called John said
approvingly. Although English was the lingua franca, discussions blew up in
three or four languages at once - when you are arguing about Unix and Ethernet
it scarcely matters whether you are all speaking the same tongue.

    Names were optional. Once your 100 guilder ( pounds 36) entrance fee had
been paid, a computer took your picture and printed it out on a badge; no
further identification was required. There were two main strands to the event
and by rights neither should have worked.

    The technical side was a thing of wonder - a high-speed datalink to the
Internet ran into a catholic collection of elderly hardware in a barn. PCs, Macs
and Acorn Archimedes machines were linked to a vintage Sun workstation and
thence out to the ''Intertent'', the ''first local area network installed in a
field'' according to the organisers.

    Strands of telephone cables snaked from tent to tent, across trees and down
paths, providing those who had brought their own computers with a free Internet
connection. For some this was enough - one group of English hackers was content
to stay under canvas for the entire three days, communicating with their fellow
cyberpunks entirely through electronic mail.

    The random nature of the wiring and the unhealthy generator which powered
the whole exercise made this a haphazard affair; at times, only one call in five
could get through. If anything, the social side for those who left their tents
was even more unlikely. For once, the idea of a global community seemed to work:
litter was picked up, toilets cleaned and hands freely lent whenever the need
arose.

    There were about 120 computers on site, many of them exquisitely portable,
yet not one theft was reported. Dutch common sense and amiability pervaded the
event. Each day, four or five lectures, workshops or round-table discussions
took place, ranging from computer art and law to radio networks and using
digital telephone exchanges in inventive ways.

    The impromptu workshops were as interesting to many as the scheduled events.
Someone would sit down at a terminal and tap away for a few moments; a nugget of
information would attract a gaggle of hackers who would gather around,
scribbling in notebooks. Then they would break up and rush back to their tents,
eager to try out the latest discovery.

    One of the stars of the official show was Robert D Steele, ex-US Marine
officer and ex-CIA operative, who wandered around the site in a green Chairman
Mao cap with a Red Star badge.

    He turned up as part of his campaign to persuade the US Government to spend
a quarter of the CIA's budget on developing and supporting a public-access
database filled with as much encyclopedic information as possible. His thesis,
that the CIA does not know what data to gather and loses it anyway, was popular;
the surreal aspects of watching him give a talk with a flipchart to a marqueeful
of sundry hackers were heightened by the knowledge that he had given much the
same lecture to large US defence companies and been funded as a result.                                                                       PAGE   97
                        The Independent, August 13, 1993                        

    By bringing together the  computer underground  and mainstream, he
contended, there would be a valuable cross-fertilisation of ideas. ''But the CIA
are bastards!'' yelled one young Dutch hacker from the back of the room. ''Look
at the Bay of Pigs! If we take their money away and put them out of business
they'll hunt us down and kill us!'.

    This mixture of paranoia and idealism was reminiscent of the hippy Sixties,
as was the sharp anarchist commercialism that characterised the T-shirts,
magazines and stickers on sale next to the beer and Jolt double-caffinated cola.

    One T-shirt's design was the complete circuit diagram for a ''blue box'', an
illegal device for making free telephone calls, another proudly advertised a US
hacking group with their slogan ''Indict The Very Best!''. Grand ideas were in
the air along with the occasional puff of hash smoke and the chatter of
cellphone radio scanners.

    In UK such a motley bunch of travellers would be shown the gate before they
had unpacked their modems. Their image of themselves is of an international
elite, unbounded by borders or irksome local rules; when someone who would have
trouble getting served in a pub with a ''No Travellers'' sign can demonstrate
his home-made secure radio data network - every bit as good as commercial
products - it is hard not to see their point.

    Like the hardware hackers of the Seventies who built the first personal
computer, these new-age cyberpunks and digital crusties are pushing technology
into the public arena as hard as they can.

   You've probably never thought about how secure your computer systems are.
But if your office is like many, it is possible for even rookie "crackers"
(people who break into computer systems) to read electronic files, alter data or
destroy files altogether.  And they don't need high-tech equipment or
sophistication to do it.  Here are nine basic ways to protect yourself.

   1.  Lock and key. The most obvious but perhaps most dangerous cracker is
someone who physically walks into your office and leaves with a computer, a few
floppy disks or an external hard drive.  He or she has instant access to all the
information stored therein, and all the time in the world to find ways around
whatever security software you might have installed.

   Though it is easy to lock up computers, either by bolting them to the desk
or, preferably, using strong cables and metal locks, many offices neglect to do
so.  Keys should be accessible only to the system administrators or other people
who might need to move the machines.  The most critical computers can even be
wired to an alarm.

   Portable laptop and notebook computers are obviously easy targets -- but then
again, so is a briefcase.  Portable computers should never be left alone in
places where one wouldn't leave a briefcase.  As a precaution, users should be
trained to save their files on floppy disks rather than on the portables' hard
drives (if the files are not too big to fit on a floppy) -- that way, even if
the machine itself is stolen, the data is secure.

   Floppy disks should be locked in secure containers and kept out of sight.
Information that users have erased from floppy disks is easily recoverable using
a number of common software programs, so disks that are no longer being used
should be shredded or burned.  (Any written records and magnetic media that
contain security information should also be destroyed -- "dumpster diving" is a
popular method of gaining computer passwords and other security information.)
Any stolen hardware that is recovered should be checked thoroughly; the thief
could have both altered data files and modified programs to break security.  An
example: A former systems administrator at a large law firm says that on a
system he once recovered, he found a new program that would have recorded the
passwords of the users and sent them via modem to the cracker who set the
program up.

   2.  Be wary of outsiders. Just spending time in your office offers able
crackers opportunities to break into your system.  They can "shoulder surf"                                                                       PAGE   99
                  The Connecticut Law Tribune, August 9, 1993                   

passwords by furtively watching authorized users log on to the system, for
example, or peer through internal glass walls at users' keyboards.  (Determined
crackers will even try crawling through air ducts.)

   The lesson is: Don't let outsiders get a good look at your operations.  Try
to have in-house, trusted staff members perform as many computer-related
activities as possible.  If a system has to be sent out for service, remove all
its confidential files.  Obviously, you will need outsiders for certain tasks,
but choose consultants and service companies carefully.  If you hire temporary
employees and need to give them system access, delete their passwords as soon as
they are gone -- and ask full-time employees who worked with or near the temps
to change theirs.

   3.  Network cables can be trouble. Networks, with their multiple workstations
and tangle of wiring, create additional security problems.  A former systems
administrator at a large New York firm tells of a break-in in the mid-eighties:
During a check of the firm's systems, a computer staffer found a workstation in
the rafters that was hooked up to the network and was "snarfing all the [data]
and sending [it] to an outside number," the administrator recalls.  "Near as
they could tell, it had been there for at least six months." Fearing the loss of
their jobs, the administrator says, the information systems department decided
not to tell firm management about the leak; instead, they quietly dismantled the
workstation, and after that checked the systems regularly.

   Network cables that are hung from the ceiling -- the method of choice at many
firms -- can be easily tapped or disabled.  In a secure network, cables run
though shielded electrical pipes, and the hubs (places where wiring comes
together), file servers (large data storage drives), and modems -- the easiest
places for a network to be infiltrated -- are placed behind locked doors and are
checked regularly for signs of tampering.  Firms for whom security is
particularly important should consider using fiber optic cables, which are much
more difficult to tap than standard wiring (though they are at least twice as
expensive).

   4.  Modems are vulnerable. Network modems are particularly popular break-in
places; because they are designed to serve as gateways to outside users, they
are vulnerable to intruders.  It is essential to prevent unauthorized users from
logging on to the network from a remote location.  The best deterrent is a
callback modem.  With this, a user calls the network (via a modem on a portable
computer) and enters his or her login name and password.  The answering modem,
back at the office, then hangs up, finds the telephone number that corresponds
to the person's login name, and calls the user's computer back.  The system can
be modified by the system administrator for lawyers who are traveling so they
can call into the network from their hotel rooms.

   Finding the network's modem number is a good part of breaking into the
system, so experienced crackers will often dial all the numbers assigned to the
building or office, noting which ones are answered with a standard modem carrier
signal (a high-pitched long beep).  To short-circuit this infiltration method,
consider a silent modem, which does not signal that a connection has been made
until the login process has actually begun.  And for the highest security needs,
considering creating a "firewall" system -- one that looks and acts like the
system the cracker is trying to get into, but that contains no useful
information (Authorized users use special logins and commands to access the real
system.) Firewalls are expensive to build, but they are considered the most                                                                       PAGE  100
                  The Connecticut Law Tribune, August 9, 1993                   

reliable method of modem protection.

   5.  Eavesdroppers are out there. Every electronic machine, from a typewriter
to a computer screen, emits electromagnetic radiation.  Eavesdroppers, using
unsophisticated, homemade devices -- built for as little as $ 300 from parts
available at any electronics store -- can intercept and decipher signals from
computer monitors through walls and windows, from as far away as a van parked
across the street.  Vendors at computer security shows sometimes demonstrate
this by intercepting signals emanating from competitors' computers.

   In the 1950s the U.S. government established a program, called TEMPEST, to
develop standards for technology that would contain or suppress signal
emanations from electronic equipment to minimize the risk of eavesdropping.
(Those standards are classified.) TEMPEST equipment, which is manufactured by
about 50 companies -- including International Business Machines Corporation,
Digital Equipment Corporation and UNISYS Corporation -- can only be sold to
American companies for use in the United States, NATO signatory countries and a
few other friendly nations such as Canada and Australia.  TEMPEST products are
generally about 80 percent more expensive than their nonshielded relatives,
weigh more and take up more space.

   6.  Password protection. Most systems are set up so that doing almost
anything requires a password.  But a simple password can be cracked fairly
quickly, using computer programs that try all the most common passwords -- words
(in any language), names, numbers and simple variations of those, as well as a
couple of thousand common nonsensical words.  A good password contains both
letters and numbers and is long -- a three-character password can be broken by a
computer in less than an hour, while an eight-character password would take an
average of 45 years, even with a powerful computer.

   Avoid writing passwords down, especially on a desk or terminal, but if you
must, do not identify it as such or indicate what system it is for.  Passwords
should never be entered while others are watching, and should never be sent
anywhere via electronic mail. (One infamous cracker set up a system that scanned
an entire network's e-mail for the word "password," then copied those message to
a special file for later perusal.) Users should never share their passwords,
even with secretaries or other support staff.  And all users should change their
password regularly, whether they think they have been compromised or not.

   7.  Use encryption. Encryption programs -- with which original information is
transformed into what appears to be random, unintelligible character strings --
are another basic method for keeping data safe.  Using a special password or
"key," the user can reconstruct the original file in just a few seconds.  This
method is extremely effective: Even if computers, disks or hard drives are
stolen, the thief will probably not be able to figure out what is in the files.
There are a multitude of programs that will encrypt individual files, files
created with a particular program, entire hard drives and disks, or even entire
networks.  Encryption is particularly useful -- indeed, even necessary -- for
electronic mail, particularly when messages are being sent outside your own
office's e-mail system.

   8.  Beware of dangerous insiders. The most important security aspect of any
computer system is the people that are working on it.  According to Computer
Security Basics, published by O'Reilly & Associates, Inc., 80 percent of all
security break-ins are by fully authorized users who abuse their system                                                                       PAGE  101
                  The Connecticut Law Tribune, August 9, 1993                   

access.  A disgruntled employee may seek revenge by disrupting operations; a
gullible employee may be coerced into revealing passwords or data; an
unscrupulous employee may take bribes.  But the most dangerous insider is the
user who is untrained in security matters -- or who is too lazy to follow the
security rules.

   The best preventive measure is a well-trained computer staff, one that can
detect and head off security problems before they occur.  The system
administrator plays a big role in enforcing system security.  If that person is
inexperienced or improperly trained, he or she may leave holes in your security,
or may fail to recognize symptoms of breached security.

   The information systems director and firm management should set out a
computer security policy in writing, and every employee should read it and sign
a notice saying they understand it and agree to abide by it.  People who are
careless about locking up disks or protecting passwords should be reminded of
the firm's policy.  And users should have access only to the systems and files
they actually need.

   When an employee leaves the company, his or her access to the system should
be removed immediately; the employee should be reminded in an exit interview to
keep system security information confidential.

   9.  Plug your leaks aggressively. If a system is cracked, there are a few
steps that should be taken.  First, the leak should be plugged.  If the in-house
computer staff cannot figure out how it happened, the firm should hire an
outside security expert immediately.

   When the cracker is discovered, he or she should be prosecuted.  Several
federal laws prohibit cracking, and most states have also outlawed such acts.
According to  Computer Underground  Digest, most computer crime goes unreported
because companies are wary of admitting publicly that they have security
problems.

   Among the many consequences of the personal computer over the last dozen
years has been a staggering growth in computer crime, made easier by the
proliferation of terminals at home.

   Included in this category is illegal hacking -- using a computer and a
telephone line to break into remote mainframes for mischief or malfeasance,
usually the work of young men motivated by a desire to beat the system and show
that it can be done.

   From time to time, the  computer underground  has made it into the news, by
cracking into and wandering around the computers of NASA and NORAD or by setting
loose a computer virus that crippled the Internet, a network of computer
networks.

   More often, these computer capers have been played out less conspicuously,
though they have captured the continuing attention of law-enforcement agencies
around the world.

   Paul Mungo and Bryan Clough flesh out many details of computer crime and
computer criminals in "Approaching Zero," a book that argues that no electronic
information held by banks, universities or government agencies is safe.

   Mungo, a science writer, and Clough, a British expert on computer security
who advises New Scotland Yard, provide details of how various computer crimes
have been carried out and offer descriptions of the perpetrators.

   "That some young men find computing a substitute for sexual activity is
probably incontrovertible," the authors assert -- without any supporting
evidence.

   Despite such spicy claims, the book is somehow flat. It's not as if this is
the first time these stories have been told. Some are new but many are familiar,
and the overall effect is decidedly old hat.

   Although there are other hackers and new stories -- including much about
computer viruses in Bulgaria, of all places -- there does not seem to be enough
that's new to justify another book.

   To be sure, Mungo and Clough add interesting details and observations. They
argue that computer viruses were over-hyped for years before their threat became
as serious as the hypists would have you believe.

   They assert that this hyping was largely the work of people trying to sell
anti-virus software.

   But eventually, they concede, dire warnings about viruses came true. After
spending many pages deriding the prophets of doom, Mungo and Clough eventually
join the bandwagon.

   "As the world population of computer viruses grows exponentially," they say,
"so does the potential for real disaster. . . . A virus let loose in a hospital
computer could harm vital records and might result in patients receiving the
wrong dosages of medicine; workers could suffer job losses in virus-ravaged
businesses; dangerous emissions could be released from nuclear power plants if
the controlling computers were compromises and so on."

   They also make a factual error about public knowledge of computer viruses,
asserting that the first press report on the subject probably appeared in
February, 1987, in the magazine Computers & Security. In fact, Discover magazine
published a long report on computer viruses in November, 1984.

   Mungo and Clough have adopted an annoying practice of recounting long,
detailed stories of various computer crimes and then ending by saying that the
alleged victim of the alleged crime denies that it ever took place.

   For example, they say that the breakdown of the AT&T long-distance system in
January, 1990, could have been caused by a computer bomb planted in the system,
and they describe how that could have occurred.

   They note that AT&T had received a threat of a computer bomb a short time
before.

   But after telling the story, they say, "There is absolutely no proof that it
was a computer bomb, and AT&T's final, official explanation remains that the
shutdown was caused by an errant piece of software."

   Then there is a long story about two young hackers who used a complicated
scheme and a Swiss bank account to filch more than $130,000 from Citibank.

   After recounting this tale, the authors write, "You can believe this story or
not, as you wish. Certainly Citibank doesn't believe a word of it; it has
consistently denied that anything resembling the events described above have
ever happened. . . ."

   But you should never let the facts get in the way of a good story.                                                                       PAGE  107

            For more than a year, computer virus programs that can wreak havoc with
computer systems throughout the world were made available by a U.S. government
agency to anyone with a home computer and a modem, officials acknowledged this
week.

   At least 1,000 computer users called a Treasury Department telephone number,
spokesmen said, and had access to the virus codes by tapping into the Treasury's
Automated Information System bulletin board before it was muzzled last month.

   The bulletin board, run by a security branch of the Bureau of Public Debt in
Parkersburg, W. Va., is aimed at professionals whose job it is to combat such
malicious destroyers of computer files as "The Internet Worm," "Satan's Little
Helper" and "Dark Avenger's Mutation Engine." But nothing blocked anyone else
from gaining access to the information.

   Before the practice was challenged by anonymous whistle-blowers, the bulletin
board offered "recompilable disassembled virus source code" -- that is, programs
manipulated to reveal their inner workings. The board also made available
hundreds of "hackers' tools" -- the cybernetic equivalent of safecracking aids.

   They included "password cracker" software -- various programs that generate
huge volumes of letters and numbers until they find the combination that a
computer is programmed to recognize as authorizing access to its contents -- and
"war dialers," which call a vast array of telephone numbers and record those
hooked to a computer.

   The information was intended to educate computer security personnel,
according to Treasury spokesmen. "Until you understand how penetration is done,
you can't secure your system," said Kim Clancy, the bulletin board's operator.

   But with this information, relative amateurs could create new viruses,
according to software writers.

   "I am dismayed that this type of activity is being condoned by an American
governmental agency. I am extremely disturbed by the thought that my tax money
is being used for what I consider unethical, immoral and possibly illegal
activities," wrote an anonymous whistle-blower quoted in Risks Forum, a                                                                       PAGE  109

Silicon Valley-based electronic "magazine" where debate has raged on the issue
since it surfaced last month.

   "That's like leaving a loaded gun around and people saying: 'It's not my
fault if someone picks it up and shoots himself in the head with it,' " said
Paul Ferguson, a computer consultant upset by the Treasury Department's
practices.

   Treasury officials have little idea who has dialed up the bulletin board and
what has been copied out of it, spokesman Peter Hollenbach said. Hence it is
impossible to judge if any damage has been done.

   Hollenbach and some computer professionals minimize the risk, saying the
software on the bulletin board was acquired through the  computer underground 
in the first place, and thus has always been available to miscreants with
sufficient contacts, tenacity and skill.

   "Hackers don't go to the Department of Treasury to get their hacking tools,"
Clancy said.

   The Treasury Department became enmeshed in this controversy because it is one
of the most intense users of computers in the federal government. All the
billions of dollars of Treasury securities are handled, through the Bureau of
Public Debt, on computer networks, Hollenbach said.

   Attorney General Janet Reno urged U.S. attorneys Wednesday to crack down on
street violence, seeking maximum prison time for career criminals.

   "Many people estimate that 10 percent of the criminals commit 40 percent of
the crime," she told a U.S. Attorneys' National Conference.

   "We need to identify those 10 percent in your communities, those violent
career criminals, and working with local prosecutors ... (get) the longest
possible sentence that will be a sentence actually served.

   "If we can take them to federal court and get them off our streets, let's do
it in every possible way we can."

   She urged each of the U.S. attorneys from across the country to undertake
violent crime initiatives, appointing specialists or combining with other U.S.
attorneys in a region to carry out programs to get violent criminals off
streets.

   If local police or city prosecutors have taken an effective lead, follow them
and don't worry about who gets credit, she told the federal prosecuting
attorneys.

   "We need to develop a plan to use all of our resources," she said.

   Reno said prosecution of all other kinds of crime remained as important as
ever, listing everything from organized crime and drug smuggling to problems on
Indian reservations.

   She also said technology crime, including young  computer hackers  disrupting
major corporations for fun, will reshape U.S. attorneys' future case loads.

in Los Angeles that he used his hacking skills to rig radio call-in contests.
Meanwhile, a government appeal of a recent ruling in the espionage case is
pending in the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.

   U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Whyte denied Poulsen's motion to be released
on his own recognizance at a Friday bail hearing.

   The government two weeks ago appealed a ruling by Whyte suppressing evidence
taken in 1988 from computer tapes found in a Menlo Park storage locker rented by
Poulsen.  Whyte found police had conducted a warrantless search of the facility.

   A dispute over whether the suppression ruling knocked out a key espionage
charge was not resolved at Friday's hearing.  But Whyte said that it appeared
that the tape on which the spying charge was based has come from the storage
locker.  Poulsen's attorney, Paul Meltzer of Santa Cruz Meltzer & Leeming, said
that lose of the espionage charge has essentially gutted the government's case
against Poulsen.

   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Crowe has maintained that the crucial tape
containing classified Air Force information came from a subsequent search of
that he may seek a separate evidentiary hearing on the issue, if the government
appeal is unsuccessful.

    Should electronic bulletin boards -- either legitimate or underground -- be
allowed to post and disseminate virus source code?

    That question is generating heated debate, from the halls of Congress to the
deepest recesses of the hacker underground. It was touched off in May when an
anonymous message was posted on the Risks Digest, an electronic BBS in the
Silicon Valley.

    The author was upset that the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of
Public Debt Automated Information System (AIS) BBS, which carries
security-related information and is available to the general public, was posting
a broad range of virus source code. The writer also complained about Kim Clancy,
manager of AIS Security and an AIS BBS sysop.

    "I am extremely disturbed by the thought that my tax money is being used for
what I consider unethical, immoral, and possibly illegal activities," the
anonymous poster wrote.

    Clancy is a highly respected security administrator who has amassed a wealth
of sources in both the legitimate security community and the hacker underground.
As a result of her hacker contacts, groups like Phalcon/Skism have shared the
tricks of their trade and even helped to disinfect the AIS BBS when it was
invaded by a virus.
 
CEASE AND DESIST. After the anonymous message sparked an anti-virus protest,
Clancy's superiors directed her to remove all hacker files from the AIS BBS.
These included virus source code and information on how to break into computers,
networks, and PBXes. However, Clancy was not subjected to any disciplinary
action.

    "I was targeted by a self-elitist international group," Clancy said. "The
only thing they're hurting is the legitimate community of security
professionals."
 
BIG NEWS. The debate became very public when The Washington Post ran a
front-page article on June 19, 1993.

    Rep. Ed Markey, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and
Finance, then wrote to Lloyd Bentsen, secretary of the Department of the
Treasury, asking for "the rationale behind making such potentially harmful
information generally available."                                                                       PAGE  103
                           LAN Times, August 9, 1993                            

    Vesselin Vladimirov Bontchev, who heads the Virus Test Center of the
University of Hamburg, Germany, threw in his two cents: "I am Bulgarian, and my
country is known as the home of many productive virus writers," Bontchev said.
"But at least our government has never officially distributed viruses."

    As the debate raged on, everyone chose a side. Clancy and her supporters
believe that the public's right to know far outweighs the "slim" chance that
virus source code posted on a legitimate BBS will end up in the wrong hands. The
opposition is just as righteous, taking the position that writing, posting, or
disseminating any type of hacker files or virus source code should be outlawed.
 
OLDIES, BUT GOODIES. Experts say there are well over 2,000 viruses in existence
today. However, 90 percent of the damage is caused by the same five to 10
viruses. "Oldies," such as Jerusalem B and the Stoned virus, are still primary
sources of infection.

    A recent four-month online survey by the Computer Security BBS found that 64
percent of the respondents had experienced a computer virus attack in the past
12 months. Half of the infections were classified as minimal, but not everyone
escaped unscathed.

    Six percent of the virus victims reported losses of more than $ 100,000 and
said it took them more than three days to recover.

    While the number of viruses has increased, the technology behind viruses has
advanced very little.

    "Most of today's viruses are variations on the handful of originals or can
be traced to a virus-generation toolkit," said GarbageHeap (GHeap), a member of
the Phalcon/Skism group of virus writers and hackers that runs the 40Hex
underground virus BBS.

    According to GHeap, most of today's network administrators have effective
anti-virus procedures in place.

    "In the early days of viruses -- in the late 1980s and up until 1991 -- it
took network administrators a while to detect them and then disinfect their
networks," he said. "Nowadays, there's an anti-virus package out for almost
every virus you can think of."
 
PUBLIC SERVICE. As Clancy sees it, she was only performing a public service.

    "If BBSes like the Computer Security BBS and the AIS didn't post virus
source code or hacking programs, then only malicious hackers would have access
to them," she said. "The legitimate security professionals would be left out in
the cold."

    Clancy and other security BBS sysops contend that high-level hackers don't
need to access legitimate BBSes, since virus source code and hacking tools are
readily available in the hacker underground.

    "Some types of information may pose a risk if abused," said Jim Thomas, a
sociology professor at DeKalb Northern Illinois University who, along with
Gordon Meyers, runs the  Computer Underground  Digest, a BBS. "But in an open
democracy, the potential for abuse has been neither a necessary nor a                                                                       PAGE  104

sufficient justification to silence those with whom we disagree."

    Bill Strouse, president of Stoney River Networks, a Novell gold reseller in
Sunnyvale, Calif., agrees -- so strongly that he is taking up where Clancy and
the AIS BBS were forced to leave off.

    "We are going to move all of the virus-commented source-code files, such as
40Hex, onto the Ring of Fire BBS," Strouse said. "The anti-virus community can
pick on me all they want, but they can't censor me. I'm not doing anything
illegal, and I'm not government-owned and sponsored."

    Strouse, who heads up the Silicon Valley chapter of NetWare Users
International (NUI), runs the Ring of Fire BBS, which is devoted to NetWare and
legal issues.

    "The real irony behind all this hype about the AIS BBS was that the virus
code Clancy posted couldn't have been downloaded and used to infect networks,"
Strouse said. "She had removed the replication portion of the source code."

    Unlike the AIS BBS, Ring Of Fire is not wide-open to the public. Members of
any NUI branch get unlimited free access; nonmembers pay $ 25 per year for up to
90 minutes of access per day and unlimited downloads.

    To get into the Computer Security area of Ring of Fire, would-be users have
to specifically request access and have their identities, affiliations, and
telephone numbers verified by Strouse. Additionally, first-time callers get
access to only three public file areas and are limited to 20 minutes.

    "We have no intention of putting a loaded gun into the hands of an
unsuspecting user," Strouse said. "What we're doing is giving people the
diagrams and blueprints of virus code and hacker files so they have the
necessary tools and information to secure their networks."

    The Ring of Fire BBS number is (408) 739-8753; the ComSec BBS number is
(415) 495-4642.

                               December 21, 1993

   The number of reports of computer viruses increased again in November,
hitting a total of 92 cases, including three viruses reported for the first time
in Japan.

   The figure was 54 greater than that for last November, and the total for the
January-November period was by 550 cases from last year's 229, to a total of
779.

   According to a report released Dec. 20 by the Information-Technology
Promotion Agency (IPA), the number of different viruses reported in November was
19. Three of the viruses were reported for the first time in Japan.

   The most common infection routes were through floppy discs brought from
overseas, accounting for 45 percent of the cases. However, in about 46 percent
of the cases, the infection routes could not be determined.

   It is also important to properly secure hardware as well as floppy discs, the
IPA warned.

   The number of  computer virus  damage reports peaked in August and September
at 120 cases. Although virus reports declined to 81 in October, they increased
again in November.

   The IPA has received 1,103 reports of  computer virus  damage since April
1990, when the reporting system was established by the International Trade and
Industry Ministry.

   The Office of Thrift Supervision has sent out warnings to its member
institutions not to have unprotected data exchange with strangers --- one in
particular.

   The OTS was advised by the FBI that banks and thrifts in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Maryland, and Kentucky have recently received computer disks in the mail
from a person identifying himself as Master Fard Muhammed.

   When the institutions loaded the disks into their computers a powerful
 computer virus  infected all the systems connected to that local area computer
network.

   The virus, which authorities described as "not easily detectable by normal
screening programs" caused an unspecified amount of data on the institution's
computers to become unreadable.

   "Should any department in your institution receive one of these packages in
the mail, we recommend that the diskette not be inserted in any personal
computer and that the FBI be notified," John Robinson, OTS regional director
advised members.

   Authorities say they no idea what the motive for the prank may be, but in the
past couple of years both Federal and state authorities have passed strict laws
against what some term high-tech terrorism.

    While businesses and executives are increasingly dependent on computers,
computer criminals have become increasingly more sophisticated.

   Viruses, computer hackers, stolen equipment, tampering with data, illegal
data transfer and desktop forgery are just a few of the computer-related crimes
that have emerged in the high-tech age, said Wendi Harvey of the Council of
Better Business Bureaus, based in Arlington, Va.

   While computer theft has grown, so have non-property related crimes such as
designing software "viruses" that crash systems and the illegal use of data
bases by computer hackers. Other common crimes involve employees or repair
technicians tampering with data and theft by data transfer and desktop forgery.

   Computer theft and fraud might seem like problems that apply only to
businesses, but many of those businesses pass the costs on to consumers as
higher prices for their goods and services. So many firms now have policies and
security programs to protect their computer systems.

   International Business Machines Corp.'s research and development laboratory
in Boca Raton, Fla., has installed anti-virus computer software and it
periodically checks them for viruses, said Alan Macher, IBM spokesman.

   In November of 1989, two employees at IBM in Boca Raton stole computer parts
worth $ 1.8 million, one of the biggest thefts in the company's history. They
were arrested when they tried to sell the stolen chips in Florida.

   Boca Research Inc., a computer modem manufacturer in Boca Raton, has had
problems with the  computer virus  Michelangelo.

   A  computer virus  lies dormant until something triggers it, such as a date
on the computer clock. Then the virus can wipe out all the computer's data.
Michelangelo was activated on the artist's birthdate, March 6, in 1992.

   Gail Blackburn, Boca Research's company spokeswoman, said she lost all her
data when the virus invaded her computer. Since then, the company has installed
anti-virus software, said Larry Steffann, vice- president of planning and
development.

   The company also does not permit employees to bring their own software to
work. A lot of viruses are spread through personnel software that employees
install on their business machines.                                                                       PAGE   38

   IBM (Yorktown Heights, N.Y.) said last week it is now shipping an enhanced
version of its IBM AntiVirus products, including protection for Novell NetWare
LAN servers.

   IBM AntiVirus version 1.04 provides comprehensive "install-and-forget"
automatic protection against  computer virus  attacks in DOS, Windows, OS/2 and
Novell NetWare computing environments.

   IBM AntiVirus for NetWare uses the same state-of-the-art detection technology
used throughout IBM AntiVirus products.  It detects well over 2,000 known
viruses as well as many viruses that have yet to be written, while virtually
eliminating the false alarms that plague many other anti-virus products.

   Real-time scanning enables the LAN server to protect itself immediately if a
virus on a client PC is found trying to infect the LAN server. LAN
administrators also can scan selected volumes on demand, or schedule a scan for
particular times on selected days. If a virus is found, customized messages can
be sent to the affected user and administrators, and any infected files can be
locked to prevent the infection from spreading.  IBM AntiVirus for NetWare is
designed to have minimal impact on LAN server performance.  Its automatic
priority adjustment keeps the additional load to less than four percent for
typical servers.  Single copies of IBM AntiVirus for DOS, Windows and OS/2
systems are available for $29.95 by calling (800) 551-3579.

   THERE have been 9,181 computer "disasters" in Britain over the past three
years, according to the Survive! club of computer managers specialising in
disaster recovery. A disaster is defined as inability to use a computer causing
at least L10,000 of corporate damage, but excluding fraud. The largest
individual case was the spectacular public fiasco of the Stock Exchange's Taurus
system, which was aborted after years of fruitless work. That caused a loss of
up to L400m, according to Survive! calculations. The biggest category of loss
was theft, accounting for 37pc of cases. The stealing of desk-top computers is
"reaching epidemic proportions". Almost 21pc of the cases were caused by
viruses, though other recent reports have said most of these attacks were
relatively benign and did not cause major damage. But Survive! reckons there is
each year a 6pc chance of an organisation catching a  computer virus,  with the
recovery costing between L10,000 and L250,000. The Institution of Analysts &
Programmers reckons the virus danger is grossly exaggerated but half its members
have at some stage encountered one. Most of the damage was done by just nine
viruses, the commonest being one called Form. According to Survive! malicious
damage accounted for nearly 9pc of the disasters it found. Many of these were in
the form of "time bombs"-hidden program routine that causes damage to data at a
pre-set time-and there are over 100 prosecutions pending. But there were also
some terrorist bombs. After that, in descending order, came hardware faults,
hacking, environment (power problems, air conditioning failure), software
(Taurus comes into this category), and communications. Human error, negligence,
natural disasters, water damage from cracked pipes and the like, and fire caused
under 41/2pc of the instances between them. Statistics are notoriously
mendacious but soon it will be possible to compare these figures with ones
produced by the government. A national survey of 10,000 companies aims to
identify the extent of computer security breaches over the past two years and
the effect on business. Its findings are expected in early 1994. The survey will
also invite organisations which have been hit to tell the rest of the world. A
similar survey of computer security in 1991 found more than half of businesses
had suffered from security problems, at a cost of Ll.1 billion a year. THE Data
Protection Registrar has explained his view of the meaning of particular phrases
used in enforcement notices, in particular about "residence", "family
membership" and "name matching". The rules do not allow the extraction of
personal information simply by reference to current or previous address. They
also prevent the inclusion of information about any other individual who lives
or has lived at the same address as the subject of the search.

    CAN a  computer virus  change its spots? Yes, say computer security experts.

    Specialists have warned that a new breed of sophisticated  computer virus 
that changes itself into multiple versions is becoming more common and that it
can outwit some anti-virus software.

    Known as polymorphic viruses, they are designed to hide from popular
anti-virus programs by changing themselves slightly each time they replicate.

    Businesses relying on older versions of anti-virus scanning software risk
leaving their PCs open to infection from polymorphic viruses.

    These can produce as many as 2.3 trillion versions of themselves, making
them impossible to detect without the help of a new generation of anti-virus
software.

    "There is no question about it, polymorphic viruses are definitely the wave
of the future," said Phil Talsky, product manager at leading US anti-virus
software developer McAfee Associates.

    Mr Talsky added that the most common polymorphic virus is the Satan Bug.

    "It recently entered our top 10 list of most often reported viruses, at
number nine," he said.

    David Stang, head of US- based Norman Data Defence Systems and founder of
the International Computer Security Association, agreed that the Satan Bug posed
a security challenge.

    He said: "We are hearing more reports daily of Satan Bug infections and it
is a major problem for some organisations."

    The Satan Bug has turned up at some US Government agencies. These include
the Social Security Administration and the Army Corp of Engineers. There have
also been reports that it had been detected in Europe, and that Tremors, another
virus, is affecting PC users in Germany.

    However, they should not panic, Mr Stang said.                                                                       PAGE    3

                   South China Morning Post, February 1, 1994

    "Becoming infected by any kind of virus is rare and coming across the Satan
Bug is even rarer," he said.

    The Satan Bug is not designed to erase data, but it interferes with users
trying to connect to a local area network and will change file dates.

    It replicates quickly and can travel across a local area network to infect
other users.

     Computer virus  experts at IBM said polymorphic viruses should not trouble
most users.

    "If users take proper precautions, polymorphic viruses are easy to deal
with," said Steve White, manager of the high integrity computing laboratory at
the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Centre.

    "We have not found a very high infection rate among users by the Satan Bug
and the whole issue of polymorphic viruses has received more attention than it
deserves," he said.

    Mr White and his colleagues at IBM have completed several detailed studies
of how  computer virus  infections propagate. They were the first to label the
Michelangelo virus scare two years ago as over-blown.

    He pointed out that PC users faced about the same chance of a virus
infection as they did of a hard disc failure, so proper back-up procedures
should be routine.

    To eliminate a virus, users must detect and often erase infected files and
then reinstall them from an uninfected backup disk.

    This can take several hours for each PC infected. The US Army Corps of
Engineers estimates that it lost more than $ 12,000 per hour in trying to
exorcise the Satan Bug.

    McAfee's latest version of its ViruScan software can detect Satan Bug, but
users must delete all infected files.

    While Mr Stang said he developed an anti-virus program that could detect and
erase the Satan Bug without requiring users to reinstall infected files, Mr
Talsy said polymorphic viruses were more difficult to detect since they used
encryption to hide from scanning software.

    Researchers at IBM are working on an automatic system to detect and analyse
new polymorphic viruses.

    While  computer virus  experts concede that polymorphic viruses are written
by talented programmers, the developer of the Satan Bug is believed to be a 16-
year-old computer enthusiast who uses the pseudonym Hacker Life. There is no US
law prohibiting the writing of a virus program.

    Advancing computer technology could help solve this growing problem.

    Western Digital, a US company making hard discs, has developed a chip, the
Immuniser, designed to monitor system activity and to block any suspicious                                                                       PAGE    4
                   South China Morning Post, February 1, 1994                   

writing to the hard disc. The chip works only with certain newer PCs.

    Mr Talsky warned that more polymorphic viruses were on the way.

    While the risk from a PC virus infection is small, there are important
safeguards all PC users should adopt. These include using the latest anti-virus
software.

    "We produce new versions of ViruScan every six weeks," said Talsky.

    "But there are a lot of people using older versions and they will not get
the full protection."

    Any anti-virus software version written before August 1993, is unlikely to
offer protection against polymorphic viruses. Users should update their
software.

    Mr Stang recommended that users with many PCs should decide on a computer
security strategy.

    "Some users apply the same security to all their systems. The problem with
this approach is that some systems should be better protected while others may
not need quite so much protection," he said.

    A new virus called "Satanbug" is reported to be spreading rapidly in the
United States. The international virus watchdog publication, "Virus Bulletin,"
of Abingdon, England, said Satanbug is just one of several new viruses infecting
the nation's  computers. 

     Virus  Bulletin said that it is costly for a number of U.S. companies,
including Rockwell International, which recently revealed that it spent more
than $ 44,000 to recover from an infection in April. The company told the
publication that the incident was just one of more that 1,000 virus attacks it
has dealt with since 1988.


   Virus Bulletin said tests conducted at its offices in England indicate that
companies such as Rockwell and even individuals are not as well armed against
virus attacks as first thought.

   In what the publication called a "shock," it discovered in a text of six
leading anti-virus software products that all but one of the manufacturers are
not updating the memory-resident portion of their products. According to the
publication, despite the products' claims of being able to catch all-known
viruses, many of the programs are allowing a large number of viruses to go
undetected.

   Anti-virus software usually consists of multiple components, including a
scanner. The scanner typically runs each time a computer is turned on and scans
memory, DOS and program files on a hard drive looking for viruses that have
already infected a system. The program works to keep viruses from entering a
system in the first place by staying in the computer's memory, watching for
viruses trying to gain entrance.

   Richard Ford, editor of Virus Bulletin, speculated as to why companies would
make claims for complete detection when portions of their programs actually did
not have the capability. "This difference may have been lost along the way
between the technical people and the marketing people at the company," he said.
"People might think twice if they knew."

   According to Virus Bulletin tests, one company that claimed the industry's
high level of virus detection was able to detect only 78.8 percent of the
viruses tested against it.

   The publication said two programs that showed good marks in the test were RG
Software's Vi-Spy, which had a perfect score, and Dr. Solomon's Toolkit and                                                                       PAGE   55

Guard, which missed just a few.

   Ford said the disparity between the products' claims and actual performance
is causing anger among users.

   "We transmit and receive electronic data to and from our clients every day,"
said David Merrill, vice president of a Manhattan executive search firm.  "If I
can't rely on my program to keep viruses out, I run the risk of infecting a
dozen or so clients before my scanner tells me I have a problem the next day.
I'm supposed to feel good about that type of protection? Who's writing
anti-virus software -- Beavis and Butt-head?"

   Charlie Atterbury, coordinator of micro computer security at a major company
that operates 35,000 PCs, said: "I'm disappointed in some of the software
vendors. They're taking the easy way out so they can use the marketing hype that
'my virus program takes less memory than the other guy's,' and the real reason
is that they are not doing the job. I have to wonder what they are thinking."

   Phil Talsky, a spokesman for McAfee Associates, apparently does not share the
same concerns as the users, according to Virus Bulletin. He said the disparity
is "not a problem" as long as users always run their scanner. He felt the
publication's revelations are a "non-event."

   Ray Glath, president of RG Software, Scottsdale, Ariz., developer of Vi-Spy,
said, "Others have left holes because they can't pack as much virus detection in
their TSR as they have in their scanner without bumping up against DOS' 640k
memory barrier."

   He said that forces some developers to make arbitrary decisions regarding
which virus to leave their customers unprotected against. He added, "You hear of
many situations where companies keep getting reinfected after they think they've
cleaned up from a virus attack."

   Virus Bulletin has been recognized as the foremost international publication
on  computer virus  protection, detection and removal since 1989.


   What is a  Computer Virus? 

   A "virus" is a program that someone makes just to cause trouble. It's called
a virus because it makes a computer "sick," the way a virus makes a person sick.

   People design a  computer virus  to change bits of information in a program -
or even wipe out a computer's memory. It does this by getting into the
computer's operating system - the part that controls how it works.

   Once inside, the virus program makes copies of itself. Then the virus can
spread and "infect" other computers in the system. Most new computers, though,
check every program to see if it contains a virus.                                                                                 
   A  computer virus  won't make you sneeze and cough. But if you find that all
your computer files have mysteriously disappeared, it might make you feel sick!

   With its acquisition of Brightworks Development, McAfee Associates Inc
embarks on a new era that will launch it into the emerging market for network
software and continue its strong earnings growth.

   "We are entering a second stage of development," chief executive William

revenue. But our intent is to grow the top line and the bottom line."

   Tuesday, the company reported a 31 percent revenue increase and a 15 percent
net income rise, 1993 over 1992.

   Since 1986, Brightworks has developed and sold network management software,
making it a prime conduit through which to sell McAfee's anti-virus programs to
network managers.

   McAfee owns about 67 percent of the anti-virus market, versus 14 percent for
its major competitor, the Peter Norton division of Symantec Corp <SYMC.O>,
Larson said.

   Larson attributes McAffee's success to selling directly to large corporate
customers like Ford Motor Co <F.N> and to government agencies, via electronic
distribution.

   Norton targets retail customers through traditional computer reseller
channels, Larson said.

   Larson said Norton is also targeting the area of network management in which
to expand.

   "Battle lines (for the market) are just now being drawn," Larson said. He
added that, of the roughly 100 million personal computers worldwide, 30 million
are linked to local area networks and only four percent of those utilize network
management tools. International Data Corp forecasts that will grow to 14 percent
by the end of 1994, according to Larson.

   "Brightworks has one of the biggest shares of the (network tools) market, an
award winning product list and a robust direct tele-sales operation," Larson
said.                                                                       PAGE   10

   Among its products, Brightworks sells SiteMeter, software that monitors the
number of times a software package is utilized on a network, and Network Remote,
a diagnostics tool.
     To manage its entry, McAfee has hired Bob Chappelear, who
ran the Peter Norton division of Symantec, Larson said.
     McAfee also is bringing on board Brightworks head Greg
Gianforte and few, if any, staff cuts will take place.
    "The prime assets of the company are with the people,"
Larson said. Although he declined to price the deal, payment
will be all cash -- no stock sales or new loans.

   "We have $ 28 million in cash and all the money is coming from (that),"
Larson said.

   Larson said McAfee has money to look for other companies.

   "We don't want to get too far ahead, but we certainly have the financial
resources to continue to pursue (other acquisitions)," he said.

   But company management is intent on not losing focus on its core business of
selling anti-virus software for single-user  computers. Virus  complexity is
ever increasing and the number of viruses infecting computers doubles every
year, Larson said.

   Larson said Brightworks, with its established telephone and direct sales
network, will help McAfee begin competing head-to-head with Peter Norton for
retail anti-virus business.

  As many readers know, a  computer virus  is pure misery for the home user.
But it is even more devastating for a business. And the problem isn't going
away.

   For example, computer viruses have been spreading on networks. This means
that every PC connected to an infected network is, in turn, in danger of being
infected.

   But peace of mind is available, according to Cheyenne Software Inc. of Roslyn
Heights, a local area network software developer. The company has a product
called "InocuLAN" that it claims will protect an entire computer system from a
potentially devastating  computer virus. 

   "Traditionally, password protection and a 'locked door' were enough to
prevent unauthorized access to data," said Andrew Boyland, director of computer
security products for Cheyenne Software. "But the most serious and potentially
damaging security threat to hit LANs in recent years has been the  computer 
 virus. "

   He said a study commissioned by the National Computer Securities Association
and Dataquest in 1991 revealed that 63 percent of 600 companies responding had
had an encounter with a  computer virus. 

   Boyland noted that the virus problem, in general, has been getting worse over
the past five years and said that the number of viruses "is roughly growing at
the rate of 2 1/2 per day." He said he expected the rate to continue but pointed
out that "there are new viruses that are constantly being written that are more
complex than the old ones."

   Years ago, a  computer virus  traveled from one floppy disk to another,
making recovery time shorter and less expensive, according to Boyland.

   He referred to InocuLAN as a "computer drug" that prevents a killer virus
from invading a business network system.

   Once a virus damages a computer system, it can be costly and time consuming
to return it to a previrus environment, according to Boyland. But "InocuLAN
protects both your file server and DOS work stations against viruses," he said.

   Boyland said that there are roughly 2,000 viruses "in the world out there"
and that about 100 of them are considered fairly prevalent. He said the                                                                       PAGE    8

general description of a virus writer "is a 17-year-old in high school or
college. They begin tinkering with computers at generally a young age, and they
decide that this is kind of a neat way to fool everybody.

   "The hacking community is a very powerful one," Boyland said. "They share
information with each other through what we call pirating bulletin boards, or
bulletin boards where they exchange virus codes, information on how to break
into the systems, weakness and insecurities in particular systems. Then they set
out to attempt a virus.

   "Most of the viruses that we have seen have clearly been written by people
with lots of computer experience," Boyland said. "They move fast, they're hard
to detect, and they are cleverly written. The poor viruses, the ones that are
not well written, are the ones that we commonly see and hear about for a month
or two."

   According to Boyland, a graduate of the State University at Binghamton and
the University of Copenhagen, a virus can spread with great speed. He said a
company in France recently had 4,000 PCs infected within three hours after a
virus entered the network.

   Boyland said that situations like Michelangelo became bad virus incidences
because by accident "somebody shipped out copies of their software with copies
of the Michelangelo virus on it, so it was caused to spread that much faster."

   He said users can call Cheyenne Software at (800) 243-9462 for information on
disaster recovery, network back-up and anti-virus or network monitoring.

    Can a  computer virus  change its spots? Yes, say computer security experts,
who warn that a new breed of sophisticated  computer virus  that changes itself
into multiple versions is becoming more common and that it can outwit some
anti-virus software.

    Known as polymorphic viruses, they are designed to hide from popular
anti-virus programs by changing themselves slightly each time they replicate.

    Businesses relying on older versions of anti-virus scanning software risk
leaving their PCs open to infection from polymorphic viruses. Such viruses can
produce as many as 2.3 trillion versions of themselves, making them impossible
to detect without the help of a new generation of anti-virus software.

    'There is no question about it, polymorphic viruses are definitely the wave
of the future,' says Phil Talsky, product manager at leading US anti-virus
software developer McAfee Associates. Talsky adds that the most common
polymorphic virus is the Satan Bug and it is infecting increasing numbers of PC
users. 'It recently entered our top 10 list of most often reported viruses, at
number nine.'

    David Stang, head of US-based Norman Data Defense Systems and founder of the
International Computer Security Association, agrees that the Satan Bug poses a
computer security challenge. 'We are hearing more reports daily of Satan Bug
infections and it is a major problem for some organisations.'

    The Satan Bug has turned up at some US government agencies where it has
infected several hundred PC systems. These include the Social Security
Administration and the Army Corp of Engineers. There have also been reports that
the Satan Bug has been found in European PC systems, and that Tremors, another
polymorphic virus, is affecting PC users in Germany.

    However, they should not panic, Stang says. 'Becoming infected by any kind
of virus is rare and coming across the Satan Bug is even rarer. But if you are
unlucky enough to get infected, it is going to be expensive.'

    The Satan Bug is not designed to erase data like some viruses, such as
Michelangelo, but it interferes with users trying to connect to a local area
network and will change file dates. It replicates quickly and can travel across
a local area network to infect other users.                                                                       PAGE   12

                       Financial Times, January 25, 1994

     Computer virus  experts at IBM say polymorphic viruses should not trouble
most users. 'If users take proper precautions, polymorphic viruses are easy to
deal with,' says Steve White, manager of the high integrity computing laboratory
at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. 'We have not found a very high
infection rate among users by the Satan Bug and the whole issue of polymorphic
viruses has received more attention than it deserves.'

    White and his colleagues at IBM have completed several detailed studies of
how  computer virus  infections propagate. They were the first to label the
Michelangelo virus scare two years ago as overblown and correctly predicted that
it would not cause much damage.

    White points out that PC users face about the same chance of a virus
infection as they do of a hard disc failure, so proper backup procedures should
be a routine task. To eliminate a virus, users must detect and often erase
infected files and then reinstall them from an uninfected backup disk.

    This can take several hours for each PC infected. The US Army Corps of
Engineers estimates that it lost more than Dollars 12,000 per hour in trying to
exorcise the Satan Bug.

    McAfee's latest version of its ViruScan software can detect Satan Bug, but
users must delete all infected files.

    While Stang says he has developed an anti-virus program that can detect and
erase the Satan Bug without requiring users to reinstall infected files, Talsky
says polymorphic viruses are more difficult to guard against since they use
encryption to hide from virus scanning software. 'Polymorphic viruses are
algorithm-based so we have to essentially crack their code first and produce
algorithms to counter them. Normally, it takes our programmers one hour to
modify our software to detect a regular virus, but with a polymorphic virus, it
can take us 48 hours to develop software that can detect it.'

    Researchers at IBM say they are working on an automatic system to detect and
analyse new polymorphic viruses. This will enable a faster response in producing
updates of anti-virus software and help slow their spread.

    While  computer virus  experts concede that polymorphic viruses are written
by very talented programmers, the developer of the Satan Bug is believed to be a
16-year-old computer enthusiast who uses the pseudonym Hacker4Life. There is no
US law prohibiting the writing of a virus program and programmers often post
their latest virus creation quite openly on local computer bulletin board
systems. There are about 2,500 known PC viruses.

    Advancing computer technology could help solve this growing problem. Western
Digital, a US company making hard discs, has developed a chip, the Immunizer,
designed to monitor system activity and to block any suspicious writing to the
hard disc. However, the chip works only with certain newer PCs.

    On the software side, companies are developing different types of anti-virus
programs that, like the Immunizer chip, monitor what is happening within the PC.
If the software detects suspicious activity, it blocks it and flags an alert.

    Talsky warns that more polymorphic viruses are coming.                                                                       PAGE   13

                       Financial Times, January 25, 1994

    While the risk from a PC virus infection is small, there are important
safeguards all PC users should adopt. These include using the latest anti-virus
software. 'We produce new versions of ViruScan every six weeks,' says Talsky.
'But there are a lot of people using older versions and they won't get the full
protection.' Any anti-virus software version written before August 1993 is
unlikely to offer protection against polymorphic viruses. Users should contact
their vendor and update their software.

    All new software, no matter what its source, must be scanned for viruses.
'Most people avoid computer bulletin boards and shareware software, thinking
that they might be infected. But most of our calls are from users that have been
infected from commercial software, especially demo software disks,' says Talsky.

    Stang recommends that users with many PCs decide on a computer security
strategy. 'Some users apply the same security to all their systems. The problem
with this approach is that some systems should be better protected while others
may not need quite so much protection. If you tell each user that they must
spend five to 10 minutes each day scanning for viruses, that translates into a
huge cost in terms of staff time over the course of a year. That can turn out to
be more expensive than dealing with a virus infection.'

   There were a total of 897 reported cases of damage to computers because of
viruses in 1993, an increase of 154 percent over the 253 confirmed cases in the
preceding year, the Information Technology Promotion Agency, Japan, (IPA)
reported Jan. 21.

   The 1993 total represented 73 percent of the total number of cases confirmed
by the IPA from April 1990 to December 1993.

   The sharp increase in 1993 was attributed to a rise in the number of viruses
and an increase in computer users' awareness of the  computer virus  reporting
system.

   The IPA has been monitoring computer viruses in Japan since April 1990 under
the auspices of the International Trade and Industry Ministry.

   As of the end of 1993, 71 different computer viruses had been reported,
including 66 that invade computers running MS-DOS, and five that infect
Macintosh computers.

   Twenty-one new viruses were detected for the first time by the IPA in 1993.

   Of the cases reported in 1993, 359 were reported by corporations, 246 by the
information industry, 238 by individuals, and 54 by schools and research
institutes.

   The Kanto region had the most cases at 499, followed by Kinki at 128, Chubu
at 115, Tohoku and Kyushu at 41 each. There were 37 cases in Chugoku and 19 in
Hokkaido.

    COMPUTER experts have warned the public of a fresh  computer virus  threat
affecting compact discs used to store vast catalogues of data.

    The discs, known as CD-Roms compact disc read only memories , are an
increasingly popular format for those who need to carry or archive large amounts
of information.

    One CD-Rom, resembling the more well-known shiny music platters, can replace
an entire encyclopaedia, or carry detailed graphical and textual information on
every painting in an art gallery's collection. Often the discs cost several
thousand pounds.

    But the data on a CD-Rom is designed only to be read, not altered. So a
CD-Rom with a virus on it cannot be cleaned up in the same way as programs held
on floppy disk. Richard Ford, editor of Virus Bulletin, said yesterday: ''The
only use for an infected CD-Rom is as a frisbee.''

    The problem is that a virus on a CD-Rom can spread to the computer system
that reads it. Transmission can occur via small functional programs, such as
routines that will speed up access to the information, included on the disc in
addition to the bulk data itself.

    During December, virus specialists heard of four separate reports of
infected CD-Roms. They fear this is the start of a growing trend and are warning
computer users to scan new CD-Roms for viruses just as they would ordinary
software arriving on a floppy disk. Scanning will be a time-consuming process
since CD-Roms hold huge amounts of data in hundreds of compressed files.

    Computer viruses can cause relatively mild effects, such as messages flashed
up on screen, or potential disasters if the rogue code disrupts or erases
valuable data. The cases reported last month occured on discs carrying so-called
''shareware'', software that people try out before handing over a fee to its
author.

    Among computer hobbyists, shareware is a popular way of testing new computer
programs. The difficulty is that shareware is often second-hand, copied and
collated from electronic message centres, called bulletin-boards, which are
renowned sources of virus infection. Mr Ford said: ''The larger reference discs
produced by reputable companies are fairly reliable but it doesn't really matter
where a CD-Rom comes from; it should always be checked.'' He added:                                                                       PAGE   28

                        The Independent, January 3, 1994

''Shareware discs are very risky indeed. I would advise people not to use these
CD-Roms on machines that hold critical data.''

    The reported infections include two shareware collections. The first is
called Software Vault collection 2, published by the American Databank Corp,
which was infected with a virus activated every day between 9am and 10am. This
requires the user to enter the answer to a simple mathematical problem before
they can use their computer.

    The second is called Night Owl 10, infected with a relatively harmless virus
called ''Lapse''. The manufacturers of both discs admit the infections and are
expected to withdraw the CD-Roms.

    In 1986, the Brain virus emerged from its creator in Pakistan and spread on
pirated copies of Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect. Brain, the first full-fledged
 computer virus,  replaced the contents of a PC's disk-boot sector with virus
code and labeled three clusters as bad in the file allocation table.

    As IS managers plan for a new year, there are more than 2,000 viruses
capable of dashing those plans by doing everything from erasing a hard disk to
altering their own signatures with each replication. As viruses evolve,
anti-virus software is also changing to keep its footing on this treacherous
landscape.

    "We used to detect a virus by matching its signature against the actual
virus, matching its code.  Now programmers are writing viruses so that every
time they infect a program, the virus changes its fingerprint so it can't be
found by conventional means," said Bob Janacek, technical director for security
products at Safetynet Inc., the Millburn, N.J., maker of Virus Net Pro. Virus
Net Pro and other packages now use heuristics and algorithms to treat these
polymorphic viruses.

    Tremor, a polymorphic virus created with a mutation engine, can have more
than 2 billion iterations, said Phil Talsky, product manager for ViruScan
anti-virus software, from McAfee Associates Inc., in Santa Clara, Calif.
Algorithms with complex mathematical procedures are now required to detect such
iterations, Talsky said.

    Also changing the virus outlook are anti-virus development kits, available
on underground bulletin boards. "The virus construction kits make it much easier
for less skilled people to write viruses that are more clever and deadly," said
Tory Case, product marketing manager for Central Point Software Inc., in
Beaverton, Ore. "I'm not a programmer, but with the Virus Creation Laboratory by
hacker Nowhere Man,' I could create a virus simply by using pull-down menus and
click-and-choose options."

    Signature scans fall short

    As a result, most anti-virus software developers have changed their
approach; in addition to detecting known viruses, they screen for viruslike
behaviors. "With the exponential growth of viruses, there is absolutely no way
to always have a signature database that includes all known viruses," said                                                                       PAGE   30

Brian Sevy, product manager for Intel Corp.'s network management operations, in
American Fork, Utah.

    With its LAN Desk Virus Protect software, for example, Intel provides both a
signature database and rules-based technology. These rules look for behavior
that is characteristic of viruses, such as COM file growth.

    This new emphasis on behavior-blocking techniques is bolstered by a study
conducted by two captains at the Air Force Institute of Technology, in Huber
Heights, Ohio. The study tested the effectiveness of anti-virus packages against
both well-known viruses and those found on underground bulletin boards.

    "The Air Force is a big consumer of computer software. Our goal was to get
the virus protection that is the most effective," said Capt. Kevin Ziese,
co-author of a report based on the study. "Instead of trying to keep up with the
newest virus in town, you should monitor for virus behaviors."

    Ziese found that two software packages -- Central Point Anti-Virus and the
anti-virus utility in Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOS 6.0 -- caught 100 percent of the
viruses used in the study. Both products employ behavior blocking as well as
signature scanning.

    The most dreaded threat to an anti-virus software developer is a virus that
attacks the anti-virus package itself.

    " An anti-virus scanner can end up spreading a virus if it's a direct
attack," said Frank Horwitz, president of Reflex Inc., the Brier, Wash., maker
of Disknet anti-virus software. Tremor, for example, attacked the TSR
(terminate-and-stay-resident) component of Central Point Anti-Virus; Central
Point addressed this by adding detection for Tremor and altering the TSR in
Version 2.0, which was released in May.

   Damage caused to computer programs by harmful viruses more than tripled in
Japan in 1993, and is expected to total about 900 cases by the year-end, a
government-affiliated organization reported Wednesday.

   The Information-Technology Promotion Agency, Japan (IPA), affiliated with the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, attributed the spread of viruses
to growing sales of low-end machines compatible with those produced by U.S.
computer giant International Business Machines Corp. (IBM).

   Agency officials said a growing number of harmful programs produced overseas
have been imported to Japan.

   Viruses are computer programs which spread through floppy disks and other
means and destroy healthy programs stored in computer systems.

   The agency said there were only 14 cases of virus infection in 1990 when it
began to take statistics on the trouble, but the number increased to 57 in 1991
and to 253 in 1992.

   By the end of November this year, 779 cases had been reported to the agency.

   Since a large number of virus infections are usually reported at around
Christmas, the total number by the year-end is sure to hit 900, the agency said.

   The most common virus in Japan is called a 'cascade' which caused information
to run down on the screen like a waterfall, the agency said.

    A year-old computer network has become the communications backbone of
Germany's neo-Nazi scene, with users sharing ideas on how to rid Germany of
foreigners, coordinate illegal rallies and swap bomb-making recipes.

   The "Thule Network," guarded by passwords and loyalty tests, consists of at
least a dozen bulletin boards in three western states, according to law
enforcement officials and computer experts. It is used by extreme rightists to
avoid detection by police unfamiliar with new computer technology.

   The network computers call one another nightly and exchange files. Important
information - such as contact numbers for transportation on the eve of a big
rally - can be disseminated in a few hours and without a paper trail.

   The network's name derives from the small, elite 1920s movement considered
the Nazi vanguard. Thule movement leaders included Hitler henchman Rudolf Hess,
whose Aug. 14 birthday is marked annually by today's neo-Nazis.

   With the network's aid, some 500 neo-Nazis formed a convoy that drove into
the city of Fulda and rallied there unhindered on last year's anniversary.
Demonstration bans and police dragnets had thwarted their plans to meet at
Hess's grave in Bavaria.

   But the Thule Network is much more than a place to look for rides to rallies.

   It is a place where Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky is
commended as a "Robin Hood" who wants to protect the downtrodden and keep both
Germany and Russia ethnically pure.

   Suppose some young neo-Nazis want to put out a newspaper, for example, but
lack the know-how. Just plug into "Resistance," one of the network's bulletin
boards.

   "A network-connected attorney can check the text, a graphics office can put
together the newspaper," the Resistance host says in a digital preamble. The
network is also a refuge - where a crowd closely watched by police can disappear
into cyberspace. Technologically ahead of most police, network gatekeepers are

having considerable success keeping out the law.

   Not a single one has been prosecuted.

   "German police don't know much about computers and bulletin boards. It's very
new for them," said Uwe Kauss, editor of the Munich-based computer magazine
Chip, which has penetrated the network through informants.

   Chip estimates 1,500 of Germany's more than 40,000 right-wing extremists are
active on the network. They also say its operators are seeking links with U.S.
comrades such as Nebraska neo-Nazi Gary Lauck, who ships hate literature to
Germany.

   Along with mobile phones and answering machines, the Thule Network is helping
a diverse neo-Nazi scene establish a united front - a phenomenon acknowledged by
Germany's government.

   "Previously, the scene had many loosely connected splinter groups. Now they
are getting in touch more easily," said Matthias Schenk, spokesman for the
Baden-Wuerttemburg agency that monitors enemies of the state.

   All you need to visit Thule boards is a computer and a modem. But to hook up
to the network, you must leave your name, phone number and address. You then
receive a phone call and must pass a loyalty test to get full access.

   Federal officials and law officers in Baden-Wuerttemburg, Bavaria and North
Rhine-Westphalia states, where the Thule boards are located, won't say whether
police agents have infiltrated the network.

   But they speak with frustration of their inability so far to shut down even a
single neo-Nazi bulletin board.

   "This is a very difficult realm for gathering solid evidence," said Schenk,
especially because members post messages and announcements under pseudonyms.

   It's the same with the "infophones," answering machines where rightists leave
messages about political foes. A Mainz man has twice been arrested for running
one, but no charges have been filed and he has boasted he'll just start up
another.

   The extreme right has tapped the power of computer networking, creating a
sophisticated breed of neo-Nazis, such as the publishers of Junge Freiheit, a
35,000-circulation weekly neo-Nazi newspaper in Potsdam.

   In network forums, for example, racist tracts are allowed, but network
operators immediately jump on anyone who boasts of beating up foreigners.

   The heads of the bulletin boards, "Germania," "Elias" and "The Empire," say
on introductory screens loaded with German flags and iron crosses that theirs is
a network of "nonconformists" who oppose the "spirit of the times."

   They post slogans such as "Give Peace a Chance" on their sign-off screens and
include disclaimers denying any intention to violate the law.                                                                       PAGE  113
                     The Associated Press, February 2, 1994                     

   But clever technophiles run these systems.

   A police informant encountered a bomb-making manual on the Resistance system,
located in Erlangen, but it was gone when the informant looked again two days
later, said Ewald Behrschmidt, justice spokesman in nearby Nuremberg.

   If police could determine who put it there - and prove that - they could have
made an arrest, said Behrschmidt.

   The Resistance operator, reportedly a Nuremberg computer science student, has
introduced into a private message area an encryption program called  Pretty 
 Good Privacy  that ensures electronic mail confidentiality.

   The program is so airtight that U.S. authorities are investigating its
Colorado author for possible export law violations because he sent it out
publicly onto the Internet worldwide computer network.

   Such encryption programs are considered weapons under U.S. law.

   So, does that make them explosives in the hands of neo-Nazis?

   I've never had a sip of alcohol, nor any recreational drugs (not one puff to
un-inhale), but, being 38 years old, I feel I was part of the hippie culture. I
was young and rural in the sixties, but my formative years were spent listening
to music created by people who chased the muse down many chemical alleys.

   Top 40 radio blared that the government wasn't to be trusted. Dylan sang
"Phone's tapped anyway," and his inflection said that was a bad thing. But even
as I was sucking up the culture, my skeptical side said that all the "Tin
soldiers and Nixon's coming . . ." stuff might be a little dramatic.
Romanticizing living outside the law, coupled with the physiological effect of
drugs, might be making these artists a little paranoid, a little nutty.

   The joke was kinda on me. Paranoid or not, John Lennon was on Nixon and FBI
hate lists, the Vietnam War probably was a very bad idea, and the Watergate
break-in and subsequent cover-up really did happen. No government is to be
trusted. I could have gotten a stronger lesson from the founding fathers, but
they didn't have any records out. "You say you want a revolution?". . . "The
government that governs least governs best."

   Clinton is younger than any Rolling Stone (unless they replace Bill Wyman
with a new bass player from his ex-wife's generation). It would seem that Bill
Jefferson Clinton would share the mistrust of Big Brother that we tapped our
collective foot to. But remember, he's not Bob Dylan and Neil Young--he's Kenny
G and Fleetwood Mac. Watch him.

   Willy picked up Bush's evil encryption Clipper Chip fascist football and ran
with it ("Meet the new boss--same as the old boss"). The Clipper Chip is
supposed to give us more privacy, which we need. An ex-friend of mine taped
Madonna talking to her business manager on her cordless phone, and some punk
("punk" in the prison sense) broke into my Internet account and read my mail.

   The Clipper Chip, which was designed by government engineers, would be used
to scramble and decode information so that only the addressee could read it. The
government would sell this chip below market value (some people believe they'd
be getting something for nothing; some people believe Elvis put syringes in
Pepsi), and we'd all have cheap privacy. Oh, by the way ("The large print
giveth, the small print taketh away"), the government would keep all the keys so
they could eavesdrop on might-be-bad-guys (with a subpoena, of course).                                                                       PAGE  141

   What?!

   The antiClipper Chip people sent me megs and megs of reasons why the Clipper
Chip sucks (the information on how it works is kept secret, so private
scientists wouldn't be able to check for mistakes; trade with other countries
would be difficult; how safe could the codes be kept?; and so on). Big cheese
computer people yapped against it, and it got shot down the first time around on
the legislation front.

   On the tech front, there is a great cypherpunk ("punk" in the rock and roll
sense) alternative called  Pretty Good Privacy,  which is nongovernment and
free. One of my math-hip friends explained public-key encryption to me, and it's
pretty thinking; I'll try to explain it in a future column. There was even talk
of making private encryption illegal (an evil idea, pure and simple).

   The more research I did, the simpler it got. You have inalienable rights
including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That's it. We have a
right to communicate with anyone we choose without anyone listening in. The
government works for us. Power to the people.

   Look for the new Penn & Teller tour.

       A federal grand jury in San Jose, Calif., has subpoenaed information from a
pair of software companies that distribute a public/private key encryption
program called  Pretty Good Privacy. 

    The program, distributed as freeware by Austin Code Works of Austin, Texas,
is being readied in a licensed version for distribution in the United States and
Canada by ViaCrypt, a division of Lemcom Systems Inc. of Phoenix.

    The subpoenas require the companies to submit records related to the
international distribution of PGP. The program -- which is more powerful than
most encryption programs cleared for export beyond Canada -- has found its way
into countries such as Finland.

    The investigation is part of a complicated web of issues that encompass
First Amendment rights and the use of encryption software to protect
information.

    "We are looking at a very early part of a very long process which involves
... changes in information and information flow," said Eben Moglen, a professor
of law and legal history at Columbia University in New York.

    THE NEWS came, appropriately enough, over the electronic networks: Phil
Zimmermann needs help. The details followed: the US Customs Department is
investigating him to determine whether he was responsible for exporting
full-strength encryption from the US. Under US law, strong encryption is
classified as a munitions.

    Zimmermann is the author of the first version of PGP, which stands for
" Pretty Good Privacy" . The program runs on a variety of microcomputers and is
widely available as freeware on online services all over the world, including
Cix and CompuServe. In fact, the program is probably "exported" many times every
day. Anyone can use it to make sure that their electronic communications are
secure.

    Zimmermann seems to have become interested in cryptography as early as
junior school. Computers came into it later: after taking a computer science
degree in Florida he became a computer consultant specialising in cryptography.
It wasn't until 1991 that PGP 1.0, a DOS program, was released: one of the
technical difficulties was learning how to get computers to do calculations
involving 300-digit numbers. Since then others have built on Zimmermann's work;
there are versions of the program for DEC VAX VMS, Unix and even Microsoft
Windows. There have also been improved DOS versions: we are now up to 2.3.

    PGP is based on the RSA encryption algorithm, named for its developers,
Rivest, Shamir and Adelman. RSA relies on a system called public-key
cryptography. The program starts by generating two keys, a public and a private
one. Your private key is just that: private. You keep it safe and share it with
no one. Your public key, however, you get digitally signed by people who know
you and can attest that it's yours. After that you can distribute it as widely
as you like by any method you like.  There are already "key servers" - one of
them at Demon Internet Limited in London - where public keys are available for
downloading by anyone who wants them. But you will, of course, keep a "key ring"
of your correspondents' public keys, which you will use to decrypt their
messages.

    Public-key cryptography has several elegant features. First, the encryption
really is "industrial strength". Second, the keys authenticate messages as well
as protect them from prying eyes: if a message can be decrypted using your
public key, that's a guarantee that the message came from you - and you can't
later disavow it.                                                                       PAGE  118
                        The Guardian, November 25, 1993                         

    Enter the cypherpunks, to whom Zimmermann is a hero. Instead of relying on
data protection legislation and the goodwill of systems administrators, they
argue, use the computer to give us back the privacy that computerised systems
have taken away.  Think of encryption as an envelope: you wouldn't want to send
all your private mail on postcards, would you? The private nature of the act of
writing electronic mail and messages makes it easy to forget how public they
really are.

    Protecting the privacy of correspondence is only the beginning. Other
proposed uses for encryption include digital cash, which would allow you to pay
for goods and services electronically and anonymously, and selective smart
cards, which would only tell authorities the information they need and no more.
For example, you could have a card that told the DSS you were entitled to
benefit, but gave staff none of your personal details.

    The fact that it's illegal to export strong encryption from the US does not
make it illegal to use PGP in the UK. However, it has been technically illegal
to use PGP inside the US, because the RSA algorithm is patented by RSA Data
Security, a company set up to exploit RSA, which was developed at MIT with
public funding.

    Ironically this patent is not valid in the UK and other countries, because
of prior publication in Scientific American. This situation may be changing: a
commercial version of PGP is being released in the US, and the GATT talks may
uphold such US patents. (Of course many cypherpunks argue that it should not be
possible to patent an algorithm, any more than you should be allowed to patent
the human genome or a compound's molecular structure.)

    The present US Customs investigation doesn't deal with the patent issues,
only the export question. But it's come at the same time as Clinton's Clipper
Chip proposals and the Digital Telephony bill, both of which seek to limit the
strength of encryption available within the US. This has a certain irony:
encryption is too dangerous to be given to the American public, but anyone can
have a gun.

    The result has been to give Zimmermann some of the gloss of a folk hero: he
is regarded as being the man who gave strong encryption to the masses.

    Zimmermann contends that he did not export PGP. But win or lose, he will
face the usual astronomical American legal bills, so a defense fund has been set
up by his attorney (email: dubois@csn.org). And win or lose, the technology is
out there now. No amount of scouring of the world's hard discs will ever bring
it back under control.

   WHILE THE CONTROVERSY BREWING over the Clipper encryption chip focuses on
individual privacy, the privacy issue extends far beyond the borders of your
desktop to the global arena.

   Software that includes strong encryption is subject to strict export controls
in order to minimize the spread of technology that could undermine the
government's ability to gather intelligence. In fact, cryptography is included
on the State Department's list of weapons that could compromise the country's
security.

   Despite attempts to keep the technology stateside, 84 products that employ
the Digital Encryption Standard (DES) are available overseas, says the Software
Publishers Association. But the regulation has succeeded in keeping U.S.
companies out of the global marketplace. And recently, the makers of a software
encryption program called  Pretty Good Privacy  (PGP) have been investigated for
possible export violations. (Both DES and PGP are available on the Internet.)

   The American Civil Liberties Union has questioned the rule's
constitutionality. "We think it's a violation of the First Amendment for the
government to say you can't export those products because computer software is a
form of speech that's given special protection," says Kate Martin, director of
the ACLU's Center for National Security Studies.

   ALTHOUGH THE "data superhighway" planned by the current administration is not
yet a reality, thousands of confidential documents and electronic mail messages
are racing around the country, many of them between attorneys and their clients.
Unfortunately, the security of these documents and messages is a matter of
controversy and media attention.

   Increasingly, attorneys and clients are staying in touch with each other via
e-mail.  In some cases documents or messages are transmitted over "dedicated
lines" or telephone lines linked directly between client and attorney.  These
dedicated lines provide a high measure of security.  However, most documents and
messages are transmitted via third party e-mail service providers, who lease
"mail boxes" to which subscribers can dial in to send and receive electronic
mail.  These mailboxes can direct mail to other service providers, so that
potentially, a message or document may pass through several systems before it
reaches the intended recipient.

   Even if one does not consider malicious interference, the number of systems
handling a document, and the increasing complexity of addressing an e-mail
message greatly increases the likelihood of incorrectly addressed mail.

   Ten years ago, when facsimile machines were relatively new, misdirected faxes
was not a great concern.  Today fax machines are so commonplace that law firms
and businesses routinely place a confidentiality notice on the cover page.  From
this standpoint, there is far greater risk of an undetected misdirected e-mail
than a fax.  A misdialed fax must arrive at another fax machine or no
transmission can occur.  An incorrectly addressed e-mail message may be
"bounced" and returned to the sender, or equally likely, may be sent to the
wrong party, and the sender may never be aware of the mistake.

   When "hackers and crackers" and other technological miscreants are added to
the equation, the likelihood of an e-mail disaster in the legal profession looms
ominously.

   Computer experts have been concerned with e-mail and telecommunications
security for many years.  In addition to worrying about accidents and hackers,
there is fear of unwarranted monitoring of e-mail communications by government
agencies.  And of course, government agencies (particularly the military) have
been concerned about security since the beginning of telecommunications.                                                                       PAGE  121
                     New York Law Journal, November 9, 1993                     

   The solution is cryptography, the science of codes and ciphers, which for
many years was a somewhat arcane field of mathematics.

   Using "traditional" techniques, a confidential message or document would be
encrypted pursuant to a complex series of mathematical algorithms.  A single
password would be used to both encrypt and decrypt the document or message.

   This approach continues to be quite commonplace as a security measure in
business and industry.  Unfortunately, such an approach has certain difficulties
and vulnerabilities.

   A single password encryption scheme requires that both the sender and the
receiver have the same password.  However, the mechanism for transmitting the
password is problematic.  If any attorney is uncomfortable with the security
associated with transmitting the document via e-mail, then e-mail would not be
adequate means to convey the password.

   Further, communicating the password via telephone or regular mail becomes
cumbersome, especially if long or complex passwords are used.  Finally, in a
large organization, there may be many people who will be generating or receiving
confidential materials.  A single password system requires that each such person
have access to that password and keep it confidential.

   A solution to this problem was arrived at in the mid 1970s, when "public key
cryptography" was developed.  In brief, there are actually two "keys" or
passwords in a public key cryptography scheme.  One key, a public key, "locks"
or encrypts documents.  The other key, a private key, "unlocks" or decrypts the
document.  The keys are matched and generally quite large (they are long strings
of apparently random characters, rather than the traditional one or two word
password).

   In using a public key cryptography system, a user generates a public key and
a private key.  The public key would then be made available to the
world-at-large.

   Anyone could then use the public key to encrypt documents, messages, etc.
However, only the intended recipient could decrypt the message, using the
private key.

   Such a system solves many problems.  Virtually anyone can securely send
encrypted documents.  If the documents are intercepted or routed to the wrong
person, there is little anyone could do without the private key (short of using
a supercomputer for long periods of time).

   Perhaps even more exciting is the concept of a "digital signature" which
public key cryptography creates.  A unique aspect to certain public key
cryptography systems is the ability to generate unique identifier codes or
"signatures" which can be attached to documents, e-mail messages, etc.  The
digital signature can only be generated using the private key, and can only be
confirmed as valid using the public key.

   The result is that if someone distributes a document which purports to be
"signed," the recipient can confirm the identity of the sender by testing the
signature with the sender's public key.  If the recipient is confident that the
public key is genuine, she can validate the signature because only the                                                                       PAGE  122
                     New York Law Journal, November 9, 1993                     

corresponding private key can generate a digital signature which can be
validated by the public key.

   This technology opens entire new avenues for lawyers and business people,
because, in essence, it permits truly "paperless" transactions.  For many years,
banking and securities institutions have authorized without a manual signature.
However, in general, elaborate precautions were put in place, including
dedicated lines, hardware access restrictions, etc. to prevent fraud.  Lawyers
and business people are generally unwilling to eliminate manual signatures
because such procedures are too onerous.  However, with the advent of public key
cryptography, electronic "signatures" may become commonplace:

   For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission is accepting
electronically "signed" filings under its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis
and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.  Manual signatures are not required for a valid
filing, but must be maintained on file.

   New word processing and e-mail software packages are now incorporating public
key cryptography technology.  It is therefore not unimaginable that in the near
future, documents will be executed and delivered electronically, without the
need for "hard copy."
 
Patent Controversy

   However, at the same time this technology is opening up new legal vistas, it
is being scrutinized.  At the heart of the controversy is a software package
called " Pretty Good Privacy"  or PGP as it is generally known.

   This package was written several years ago by Philip Zimmermann and
distributed free to interested parties.  Since that initial release PGP has been
updated by others and is still available, free of charge, from many computer
sources around the world.

   The controversy initially concerned the issue of patent infringement.  PGP
was based on a series of algorithms developed at MIT by several researchers.
Those algorithms were originally publicly published.  Thereafter they were
licensed to a private concern to be sold or licensed commercially.  The private
company which holds the license to the algorithms claimed that PGP infringed on
its patents.

   Recently, the company has agreed to sublicense the public key cryptography
technology to a second company to develop a commercial version of PGP.  Shortly
after the infringement issue appeared to be resolved (or close to resolution)
another, less mundane issue surfaced.

   A federal grand jury subpoenaed both software companies, apparently concerned
that the technology would be (or had been) illegally exported in violation of
State Department regulations.  The department regulates the export of weapons
and other technology which might be a threat to national security.  Cryptography
software and technology is classified as such a potential threat, and therefore
its export is subject to governmental regulation as a "munition." Unfortunately
for the government, PGP is available world wide.

   To add further controversy, the government proposed its own cryptography
standard, incorporated in a tamper proof computer chip referred to as the                                                                       PAGE  123
                     New York Law Journal, November 9, 1993                     

"Clipper Chip." The proposal was made in response to concerns that cryptography
technology generally available to the public (such as PGP) would cripple law
enforcement agencies' ability to monitor phone conversations or data
transmissions under a valid court order.

   The Clipper Chip is designed to require two encryption keys which would be
"escrowed" with two separate government agencies.  Upon a court order, both
government agencies would provide their keys to law enforcement agencies, which
would then allow them to "crack" any transmissions made using that particular
Clipper Chip.

   The "Big Brother" aspect of the regulation of cryptography systems upset many
in the computer and legal community concerned with privacy rights.  Further, to
date, the government is unwilling to publicly release the details of the Clipper
Chip algorithms.

   Cryptography experts and aficionados (cypherpunks) argue that without
rigorous public scrutiny, there is no way of assuring that the Clipper Chip
technology is truly secure, or worse, does not incorporate a secret "back door"
under which someone could by-pass the security without the escrowed keys.  The
final evaluation and recommendation on the proposal by the government are
pending.

   Regardless of the outcome of both the PGP and Clipper Chip cases, however, it
is apparent that cryptography is becoming an important tool in business and law.
It is one of the few cases where an inability to understand what a lawyer says
may be a good thing.

   On Sept. 17, bureaucrats claiming to act in your best interest again
interfered with your ability to protect network transmissions using the best,
most cost-effective encryption algorithms available. It's time for network
managers to take action to stop government meddling in the business of privacy.

   U.S. manufacturers are not permitted to export their most powerful encryption
tools without a license. The difficulty of obtaining such export licenses forces
U.S. manufacturers either to forego sales outside the U.S. and Canada or to
produce a weaker version of their software for international distribution.

   The costs of maintaining the different versions are paid for in higher prices
for U.S. users. Similarly, giving away foreign markets also decreases the
profits of U.S. firms and keeps prices higher than they could be if vigorous
competition were the rule.

   In addition, U.S. taxpayers have been paying bureaucrats' salaries to apply
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to encryption software.
According to ITAR, the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the U.S. Department
of State can define anything it wants as equivalent to munitions. There is
nothing to stop the bureaucrats from adding the decoder rings found in popcorn
boxes to the U.S. Munitions List and designating them as a restricted export.

   Just because some paper-pusher claims that encryption is a munition shouldn't
make it so. In the words of Lennart Benschop of Eindhoven University of
Technology in the Netherlands, Making cryptographic software equivalent to
munitions is just as foolish as making addictive crossword puzzles equivalent to
drugs.''

   The notion that the U.S. government should let alone can prevent foreign
nationals from having access to encryption technology was never reasonable in
the first place, but it's ludicrous today.

   Trying to restrict the export of encryption programs in this age of the
global Internet is about as useful as trying to keep cigarette smoke from
drifting into the no-smoking zone in your favorite restaurant. Trying to control
the flow of information via diskette or paper when data can travel unimpeded
through the Internet is just plain dumb. How can a government official stop
international users from using anonymous File Transfer Protocol to get a copy of
any encryption algorithm found on a file server anywhere in the world?

   ITAR's application to software is unenforceable and has been for years. One
can already find encryption technology of the highest quality everywhere on the
planet, ITAR notwithstanding.

   On Sept. 17, the latest incident in which the federal government has
attempted to enforce these ill-conceived regulations occurred. Grady Ward,
president of Austin Code Works (ACW), a software firm in Austin, Texas, was                                                                       PAGE  125
                        Network World, November 8, 1993                         

ordered by a U.S. Customs special agent to turn over all paper and electronic
documents pertaining to the distribution of ACW's encryption products.

   Ward has compiled a 9M-byte anthology of already published encryption source
code, which he called Moby Crypto.'' This collection includes no executable code
only the algorithmic descriptions in C language that can be found (and exported)
from scores of books and journals from the U.S. and elsewhere already freely
distributed throughout the world.

   Ward argued that the only difference between his cryptographic whale'' and
other descriptions of encryption algorithms is that Moby Crypto'' is purely
electronic, whereas textbooks and journal articles which are freely circulated
internationally without interference from ITAR are printed on paper pulp.'' Even
the Supreme Court, he continued, will provide its judgments in electronic form,
and electronic White House records must be treated with the same respect as
official paper documents.

   Another software company, Phoenix-based ViaCrypt, was served with a similar
subpoena because it recently contracted to sell a commercial version of  Pretty 
 Good Privacy  (PGP), an encryption utility that has been circulated worldwide
via the Internet. Although the first version of PGP was written in the U.S. by
software author Phil Zimmermann, Version 2.0 of PGP came from the Netherlands,
not the U.S.

   The Electronic Freedom Foundation, which is dedicated to supporting the cause
of liberty in cyberspace, has publicly announced its intention to support ACW
and ViaCrypt, stating, Neither of these companies are engaged in the
international distribution of any illegal materials... If Moby Crypto contains
no executable code, it should be exportable under ITAR, just as textbooks
containing such materials are exportable.'' A legal defense fund has been
started to help defray the enormous costs that these two victims of bureaucratic
meddling are likely to incur.

   ITAR is not a dead letter either. The latest modifications to ITAR are
reported in the July 22 issue of the Federal Register.

   Network managers need encryption technology to secure transmissions against
eavesdropping and stored data against unauthorized access. You should brook no
interference with the natural evolution of this technology.

   The House Foreign Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on Economic Policy, Trade
and the Environment held a hearing on mass market cryptography and export
controls on Oct. 12 at which speakers from industry expressed outrage over
inclusion of cryptography in ITAR. Chairman Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) opened the
hearing with a statement that summed up the situation pretty clearly: Just as in
the case of telecommunications, the National Security Agency is attempting to
put the genie back in the bottle. It won't happen; and a vibrant and productive
sector of American industry may be sacrificed in the process.''

   In (nearly) the words of former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, The
government has no place in the file servers of the nation.'' Tell your
congressional representatives to take cryptography out of ITAR.

   Philip Zimmermann wanted to strike a blow for freedom. To help computer users
keep data safe from snoopers, the Boulder (Colo.) software consultant and
self-described "privacy activist" wrote a program making it easy to encode
messages with an all-but-unbreakable cipher. And he offered it free through the
network known as the Internet.

    Now, Zimmermann's gift to cyberspace has exposed an enormous gap in the
Administration's vision of a high-tech future. The White House is promoting a
data superhighway as a key to a competitive future. But the National Security
Agency is trying to restrict the use of high-quality encryption, which experts
believe business will need to take full advantage of the "information
infrastructure."

    The focus of the fight is a program Zimmermann calls " pretty good privacy" 
(PGP). On Sept. 9, two software companies in Texas and Arizona that have been
involved in publishing PGP received federal grand-jury subpoenas requesting
documents and information about the program. CRACKDOWN. Although the government
won't discuss the investigation, the computer world has a pretty good idea
what's going on. Because sophisticated encryption allows friends and foes alike
to protect communications, the software is subject to the same export controls
as munitions. But PGP has popped up all over the world. The probe, says
Zimmermann's lawyer, Philip Dubois, is aimed at "finding out how it occurred and
whether an offense was committed."

    Oddly, the crackdown on software comes just as the Administration is
loosening export controls on computer hardware. But the schizophrenia may be
more apparent than real. "I don't think they've got the export policy together
enough to be split," says a key congressional staffer. The underlying problem,
explains Paul Freedenberg, a Washington attorney and export-control specialist,
is that "Clinton is very cautious about dabbling in national security. This is
an area that has essentially been turned over to the spooks."

    Meanwhile, there is growing concern in Congress about possible damage to
exports. Quality encryption software "is available from foreign
manufacturers...and is easily transmitted using only a long-distance telephone
line and a modem," complained Representative Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.) and a
high-powered bipartisan group of colleagues in a Sept. 20 letter to the
President. "Yet the U.S. continues to control this computer software as a
Munitions List item." Says Douglas Miller of the Software Publishers Assn.: "The
U.S. government is succeeding only in crippling an American industry's exporting
ability."                                                                       PAGE  128

    While the goal of the NSA and other security agencies -- keeping U.S.
messages secure while allowing Uncle Sam to read those of both domestic and
foreign bad guys -- is laudable, technology may be rendering it impossible. "Law
enforcers no longer have the inside track," says Eben Moglen of Columbia
University law school.

    Experts agree that NSA officials are smart enough to see the writing on the
wall, encrypted or not. But, says James Bitzos, president of RSA Data Security
Inc. in Redwood City, Calif., the agency wants to maintain as much control as
possible for as long as possible. Today, intelligence agencies still have a shot
at finding "needles in the haystack," he says. "If they lift export controls,
they might as well go home."

    Still, the NSA can't stave off the inevitable for long. Gejdenson hopes to
produce legislation by early next year to revamp government policy on high-tech
exports. The result will probably include looser restrictions on encryption
software -- and a victory for Phil Zimmermann in his battle to keep snoops out
of his cyberspace.

   When Charles and Diana discovered millions of people were reveling in their
most intimate telephone calls, the world's most public couple had to face the
facts of private life in the electronic age.

   In a world of cellular phones, computer networks, electronic mail and
interactive TV, the walls might as well have ears.

   With the explosion of such devices, more people and companies -- from banks
to department stores -- seem to have more access to more information that
someone wants to keep private. In response, computer users are devising their
own electronic codes to protect such secrets as corporate records, personal mail
or automated teller transactions.

   Historically, the biggest ears have belonged to the federal government, which
has used surveillance techniques designed to track down criminals and security
risks to keep electronic tabs on subjects ranging from civil rights leaders to
citizens making overseas calls.

   But, today, federal officials are afraid that advanced technology, which for
almost 50 years has allowed them to conduct surveillance on a global scale, is
about to make such monitoring impossible.

   Now, federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies are insisting on their
right to eavesdrop.

   The government is proposing a standardized coding, or encryption, system that
would eliminate eavesdropping by anyone except the one holder of the code's key
-- the government itself.

   To ensure that federal agents and police can continue to wiretap
communications, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is
introducing a national electronic code. It will cover all telephone systems and
computer transmissions, with a built-in back door that police can unlock with a
court order and an electronic key.                                                                       PAGE  132
                       Los Angeles Times, October 3, 1993                       

   White House and FBI officials insist they have no way to force any company to
adopt the new technology. They will not outlaw other forms of coding, they said.

   But experts say a series of regulatory actions involving Congress, the State
Department, the U.S. attorney general, export licensing restrictions and the
purchasing power of the federal government will effectively force people to use
the code.

   The government's plan has triggered an outcry among computer users, civil
rights groups and others. The American Civil Liberties Union and groups of
computer professionals say the plan raises major constitutional questions.
Federal laws are designed to limit the government's ability to wiretap, not
guarantee it, they say.

   "Where does the U.S. government get the right to understand everything that
is transmitted?" asked Michel Kabay, director of education for the National
Computer Security Assn. in Carlisle, Pa.

   Not so many years ago, powerful encryption techniques were the monopoly of
military and intelligence agencies. Over time, computer experts and corporate
cryptographers created codes to protect their private communications. Some of
these scramble electronic signals so thoroughly that even the supercomputers of
the National Security Agency cannot decipher them. One of the best codes, called
 Pretty Good Privacy,  is free and can be downloaded from computer network
libraries around the world -- yet it still contains safeguards that protect its
secrets from prying eyes.

   Combined with advances in fiber optics and digital communications, these
codes enable people to send electronic mail, computer files and faxes the
government cannot read, and to make phone calls even the most sophisticated
wiretapper cannot understand.

   As new technologies converge to form the roadbed of a national information
superhighway, the government faces the prospect of millions of people around the
world communicating in the absolute privacy of the most secure codes science can
devise.

   At the same time, hundreds of phone companies channel calls through new
digital switches into long-distance fiber-optic cables where, translated into
light-speed laser pulses, they may elude interception more easily. Dozens of
other companies are organizing global wireless digital networks to send phone
calls, faxes and computer files over the airwaves to people no matter where they
are or how often they move.

   Given all this, NIST officials say the new code, called Skipjack, is the
government's attempt to strike a balance between personal privacy and public
safety.

   They say it will protect people from illicit eavesdropping, while allowing an
authorized government agent to unlock any scrambled call or encrypted computer
message. It could be incorporated into virtually every computer modem, cellular
phone and telecommunications system manufactured in the United States.

   Designed by the National Security Agency, which conducts most of the
country's communications surveillance, the code is one facet of an ambitious                                                                       PAGE  133
                       Los Angeles Times, October 3, 1993                       

government blueprint for the new information age.

   But critics say the code is just one of several steps by federal law
enforcement groups and intelligence agencies to vastly expand their ability to
monitor all telecommunications and to access computer databases.

   Federal officials acknowledge that they are even considering the idea that
foreign governments should be given the keys to unlock long-distance calls,
faxes and computer transmissions from the United States. An international
agency, supervised by the United Nations or Interpol, might be asked to hold in
trust the keys to electronic codes, said Clint Brooks, a senior NSA technical
adviser.

   The Skipjack furor pits the White House, the FBI and some of the government's
most secret agencies against privacy advocates, cipher experts, business
executives and ragtag computer-zoids who say codes the government cannot break
are the only way to protect the public from the expanding reach of electronic
surveillance.

   On the computer networks that link millions of users and self-styled
Cypherpunks -- a group of encryption specialists -- the federal proposal has
stirred fears of an electronic Big Brother and the potential abuse of power.

   "It really is Orwellian when a scheme for surveillance is described as a
proposal for privacy," said Marc Rotenberg, Washington director of Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility.

   Encryption is the art of concealing information in the open by hiding it in a
code. It is older than the alphabet, which is itself a code that almost everyone
knows how to read.

   Today, electronic codes conceal trade secrets, protect sensitive business
calls and shelter personal computer mail. They also scramble pay-per-view cable
television programs and protect electronic credit card transactions.

   Everyone who uses an automated teller machine is entrusting financial secrets
to an electronic code that scrambles transmissions between the automated teller
and the bank's main computer miles away. One inter-bank network moves $1
trillion and 1 million messages around the world every day, swaddled in the
protective cocoon of its code.

   Nowhere has the demand for privacy grown so urgent as on the international
confederation of computer systems known as the Internet. There, in a proving
ground for the etiquette of electronic communication, millions of people in
dozens of countries are adopting codes to protect their official business, swap
gossip and exchange personal notes elbow-to-elbow in the same crowded electronic
bazaar.

   "People have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers,
darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes and couriers," said Eric
Hughes, moderator of the Cypherpunks, an Internet group that specializes in
encryption. "We are defending privacy with cryptography, with anonymous
mail-forwarding systems, with digital signatures and with electronic money."                                                                       PAGE  134
                       Los Angeles Times, October 3, 1993                       

   And it's working. The technology is leaving law enforcement behind.

   Federal officials who defend the Skipjack plan say they are worried about too
much privacy in the wrong hands.

   "Are we going to let technology repeal this country's wiretap laws?" asked
James K. Kallstrom, FBI chief of investigative technology. Under U.S. law, any
wiretap not sanctioned by a court order is a felony.

   Federal law enforcement agencies and intelligence groups were galvanized last
fall when AT&T introduced the first inexpensive mass-market device to scramble
phone calls. The scrambler contains a computer chip that generates an electronic
code unique to each conversation.

   FBI officials paled at what they said was the prospect of racketeers, drug
dealers or terrorists being able to find sophisticated phone scramblers to code

and decode calls at the nearest phone store.

   National security analysts and Defense Department officials say U.S.
intelligence agencies find the new generation of computer encryption techniques
especially unsettling. It promises to make obsolete a multibillion-dollar
investment in secret surveillance facilities and spy satellites.

   "We would have the same concerns internationally that law enforcement would
have domestically about uncontrolled encryption," said Stewart A. Baker, NSA
general counsel.

   NSA officials are reluctant to discuss their surveillance operations, but
they said they would not want terrorists or anyone else "targeting the United
States" to be able to communicate in the secrecy provided by unbreakable modern
codes.

   The Clinton Administration is expected to advise telecommunications and
computer companies this fall to adopt the Skipjack code as a new national
encryption standard used by the government, the world's largest computer user,
and anyone who does business with it.

   The government also will be spending billions in the next 10 years to promote
a public network of telecommunications systems and computer networks called the
National Information Infrastructure. Any firm that wants to join will have to
adopt the Skipjack code.

   Skipjack is being offered to the public embedded in a tamper-proof, $26
computer circuit called the Clipper Chip. It is produced by Mykotronx Inc., a
computer company in Torrance.

   To make it easier for agents to single out the proper conversation in a
stream of signals, every Clipper Chip has its own electronic identity and
broadcasts it in every message it scrambles.

   Federal agents conducting a court-authorized wiretap can identify the code
electronically and then formally request the special keys that allow an outsider
to decipher what the chip has scrambled.                                                                       PAGE  135
                       Los Angeles Times, October 3, 1993                       

   Federal officials say they expect companies to incorporate the chip into
consumer phone scramblers, cellular phones and "secure" computer modems. Within
a few years, FBI officials say, they expect the Skipjack code to be part of
almost every encryption device available to the average consumer.

   Many companies say they are leery of adopting the sophisticated electronic
code, even though it could protect them from foreign intelligence agencies and
competitors seeking their trade secrets. But AT&T, which has a long history of
cooperating with the government on communications surveillance, has already
agreed to recall the company's consumer scramblers and refit them this fall with
the new chip.

   Even without Skipjack and the Clipper Chip, advanced computers and electronic
databases already have expanded government's ability to track and monitor
citizens.

   Searches of phone records, computer credit files and other databases are at
an all-time high, and court-authorized wiretaps -- which listened in on 1.7
million phone conversations last year -- monitor twice as many conversations as
a decade ago, federal records show.

   The General Accounting Office says that federal agencies maintain more than
900 databanks containing billions of personal records about U.S. citizens.

   This type of easy access to electronic information is addictive, critics
contend.

   Since the FBI set up its computerized National Criminal Information Center in
1967, for example, information requests have grown from 2 million a year to
about 438 million last year, and the criminal justice database itself now
encompasses 24 million files.

   The FBI records system, like computer files at the Internal Revenue Service,
is "routinely" used for unauthorized purposes by some federal, state and local
law enforcement agencies, the General Accounting Office said.

   GAO auditors found that some police agencies have used the FBI system to
investigate political opponents. Others have sold FBI information to companies
and private investigators. In Arizona, a former law enforcement official used it
to track down his estranged girlfriend and kill her, the auditors reported.

   What the government can't find in its own files, it can obtain from any one
of hundreds of marketing firms that specialize in compiling electronic dossiers
on citizens. The FBI is seeking authority from Congress to obtain those records
without consulting a judge or notifying the individual involved, which is
required now.

   Information America, for example, offers data on the location and profiles of
more than 111 million Americans, 80 million households and 61 million telephone
numbers. Another firm specializes in gay men and lesbians.

   A third, a service for doctors called Patient Select, singles out millions of
people with nervous stomachs.                                                                       PAGE  136
                       Los Angeles Times, October 3, 1993                       

   Computer experts say encryption can draw a curtain across such electronic
windows into private life.

   In fact, the FBI is planning to encrypt its criminal justice computer files.

   "Recent years have seen technological developments that diminish the privacy
available to the individual," said Whitfield Diffie, a pioneering computer
scientist who helped invent modern cryptography. "Cameras watch us in the
stores, X-ray machines search us at the airport, magnetometers look to see that
we are not stealing from the merchants, and databases record our actions and
transactions.

   "Cryptography," he said, "is perhaps alone in its promise to give us more
privacy rather than less."

   NEXT: Inside the company that makes the secret chip.
 
Scrambling for Privacy

   As more people and companies adopt codes to protect their telephone calls,
faxes and computer files, the federal government has proposed a national
encryption standard that will allow people to protect their privacy while
ensuring that law enforcement agents can still wiretap telecommunications. Here
is how it would work:

   1. When someone using a Skipjack-equipped secure phone calls another secure
phone, chips inside the phone generate a unique electronic code to scramble the
conservation.

   2. The chip also broadcasts a unique identifying serial number.

   3. If a law enforcement agent wants to listen in, he first must obtain a
court order and the get the chip's serial number from the signal.

   4. The agent obtains takes that number to the Treasury Department and the
National Institute of Standards and Technology, which keep the government's
digital keys to the chip.

   5. The keys are combined to unscramble the conversation. When legal
authorization for the wiretap expires, the keys are destroyed.

   Programming the Clipper Chip

   Each Clipper Chip is permanently imprinted with a unique serial number, a
unique key and a family key.

   1. Two 80-digit random strings of zeros and ones are selected.

   2. They are factored together to form the chip's unique key the key is then
split in half.

   3. Each half is paired with the serial number of the chip to form two keys.

   5. One is kept by the Treasury Department and the other by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology.

Someone Is Listening

   To eavesdrop on a telephone conversation, law enforcement agents must obtain
a court order, but they can use other devices, such as so-called pen registers,
that record incoming or outgoing telephone numbers without actually listening to
the calls.

   WIRETAP COURT ORDERS

   From 1985 through 1991, court-ordered wiretaps resulted in 7,324 convictions
and nearly $300 million in fines. A single court order can involve many
telephones. This data includes federal and state orders, but does not include
many national security wiretaps.
1985: 784
1986: 754
1987: 673
1988: 738
1989: 763
1990: 872
1991: 856
1992: 919

   In a decision with implications for free speech and data privacy, a US
Federal grand jury has issued subpoenas to two software companies that sell
versions of a popular data encryption program, according to a report in The New
York Times.

   The investigation seems to be focusing on whether the programs, based on the
encryption software  Pretty Good Privacy  (PGP), have been exported in violation
of State Department regulations controlling the sale of weapons and other
technologies deemed to compromise national security.

   ViaCrypt and Austin Code Works, the companies at the centre of the inquiry,
intend to sell licensed versions of PGP to software developers for incorporation
into their own programs. Under the terms of the subpoenas, the companies have
had to submit all correspondence and records relating to the international
distribution of their products, although both companies claim to have no
intention to sell their products abroad. "I think their more concerned with our
intentions than what we've done", said Leonard Mikus, president of Viacrypt.
"They're on a fishing expedition, but this could become a landmark case that
sets the limits that distinguish between electronic and conventional
publishing".
