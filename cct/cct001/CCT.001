        YES! another electronic newspaper hits cyberspace and what timing!
I would like to welcome all the readers to this new electronic newspaper
that is information oriented.  What you will find here is specific info
on viruses, computer underground, and things that users have asked to add
to the newspaper as we grow.  You will not find any information on how to
phreak or how to cause terror in your community, so if this is what your
into then you might as well delete this newspaper off your hard drive now
and focus on your point of interest.  Anyone who would like to submit
anything to this newspaper is more than welcome to.  Any information found
in this newspaper does not imply that the staff believes it to be true and
does not imply that the staff shares the same view points.  The object is
let the readers draw their own conclusion about any information found in
here.

        If you think you have anything to offer or looking for a place
to pick up the lastest edition of Chiba City Times, please contact us
at Chiba City Blues@804.790.1329. We have 2 nodes online now, with 1.45
gig's of transfer support, with plenty of virus related topics, security
related topics, and general information topics to keep you reading for
years.
