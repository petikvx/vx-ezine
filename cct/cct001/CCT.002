This message is to members of Virnet and prospective members of Virnet.

Do you know that when you join Virnet that the coordinators of that network are
performing personal background checks on their members?
Do you know they are pulling credit records and legal records on
their nodes?

They didn't tell me they would pull my credit record.  They never informed me
that they would check my legal record.  There is nothing
in those that I am ashamed of, but do they have the right to do this
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NODE?  Why would Virnet need to know about
my credit background?  Why should Virnet need to know if I have a speeding
ticket or anything else?

Running a BBS is a hobby, not a business.  My feeling about this is that they
do not have the right to invade my privacy in order to run a network.
Especially without my knowledge.

How would you feel to learn that your legal records are being passed
overseas because you were interested in reading and participating in
an anti-virus network.

I don't want any part of Virnet and these personal investigations.  I
am glad I am no longer a member.

Well, I got a call from Mr. Nuemann (spelling?) last night, and we spent about
two hours on the phone, during which time he told me things about you (the
same things that you had already told me), and we got into a discussion about
having virus writers in the net. I told him that, yes, there should be SOME
screening, but that the net would be better served if they had at least SOME
opposing information allowed access, but he disagreed. I might have been
willing to stay in the net, had he not basically confirmed your statements
about background checks. He said that they DO hire Private Investigators to
look into the backgrounds of "questionable" people. At that point, I told him
that I believed that they had overstepped the bounds of ANY network, and that
what they are doing may indeed be illegal. I also told him that my privacy and
integrity were MUCH more important to me than ANY net, and could no longer
afford to be associated with their net.

Anyway, to make a long story short, I am no longer associated with VirNet, and
their communistic approach to what is STILL basically a hobby.

P.S.  Steve LOVED my response to their message, and whole-heartedly agrees.

Well Pam, looks like they finally did it to you. I'm not even too sure I want
to remain in the net. Especially after reading what Steve Baker wrote. Hey,
I've got no complaints with the service you've given me, and, even though we
haven't REALLY chatted about much, enjoyed what few messages I received from
you. I do remember the one where you said that you were considered a
troublemaker (or words to that effect) in the net, which only made me even
MORE glad to have you as a hub, as I've always been considered (at least at
work...smile) a troublemaker by some. Well, I have to go, and hope to hear
from you...would like to keep in contact.

Whoa big boy! Where the hell do you get off telling me that you're not "happy
with the relationship of this node to Ms. Trexler"? For your information I
just joined this net less than a month ago, and have only been receiving e-
mail and some files from her. Pam has been very "above-board" with me, and I
have had absolutely NO problems with her, and I think you all are a little bit
too paranoid. Besides which, I resent any inferences you have just made. I
don't have to clear myself with you or ANY other "god-like" individual! As for
submitting a new NEWNODES.VIR, forget it! I JUST sent in a new one, and talked
VOICE with Efrayim, and will NOT do so again! I'm sending a copy of this
message straight to him. As far as I'm concerned, this net is DEAD! I, along
with Steve Baker, had high hopes for this net, hoping to receive good,
pertinent info on viruses and how to eliminate them. NOT to listen to petty
bickering and innuendos. Unless I receive an apology in short order, I will
remove all references in my system, to this net. Oh yeah, Sara was the one who
assigned me to Pam.


Efrayim, sorry about this, but I don't need any crap like this from ANYONE. I
enjoyed the talk we had, and hope you don't take any of this personally.
