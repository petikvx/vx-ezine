Network Guidelines
------------------

1) Any bbs requesting feed needs to send its request to Chiba City Blues
   804.790.1329.  You will find the request for feed for at the end of this
   document.

2) No illegal information like PBX codes, credit card numbers, or child pro-
   nography will be tolerated on this network.  We strongly suggest that
   each ChibaNet sysop offers the latest version of PGP for its users to
   download.

3) Handles are allowed and encouraged.

4) It is the each and every sysop's job to encourage it's users to be involved
   If you are the type of sysop that does not particpate in your own bbs and
   its messages bases then you are not wanted in this net.

5) All mail sessions are required to have a session password.

6) Strong vulgar language will not be tolerated on this network.  While a
   intense discussion requires a selected strong word now and then but
   meaningless cussing will not be tolerated and sysops who do not take
   care of any users who dis-regards this important guideline will be
   removed from the net.


Purpose
-------

  ChibaNet is dedicated to the complete freedom of information.  It is
  an educational institute open to the general public of cyberspace.
  We stand in the threashold of a new era, where more people have
  access to computers and modems.  Who's responsible for teaching the
  norms of cyberspace?  The Media?  The government? Or maybe the people
  that were here first....

  If you are a sysop receiving feed from this net, please consider it your
  net too and ANY input is welcome concerning guidelines, message bases, etc
  Current message areas with a breakdown description can be found later in
  this document.  Message topics include everything from computer consipracy's
  to computer security.  We do not consider this to be a H/P/C/A/T/G/H/J/Q
  elite net, where only a select few can come play, but more of a information
  net where everyone is welcome.

  We are not mad hackers out for destruction, vandalism, or anarchy but
  indiviual who specialize in information.  We hope you share the same views
  as well....
