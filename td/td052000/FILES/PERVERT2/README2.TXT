                                Professional

                                release 2.00

  Well, this is the second generation of CodePervertor. It has been fully
  rewritten, 'coz of some major changes.

  Added:
    1. More options (see -?)

    2. Disassembler.
       Now all 'code' may be perverted, including code in different sections
       and/or header.

    3. External data file (see PERVERT2.DAT)
       Now you may specify your own bitmasks, i.e. add any new mutable
       instructions.
***WARNING***:
       PERVERT2.DAT by default should be in the same directory with .EXE file
