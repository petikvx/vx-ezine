                           Volume 001  Issue 1


Mutation Magazine is its own final publication.  There will likely be
no more additions to the series.  The magazine is intended to be viewed
through its own neat little windowing menu interface, but if you are too
scared to run it in this age of trojan and viral warfare, feel free to
just type out the magazine file.

We guarantee this file only to take up space on the end user's system.
We in no way guarantee safe operation or any other facet of reasonable
expectations.  You get what you pay for, and this is freeware.
