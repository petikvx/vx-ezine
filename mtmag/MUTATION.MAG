Welcome to the Premier Issue of Mutation Magazine.

Mutation magazine is a spoof of all k-rad elite magazines.
This magazine is meant to offer a breath of fresh air to all of the many
concentrating-so-hard-on-being-elite-that-I-popped-a-blood-vessel types.
It is in many cases facetious and in almost all cases tongue-in-cheek.
We do include several non-fiction files and articles in each magazine 
just to keep you guessing,  but for the most part this magazine is for 
entertainment purposes only.  When some items included in this magazine 
seem to be controversial to some extent,  don't worry - we planned it 
that way and enjoy watching you all squirm.

                           Mutation Magazine

Mutation magazine was coded completely in assembler and as such has one of  
the fastest interfaces seen in a magazine.  Some routines such as display
functions actually had to be delayed in order for them to be more than 
little flashes of light on the CRT.  Mutation magazine currently has but
two on-staff writers:  Splice and Einstein.  Strangely enough, they also
are responsible for its production, Splice the programming, and Einstein
the graphics.  

Splice is a current NuKE member and as such enjoys immense access to the 
latest virus and trojan related materials.  He is also well known in the 
hacking and phreaking scene as he was part of the original group which 
released BlueBeep.  

Einstein is a current Union member who specializes in ANSI/RIP artwork 
for various systems around the country.  In doing this, he has come 
in contact with all facets of the national underground community.  He 
is well qualified to draw parallels between it and our own local little 
hell.

If you would like to join the Mutation team and take an oath affirming 
that you will never transpose the letters 's' and 'z', then by all means 
please get in contact with us.  How to contact us will be left up to you.

===========================================================================

Dear Mutation Magazine:

Even though I've never seen your magazine, I felt compelled to write you.
My name is Carlton Smith, Jr., and I run the Crystal Clear Ideas EBBS.
        
        --S: The child molester guy??
        --E: no no no...  he just takes pictures..
        --S: oh... well thats ok then.

I would like to inform you that I disapprove of your magazine, and all
of the ideas contained therein.  I feel that the gross personal attacks
which are fielded against me are completely undeserved.

        --S:  Speaking of gross personal attacks...!
        --E:  hehe

Furthermore, I find it unnerving that trash like you would be allowed
to publish these unfounded lies about me.  I am a highly respected 
member of the community, and though I am not that terribly involved in
it, I do have a good reputation.

        --S:  (neighbor to police) "He was a quiet man....."  

In closing, I demand a full retraction of all heinous and untruthful
statements that your magazine in this issue published about me.  Take
these filthy lies and shove them where the sun does not shine.

        --E:  I bet he'd like to shove more than that up there.

                                Cordially,
                                            Carlton Smith, Jr.
                                            Sysop: C.C.I. EBBS

                "EXiLED is a new H/P group with a new attitude
        towards information. We want a group that gets along,
        learns constantly, and fights against oppression of the

        learn. EXiLED is about sharing what you know, EXiLED is
        about expanding your mind."

I couldn't agree more with Deadpool and the whole EXiLED bunch.  I share
all of their opinions about freedom of information.  I don't believe that
anyone has the right to hide anything or keep certain information that is
vital to their personal welfare private.  I especially don't believe that
the freedom and right to learn from information should be infringed upon.
This is why, when I mail things, I don't use envelopes and why I don't at
all mind people knowing my real name is (censored). It's also why, when I
use a calling card from a payphone, I'm careful to use a loud voice so as
not to deprive anyone from hearing my full CCN and when I go to the ATM
machine I invite everyone to come and see my PIN number.

Unfortunately, though, what I do have trouble figuring out is EXiLED's use
of aliases.  Perhaps it was only an oversight on their part.  Perhaps they
had no idea that they were being completely hypocritical.

Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps..

In any case, I will endeavour to make up for their error.  Listed handily
under the Various Files menu are the names, addresses, and phone numbers of
some of the more active and prominent EXiLED members.  Don't worry about
questions of ethics or personal privacy.  EXiLED and I completely agree
upon the bounds of the freedom of information.  I'm sure they don't mind my
releasing this file.  After all, it's merely an invokation of that
oh-so-precious right to knowledge.

Please feel free to give any EXiLED member a call and quiz them over any
subject you please.  I'm more than amply confident that they won't refuse
you in your quest for information.

                       Why Memphis area BBS's suck 
                               By Einstein 

For ease of reading and classification purposes, this article is divided
into the following sections:

[1] Why Memphis area message bases suck
[2] Why Memphis area file bases suck
[3] Why Memphis area users suck
[4] Why Memphis area BBS's suck

If this offends you, you're exactly the sort of person I want reading this.

[1] Why Memphis area message bases suck

        This is a widely disputed topic between the users of Memphis.
There are many reasons why the message bases suck around Memphis.  The
first and most important reason is the lack of adequate teaching and
tutelage for new users that are just starting to call Memphis elite boards.
First of all, the definition of the word elite has been corrupted to an
intolerable level, and I'll explain the true meaning in another article in
this magazine.  Anyway, when young Johnny User starts calling boards around
Memphis, all he sees are flames, worthless old information, and more
flames.  There is no sharing of ideas, no intelligent conversation, no
cooperation between users, nothing.  Just arrogant asswipes who tout their
group's accomplishments and their own BBS's eliteness without end and young
users who are intent on asking for files, spreading rumors, or just being
morons.  This simply must stop.  When young Johnny User sees this, it's
only natural for him to emulate those juvenile actions to get attention and
to cement other's opinions of him and his actions.  It took me a year to
get on track, and it was only because of those willing to teach and my
willingness to listen that I in turn benefitted from their guidance. Thanks
Splice.

The way to make message bases better is not just to post. Posting messages
just to post them leads to lame bases which users (especially long distance
users) won't wish to scan through and post in. The basic problem is that
those users who know what they're doing take it upon themselves to hoard
that information and that advice and let young struggling users develop
their own (and almost always incorrect) ideas about what to post and what
to discuss.  My advice is:  share!  Become well acquainted with new users
and their ideas, and be sure to let them know what's up in the scene.  When
they're doing something wrong, let them know about it.  How you let them
know about it is entirely up to you.  But if I might make a suggestion,
viruses work wonders for "all-caps" posters. Also, when you're writing a
message, speak English.  Try to spell everything right and try not to use
extended ASCII.  Don't be cryptic and don't put Z's after everything.  By
the way, the word fun is not spelled "phun".  English use is very important
when trying to get your thoughts through correctly.  Flame wars are lame.
I can't say it enough, just stop that bullshit.  SysOps are actually making
BASES for this garbage. It's hard to believe that users are told that this
is what being 'elite' is about.  Sure, it's easy to fill up a flame base,
but if you really want to flame someone call a FidoNet board and get in on
that.  That should never have found it's way into the underground bases. If
you want revenge on someone or are just tired of their attitude, there are
many other ways to accomplish what you want.  I'm sure you can find
instances of this somewhere else inside this magazine.  Let me put it in
simple terms so that all can understand.  One word can sum up the problem,
the solution, and the methodology of this situation:  intelligence.

[2] Why Memphis area file bases suck

        Don't you hate it when there's nothing new on a board? When you
new-scanned for files you got a blank screen.  Now stop and ask yourself,
if you were a long distance user and you got that sort of response, would
you ever call that board again?  Would you really?  Well, this is the sad
state that many Memphis area local boards are in.  There's no advertising
for long distance users, since no one's calling long distance.  There are
no long distance users, because there's no advertising.  There are no new
files since all the decent files come from long distance, and there are no
decent boards since SysOps never have any new files.  A sad scenario,
wouldn't you say?  I speak as an outsider myself.  I live right outside of
Memphis, but am long distance from Memphis, and from what I've seen Memphis
file bases are almost always dead.  It's not the files that are in short
supply though, it's the good users who don't mind calling long distance to
supply new files.

[3] Why Memphis area users suck

        People in Memphis are just as smart as anywhere else, right? (Well,
yes and no, but that's another article altogether...) So why are Memphis
boards stocked with losers, people that only show up on a userlist and
never a top uploader or message poster screen.  People that are just
"there" for the ride or something.  Stagnant wastes of sperm that stop at
nothing to accomplish nothing and leave no one guessing as to what their
next move will be: logoff.  I have devised two flawless ways to take care
of the problem of users such as this: A handgun and a blacklist menu.  Now,
whichever option you choose, be aware that this person might retaliate in
some way, but don't worry about it too much.  If that person did nothing
while a user on your board, just think of how much less he'll do after he's
kicked off.

[4] Why Memphis area BBS's suck

        Please refer to the previous three parts of this article.  If your
BBS still sucks, it could be software choices or type of board.  By the
way, pirated games/utility boards have -never- lasted in Memphis.  If all
else fails, assume the obvious:  maybe it's just you.

A final note: 

        I would like to say something to all the users reading this and
thinking to themselves, "What a hypocrite".  All I can say to those who
choose not to read this objectively is:  I can see why it's hard for you to
not be objective.

                              The Defined Elite
                                 By Einstein

Elite (i-leet' or a-leet'), n. - the choice or most carefully selected part
                                 of a group, as of a society or profession.
                                 (Source: Webster's Unabridged Dictionary)

                             a. the best or most skilled members of a given
                                social group.
                             b. a small and priviledged group.
                                (American Heritage Second College Edition)

        This word has fallen into disrepair, wouldn't you agree?  Read the
definitions carefully (this may take some time).  Is there anything in what
you just read that refers to selection?  Of course there is.  The
definition states that to be elite, one must be selected.  If one must be
selected, that eliminates all those users who are undeserving.  This
equates to about 90-95 percent of the bbs community in Memphis.  Of
course, we must also consider just who is doing the selecting.  This is
the problem with scene as it now stands.  No one is doing the selecting.
SysOps are all so intent on this freedom business that they let users in 
that are in all actuality undeserving.  Don't get me wrong, freedom is 
great, but it shouldn't get in the way of keeping trash off of a system 
and keeping good callers calling.
        
        The following are some typical qualifiers for discovering those
users who are truly 'elite' and those who aren't:
        
        [1] If a person were truly elite, he wouldn't share pertinent                                       
            information that he himself had gleaned through hacking or
            through some other means.  Shared information is worthless in
            that it's lifetime is significantly cut short and that those  
            with access to it are often not competent enough to use it 
            correctly or with a proper level of caution.
        
        [2] If a person were truly elite, he would not claim eliteness.
            Actions speak louder than words.
        
        [3] Those who try to cajole a sense of pity or sorrow in their
            newuser applications.  If a user really wants onto a system,
            and he is elite, he already has access, whether the SysOp
            knows it or not.  His friends(not to mention his enemies)
            most always provide easy entrance into a system through
            their mistakes and/or their nature.
        
        [4] Elite users are not malicious.  They are well behaved and
            always have an attitude that implies knowledge on a higher
            plane than those around them.  Although this can be mistaken
            for an air of conceit or arrogance, that is most certainly
            not the case.  Elite users always seem to have the knowledge
            others lack, but also foster with that knowledge a deep
            respect for moderation and tolerance that only unveils when
            threatened.
        
        [5] When an elite user is threatened, make no mistake, he will
            use any available means to protect himself.  Don't be
            deceived, however, when a true elite is backed into a corner
            by a threat, he will not cower.  He will use every means at his 
            disposal to effectively ensure his continued safety.  This 
            "take no prisoners" attitude more often than not leaves few 
            standing.
        
        [6] An elite user will never be seen wasting time online. There
            are always better things to do than vegetate at a main menu
            screen for an hour.  Most elite users will scan the message
            base, scan the file base, and logoff before they've spent a
            minute online.  If, for some reason, they decide to post or
            transfer a file, be assured that the message will make sense
            and will address an issue in clear, consise terms with proper
            grammar and that any files downloaded will be accompanied
            with an upload of equal quality.

        This is not a firm definition or an absolute truth, merely a 
guideline to assist those who have never encountered a set, understood
definition of eliteness for users.  If you have a disagreement with my 
findings, I'd love to hear what your opinion is (right..).

                        The Facetious Treatise
                  an editorial from the mind of Splice

          (This article originally appeared in the NuKE Info) 
          (Journal 11 and has been reprinted with permission)

It is a growing trend in the world of computers, and the world in general,
that for one to be accepted into certain cliques, one must be somewhat of a
purveyor of mischief - one must get into trouble.  But perhaps this is only
an assumption ... perhaps really it is a misconception of sorts propagated
by those who do not themselves posses the skills or knowledge to be
accepted among what they wrongly assume to be their peers.  Perhaps these
people think that mere rebelliousness is the qualifer for peer acceptance
in the world of the underground.  And perhaps they're quite wrong.

With the elimination of social complexities, such as duty and virtue,
modern life has come to be guided only by pursuit of pleasure and avoidance
of pain. Thus humans have attained the same natural perfection as wild
beasts - a price has been paid for this honest simplicity though.  Without
the order of conscience or obligations of rectitude to force us into
dangers, our lives are no more thrilling than Patricia "except that it
replicates" Hoffman's.

Real trouble fixes this.

If the lady next door roasts her child - preheating the oven to 550 degrees
and placing the baby, chubby side up, on a rack in an open pan, reducing
the heat immediately to 350 degrees and cooking eighteen to twenty minutes
per pound until dead, numerous thrills are provided.  There is the thrill
of the violent sensation (if you happen to open the oven door yourself).
There is the thrill of importance as you carry the news to others, and the
thrill of creativity as you invent things about your neighbor to tell to
the press. And, most important, there is the ultimate, fabulous, and very
polite thrill of not having given in to the temptation to do this to your
own kid.

But it is the very thrill of not having caused the pandemonium that points
out the one big problem with real trouble:  It's such a bore waiting for
others to get into it.  Waiting goes against the impatient grain of modern
life.  As a result, many people feel compelled to get into real trouble
themselves - even though they know it's going to be a bother.

When you get tired of waiting or sitting on the sidelines and decide to get
into real trouble yourself, you should make sure that it's you who gets
killed or sent to jail.  But etiquette is not as exacting on this point as
it once was.  Today it's often considered acceptable to have lots of people
go to the grave or Leavenworth with you.  You must still be careful about
motive, however.  It shouldn't look as though you -need- to cause trouble
to attract attention.  It's always rude to remind others of inadequacies,
especially your own.  Also, you should never cause trouble out of anger.
If you are mad at someone and you shoot him, real trouble will result.  But
you'll also lose that person's friendship.  The more courteous thing to do
would be to slap him with a huge lawsuit.  That way, you'll enjoy the
trouble and he'll enjoy the publicity.  Thus the wheels of society are
oiled.  You should also never create trouble for a "cause".  Planting pipe
bombs is of course no end of fun, but planting them in order, say, to
promote world peace looks too calculating.  Having a "cause" gives others
food for thought about how empty your life must be otherwise.

Never get into real trouble by accident.  Plane crashes, car wrecks, and
accidents while cleaning guns are all too impromptu for even the casual
social life of today.  People will tell each other, "when something like
that happens there's just nothing you can say."  How true... and how
boring. If you're going to have a surprise mishap, try to be beaten to
death by teen-agers in the restroom of a public park that's known as a
hangout for homosexuals.  This will give everyone lots to say - especially
your wife and kids.  The value of planning cannot be overestimated.  If you
are going to get into real trouble, you should start laying the groundwork
early in life by being quiet, shy, a straight-A student, and a dutiful
child to your parents.  It gives no end of pleasure to everyone when a
person like that throws a flaming bucket of gasoline on the podium at a
CARO meeting.

If you're not killed immediately when you get into real trouble, you'll
have to stand trial.  Think of the jury as your friends.  That way, you'll
be prepared when they fuck you over.  Also, society holds trials for the
same reason that Shakespeare had comic relief in Macbeth - so try to make
everyone laugh.  Pleading innocent is usually the best way of doing this.
And plea-bargaining is tasteless - too much like being engaged in trade.
Finally, dress for a trial in a manner that shows you to be a sophisticated
person.  Use big words and a european accent, but avoid ending sentences
with "per se, yo honor."  You don't want them to know you're faking it,
especially if they'll think you ran your parents through a laundry mangle
out of ignorance and stupidity.  If the jury comes to feel they really know
and understand you, you'll have to spend some time in prison.  Being in
prison is like being a guest at a large house party - except that you'll be
sexually ravished without hints over cocktails first.  If you live in a
state with capital punishment, try to think up something fitting to say
during your lethal injection.  "See you in hell, Mom," is nice, but a tad
overused.  Go for shock value:

-  "Oh my gosh!  There's angels and God and Jesus and pearly gates and St.
    Peter and everything!"  (Memorable if your family is orthodox Jewish)

-  "What a neat swing in that old oak tree!  Hey wait!  Why are you wearing
    a hood?"  (Memorable if your family is black)

-  "Goodbye, Mary!  I love you.  Goodbye."  (Memorable if your wife's name
    is Sue)

-  "Go fuck yourselves, the bunch of you."  (Trite, but you can bet they 
    won't soon forget)

Things like "My only regret is that I have but one life to give for my
country" are too stuffy for what's basically an informal situation.

In summation, those who can handle real trouble are a truly elite few.
There are many who try emulate them, and after publication of this, there
will probably be many more.  One last word of advice to the kids in the
audience who will undoubtedly wish at some point to be accepted:  Don't
commit suicide to get back at your parents if they actually -do- detest
you. You'll just be playing into their hands.

                           An Exercise in Deceit
                                by Splice

When I arrived in Memphis from Chicago about 2 and a half years ago,  I
began calling out to some local boards and getting the feel of Memphis.
I called the usual systems, CCI, USS Enterprise and the like.  I didn't
think that much of Memphis, but because of my employment I was forced to 
move here,  so I was determined to make the best of it.  Unfortunately
for me,  I broke into the local hacker/phreaker scene at about the same 
time that an apparently infamous member of it was making his exit.

Immortus was apparently a moderately well equipped hacker and phreaker,
but one who had quite an attitude.  He frequently changed aliases and 
it was just assumed that when I came along, I was Immortus under yet 
another new name.  I grew very tired of being called Immortus, and even 
more tired of people discriminating against me and even locking me out of
their systems because they thought I was someone who I was not.  I tried
to do everything I could to prove to these people that I was not who they
seemed to think I was, but it proved futile after a short time.  It turned
out that Immortus had been the guy everyone loved to hate, and that I 
had become an extension of that.  I soon found out why.

I called up Immortus near the middle of 1993 after finding out exactly
who he was (and after being totally fed up).  We talked for a few minutes
and he seemed happy to finally meet himself.  It seemed as if he was 
almost glad that his "legend" lived on in the scene through me and that
everyone hated yet subtly feared me because they thought I was him.  He
told me he had not been telling anyone who called him that he was Splice, 
but did say that an enormous number of people did in fact call him and ask.
He also told me why he had dropped out of the scene (supposedly for one
unsuspectedly large phone bill), and then told me that he was getting 
prank called almost twenty four hours a day.  I almost felt sorry for the 
guy... here he was, getting all these calls all because of me.. or was it 
because of him?  In any case, we talked for a little while longer and I 
found out exactly why people were shunning me.  This guy was a major 
asshole.  Nothing I said was correct, linguistically or otherwise, and if
I disagreed with him I got a dissertation on the finer points of whatever
subject we were discussing.  It was like talking to a wall.  He knew the
acronyms and terms of the h/p world, but that was the extent of it.
People had no real reason to fear this guy at all.  The most he could have
done was prank them back and maybe correct their grammar every so often.

Anyway, this all drew to a close after I put up my system, High Voltage, 
near the beginning of 1993, and convinced most everyone but a few die hard 
fanatics that I was who I said I was... talk about trust in the scene. 

In any case, it had been about two years since anyone had accused me of 
being Immortus, when, a few days ago,  after I vowed to destroy the lamer 
boards of this fine city, I was accosted by a sysop, who shall remain 
nameless (Imperial, Robert Hess), of just such a board, which shall also 
remain nameless (Pyrotechnic Suicide).  I was informed as to what my true 
identity was and that, hey, afterall, it was no secret, and everyone knew 
I was Todd.  Needless to say, I was pissed.  I thought that after a year
and a half of being me, everyone might be familiar enough with me to know
and maybe even -trust- me a little bit.  I guess I was wrong.  Following
below are the actual message exchanges between me and Imperial which 
occurred in e-mail on a local 901 system called The Nucleus:

Frankly, you are not the first to chomp on the little bit... it's an
interesting theory - one worth actual merit if only it were correct.
you are however the first person to chomp on that bit who's named robert/paul
hess.. forgive me, i cannot as of yet distinguish between you and your
father..  however, you do have an assuredly nice house in the hills on the
quiet little street of olivia.. nice fixed rate FHA loan too if i might add..
and, just out of curiousity, why would you possibly think that by may saying I
was going to eliminate "k-rad lamer boards" and the like, that that meant you?
nevermind.. dumb question.

NuKE is the premier virus development group currently in existence.
It has surpassed Phalcon/Skism, ARCV, etc..  NuKE is responsible for such 
items as Virus Creation Laboratory, the NuKE Utils, the NuKE Encryption
Device (similar to MtE), NuKE InfoJournals, and scores and scores of other
irregular items...  The latest release is the MBC (Metric Buttload of 
Code generator), a virus production kit which will create an infinite 
number of strains all inherently different.   We are no fly by night flame 
war ansi/anarchy group.

As per your affil, it is local, but affiliations mean nothing.  Just 
because I am in NuKE means nothing at all about me...  NuKE has members 
on every continent including both poles... has nothing to do with me 
personally though..

As per your board, and trying to crash it:  Trust me my esteemed Quiver
running friend..  Your sense of security is false.

Oh no.. I don't resort to violence my friend..
And judging by the fact that you are still calling me todd, if i did
resort to violence i'm sure i'd have to give you some schematics beforehand 
to explain things...  grow up and find a new information source..
I haven't heard this todd shit since the middle of '93 and I'm not going

My very last letter was not replied to, and gladly so.  I feel almost 
ashamed for carrying on the conversation as long as I did and not just 
ignoring the guy completely.  I should have cut off this lame "meet me at 
the hah" type of messaging before it got started.  I blame myself for that, 
but my overall cheery nature won me over in the end.  For more information

My cheery nature exhausted, I didn't reply.  I was, however, reminded 
of something that Alexander Pope once said... "A little learning is a 
dangerous thing."  Obviously, Imperial has learned very little.  Read 
about how I learned him a thing or three in the articles section under 
the heading "The Last Imperor".

                                                -Splice

===========================================================================

                                The Last Imperor
                          The Embodiment of Ignorance

Note:  To understand the motivation for this malicious attack upon Imperial
and his ex-system, Pyrotechnic Suicide, please read the editorial entitled
"An Exercise in Deceit" contained earlier in this magazine.

===========================================================================

The first strike against Imperial's chance of survival was that he ran a
completely unsecure and backdoor filled software such as QUiVER.  The 
second and more useful strike he had against him was that he was a complete
and total idiot.  This made things much easier for me.

The first thing I did was to acquire an account on his system with moderate
access.  This was done quite easily, as not one question was asked of me 
other than those on the pre-fabricated generic infoforms which came with
the software.  You know the ones, "Define THG:", the really hack/phreak
type infoforms. 

The second thing I did was to list his users and find out which ones had
adequate access to be able to enter the sysop menu.  This was quite easy
as Pyrotechnic Suicide and its users are more than happy to answer any 
and all questions you may throw at them.  After finding an account with
sysop access, I made use of a little known login password proprietary to
that wonderful QUiVER software.  Unfortunately for me, or fortunately
depending on how you look at it, the sysop was home at the time I did this.
He really made it hard for me and all, supplying the sysop menu password
only after I explained to him how my "mom threw my password list away".

The account I had chosen to use, Seventh Son, also known as Wes Talbert,
was an especially good choice on my part.  After Imperial spent about
5 minutes or so telling me how connected that "I" was, he offered to let
me join EXiLED - or begged me to rather.  I somewhat grudgingly agreed,
saying that it would be ok, but that I would be giving up a very 
senior position in RUSH to become a very junior member in EXiLED.  This
is when he offered to alter the circle of power in EXiLED.  Instead of
the leadership triumvirate consisting of Deadpool, Imperial, and Aux 1,
he offered to, with the help of Deadpool, change that consistency to
Deadpool, Imperial, and Seventh Son.  It came to me as quite a surprise
that Aux 1, who is in my opinion the only EXiLED member who has ANY clue,
would be removed from his senior position and demoted to floor scrubber
simply because Seventh Son, who is mainly known as a wares pup anarchy
boy, wanted to join the group.  In any case, I was informed as to all
of the neat-o beat-o tricks of EXiLED and told about this devious
little device called the Shadowbox which is "really, man, fuckin awesome".
Unfortunately, no one seems to know exactly what the box does or how to 
make or get one yet, including all of the EXiLED members who supposedly 
created it (to see actual schematics stolen from EXiLED on the Shadowbox, 
look under the Various Files section).

Now, after chatting with him for about 45 minutes, and leaving him 
thoroughly convinced that I was who I said I was, I offered him a piece
of software, Thunderbyte Anti-Virus Professional, which he had requested
in a message on his board.  He said he would very much like to have this
software, and being the congenial person that I am, I provided it to him.
I also inquired as to what current virus protection he used, and he was
glad to inform me that he used F-Protect and TBAV TSRs.  I suddenly 
remembered that when I installed TBAV Pro on my system for the first time,
it found itself and another TSR virus scanner in memory and messed up two
directories on my hard drive.  Of course, I wouldn't want this to happen
to him, so being the nice guy that I am, I made sure that he would remove
all TSR virus scanners from memory before running TBAV Pro.  After he
thanked me profusely for this bit of information, I decided that it was
the appropriate time for me to end this call - especially in light of the
fact that he was so anxious to install TBAV.

I called back approximately 30 minutes later to find the board still 
functioning properly.  Needless to say, I was a bit upset, but I figured 
that I would try to make the best of it.  The first thing I did was to 
page him for a chat to ascertain whether or not he was sitting there 
watching every move I made.  He had previously entered chat after I paged
him about .0001ms after I hit enter.  This time, he didn't answer.  I was
confident that he was not there, so I conveniently made my way to the 
sysop menu, using the password which he had so kindly provided to his 
"trusted cosysop", and proceeded to capture his user files.  After this
was done, I noticed a command which said "Directory Editor".  Well..
Whaddya know kids.  This was actually a file sub editor which allowed me
to change the file area pathnames.  After downloading his actual user
files, his personal BBS registration, and a few other choice financial
records from what was presumably his father's Lotus program,  he caught
me trying to download his terminate phone directory.   He interrupted me,
broke into chat, and this time it took me a good 2 whole minutes to 
convince him that, hey, I was just checking out his security for him.
He did get a little suspicious and ask me for his girlfriend's first name,
but since I had just stolen his user files, which she was in, it was no
trouble at all pacifying him.  He let me proceed with a warning not to
download any other personal files that he had.  Of course I agreed and
continued downloading his terminate directory.  He interrupted the 
transfer once again, and said "hey, I said stop that!".  I gave up with
the terminate directory,  and deleted it while he watched.  I don't think
he was aware at this point that I had already downloaded about 20 other
files including his telix phone directory.  I made some lame excuse 
about needing to go get something to eat, and he wished his newest
EXiLED affiliate a good night.

Approximately 4 hours later, after telling everyone I knew what a total
idiot Imperial was, and how he was going to die soon, I called his system
back.  He answered, but was in terminal mode.  Seems as though he was 
dialing out to find some sort of quiver utility to fix a userbase.  It
seems someone had deleted his.  He informed me that he saw in the log
where I had downloaded his user files and asked me to please re-upload
them.  He didn't seem upset about this at all, as I was one of his EXiLED
brothers, not to mention a co-sysop.  Little did he know.  He also asked
me if I could check the ZIP file I uploaded to him with TBAV in it and
see if it had any errors.. When I inquired as to why, he told me that when
he had run it, it gave him some sort of memory error (the string which is 
displayed upon running the first virus).  I said, whoa, wait a minute.
My zip was corrupted.  Let me send you that TBAVPRO.COM file over again.
I did, he ran it, and the rest is history.  I guess the second virus worked
a little faster than the first...

==============================================================================

This is the actual transcript of the ensuing conversation between Splice and
his royal, and emotionally distraught, hindass Imperial that took place the
day after:

Splice:    Yo Bobby?
Imperial:  hey...
Splice:    Hey this is Splice.. I mean, uhh... Seventh son.. hey man what's 
           up?
Imperial:  yeah whatever.. <sniffle sniffle>
Splice:    So how'd ya get virused little buddy?
Imperial:  well i don't know... it's all gone.. <sob> ..all fucked up.. 
Splice:    well.. <sarcasm> you know I'm Immortus don't you?  I mean you can 
           retaliate and all.... hehehe..
Imperial:  <with sincerity> yeah I know...
Splice:    you can come brick my house or something.. whatever you like, hehe!
Imperial:  No we don't resort to senseless violence <tear falls from cheek>
Splice:    oh ok then you'll be interested to hear that your financial 
           records that were in your lotus directory are safe and sound...
Imperial:  yeah sure.. <sniff>
Splice:    All those wordperfect files were interesting reading also..
Imperial:  that directory wasn't even there man..
Splice:    if you say so.. anyway, would you like me to give brandon a
           copy of the capture of you offering Seventh Son Aux 1's EXiLED 
           position or would you like to do it yourself?
Imperial:  whatever man...
Splice:    HEY MAN!  GET ME ONE OF THOSE COOL SHADOWBOXES! THEY'RE AWESOME!

                             How to be Apathetic
                                 by Einstein

        In this article, I will attempt to show by word and example just
exactly how you too can learn and enjoy that great institution we call
apathy.  Just a side note: If you've read any of my previous articles, you 
probably should have noticed by now that I'm not politically correct.  
He/man/mankind will always suffice when writing a paper.  If you need more 
proof, think about the many women hackers of the past.  Well, that didn't 
take long, did it.  As always, this is my opinion, so you can rehash and 
argue about this all you want. The fact is, I don't care.
        There are a few patented ways to act apathetic, those being the
use of apathetic phrases, apathetic punctuation, and apathetic actions.
The first step is learning the lingo of people who really don't care.  
Now it really doesn't matter if in truth you care or not.  The point is to 
make the person you're talking to believe that you don't care one iota 
about a word he's saying.
        
                              Apathetic Phrases        

        Here are some of the typical phrases used by apathetic people.
Write these down and remember them.  They are listed as the top ten most
frequently used phrases between Splice and me.  Follow the example.  Let
us show you the way.

The Top Ten Apathetic Phrases

1.   "whatever" - recognized as the global apathetic response
2.   "nevermind" - always a crowd pleaser
3.   "I couldn't care less" - a close third
4.   "I don't care" - the obvious choice
5.   "do you know how little I care?" - a useful retort
6.   "hey. I care. no... really!" - the facetious response
7.   "yeah, sure" - yet another sarcastic barb
8.   "I care about that about as much as I care about you" - insulting, too
9.   "uh huh, yeah, go on" - the bell operator response
10.  "who gives a shit?" - Splice's favorite

        As you can see from the listing, "whatever" ranks highest among all
apathetic phrases.  This is partly because of it's usefulness, but also
because it has the added bonus of pissing off the person you're talking to.  
"Whatever" doesn't care about your socio-economic background, your ethnicity,
your color (this is debatable, niggers care about everything these days), 
your religion (preferably Christian, but believe it or not, the most 
demented minds are formed from Christian doctrine and schools), your sexual 
orientation (well, except for fags, lesbians, and bisexuals that is.), your
status in society or your arrest record.  "Whatever" can and does work for us
all, so remember, no matter the question, the answer can and should be 
"whatever".
        The other phrases rank high also. This list can go for miles,
down to answers to specific questions.  For size purposes(and because I
really don't care), I cut the list off at ten.  Incidentally, the responses
"I don't give a rat's ass" and "ohwell" were also quite popular, but failed
to make the top ten.
                                 
                            Apathetic Punctuation
        
        Punctuation is one of the greatest gifts an apathetic person could
give.  Perhaps this is because he hardly ever uses it.  The next section 
refers to the sort of punctuation practices only an apathetic person would 
partake in.  I have decided to write my articles in this magazine with 
correct punctuation, at great pain and effort to me personally.  These 
punctuation nuances are not listed in any order.

Ellipses(...):  An apathetic person uses ellipses to complete a thought.  
                Now let me stress that the number of periods an apathetic
                person uses is usually two or sometimes three, never
                eighteen or twenty-nine.  If you want to see ellipses used
                to extreme, call Neon Sins sometime and chat with Chris.
                (I didn't say this would be easy did I?)

Capitalization: Ah, capitalization.  Used for the simple purpose of..
                Wait.  What is the purpose of capitalization, and does it
                matter?  The apathetic person answers with a somewhat
                resounding "no" and shows it in his messages.  If used at
                all, the capitalization an apathetic person uses is sparse
                and used for inflection.

Typographical:  Spell correctly.  If you must misspell for apathetic
                purposes, make sure it looks like a typo.  Feel free to 
                make many typos and ensure that you don't fix them, for 
                that would imply that you care about the person you're 
                writing to, and we can't have that now can we?

Big Words:      <consult splice, destined to be a knock against chris,
                 filled with odious, corpulent, and languid phrases>

                              Apathetic Actions

        Well, now that you have the lingo down, let's focus on some 
particular actions that convey a sense of apathy to those around you.
These are listed, again, in no order.

Lying:          Tell a lie, stop right in the middle and say "oh, 
                nevermind, I was lying". This stops any enjoyment from 
                your story reaching the listener, and provides you with
                a gateway into future enjoyment to the chagrin and torment 
                of your friend(enemy).

Cheating:       Let people cheat off of your paper. Who cares, you can't 
                legally get punished for this, simply because they're
                looking at what's written on your paper. Feign ignorance,
                or if you're an EXiLED member just act normally.

Stealing:       Stealing is bad form.  There is too much effort involved
                in contemplation of the crime, the action itself, and
                covering up afterwards for this to be a true apathetic
                action.  On the other hand, let other people steal for 
                you.  This is much more in line with apathetic teaching,
                and saves you the trouble of lying to an authority to
                redeem yourself.

Talking:        If a person can't hear you while on the phone, never repeat
                a word you say.  Always make use of "nevermind", and when
                they begin to question your obstinacy, give in.  Of 
                course, make sure you're telling them a different story.
                Also, use the apathetic phrases listed earlier in this 
                article.

        Apathetic people are most often perfectionists.  Since they don't
really care about what they're doing, what they accomplish is usually much
better than what others do.  It is not known why this is so, but it is a
secret that you too can tap into.  All you need do is stop caring and
embrace the apathy.

     Inside the Vindictive Mind and other Bedtime Stories for Children
===========================================================================

There is no greater feeling of pleasure than that gained through the act of
vengeance.  Whether you have just destroyed the cause of all your troubles,
or have become the source of someone elses, remember that revenge is, not
unlike cocaine, an addictive drug.  Once you start, it's very hard to stop.

Soon you will be assaulting the woman in the checkout line who refuses to
begin writing out her check until every item has been rung up.  And you
will find it very hard to keep yourself from dialing the White House
switchboard and in a serious manner warning Clinton "not to go to Dallas"
when you find out what he REALLY made on Whitewater.

Only then will you truly understand what a driving and motivational force
revenge can be.  It makes you do things that normally you would not even
consider doing - and it makes you enjoy them, too.

There are two main types of revenge:  Psychological and Physical.

Psychological revenge is that which is done to thwart the comfortable state
of mind of the target.  The target should be aware that some force is
actively working against him, but he should not be able to discern from
whence it is coming.  Anything that will cause the person to be uneasy or
cause him to be extra careful or paranoid is fitting for this category. In
my experience, I have found that such simple things as a blank piece of
ordinary paper being slid under the door of a target on a random basis is
well suited to cause them much mental anguish - especially if this person
is already involved in some less-than-legal transactions or other
practices.  There are many ways for this message to be translated, but
commonly the target will mentally equate the blank message with whatever it
is that he fears the most.  Combining the blank paper trick with some late
night wrong numbers or mysterious cars in the neighborhood will work
absolute wonders for wrecking the higher brain functions of a target and
riddling him with obsequiousness and caution.  Another way to cause
confusion and worry in a target is a bit more sardonic.  If you happen to
have the fortune of a target who has recently had a death in his close
family, sending black wreaths or "get well" messages from the recently
deceased to your target causes much apprehension.  My personal favorite
message to send is "wishing you were here".  Another way of interrupting a
person's capacity for lucid thought is to use their own pet against them.
Dogs really hate high pitched sounds and usually howl or at least bark when
they hear them.  Take a field trip to your local Radio Shack and make your
own small tone emitting device.  Be sure to get a crystal with a range
between about 14,000 to 20,000hz.  Once placed inside the target's house,
it will provide no end of fun, what with all the incessant barking and
those late night trips to the vet, just to make sure Bowser is really "ok".

Physical revenge presents a much greater element of danger to the active
participant.  You cannot hide behind paper or electronics when doing this
and must, at some point at least, expose yourself to some risk.  Physical
revenge does not necessarily mean that you beat someone up (though that is
no end of fun).  Physical revenge does mean that you cause bodily harm to
the target,  but no real personal contact is necessary for this to take
place.  For example, everyone has at some point in their lives placed an
upturned push-pin in someone elses seat.  Take this line of tactical
thinking a bit further.  Place a small dry-cell battery behind someone's
toilet and run two wires into the bowl.  You may either paint them white,
or run them into the back (covered) part of the toilet, making sure that
they both come in contact with the water.  Though rather crude and a bit
cruel, this method does work exceptionally well and provides hours of
entertainment and fun especially if installed in a public restroom or other
such place where your target (and many others) will frequent it.  This
method is also compatible with ANY target as relieving themselves is
probably one of the only constants in their lives.  Another devious and
more dangerous thing to do if you intend extreme physical harm, or even
fatality,  is to kindly make sure that your target's brake fluid is not
dirty or anything.  I'm sure the target would be upset if after driving for
two or three hours until his gas ran out (or he hit a small Mack truck), it
turned out that his brake fluid was grimy.  The only way I have figured out
to do keep this nasty affair from happening so far is just to drain it all
out.  Forgetting to put it back in or anything would be just too cruel for
even me.


This just about covers revenge and vindictiveness.  This article is by no
means all-encompassing and merely points out a few examples of the two
major ways of getting even.  In your endeavours, by all means try if at all
possible to be original.  Experiment with new things and ideas, and try to
find new ways to accomplish the same goals laid out earlier in this
article.  I will, however, lay out a few ground rules for your
experimentation.  These are for your own general safety:

Rule 1.  
        Never fight an inanimate object.  Also known as 'The Drunk Rule'.

Rule 2. 
        Never hit anyone below the belt, especially a black one earned in
        karate.

Rule 3. 
        Never try to break the end off a bottle if it's plastic or 
        disposable.

Rule 4. 
        Never hit anyone from behind.  People should be _kicked_ from
        behind.

Rule 5. 
        Remember... It's a form of social climbing to hit anyone bigger
        than you.

Rule 6. 
        When your opponent is down, never kick him in the teeth with your
        tennis shoes.  (Use riding boots)

Rule 7. 
        You should never point a loaded gun at anyone.  (This is not an
        absolutely rigid rule.  An absolutely rigid rule is:  Never, ever,
        point an _unloaded_ gun at anyone.)

                             How to crash a board
                                 By Einstein

This article is divided into sections, those being:

        [1]  General board crashing tips
        [2]  How to crash a public domain board
        [3]  How to crash a lame underground board
        [4]  How to crash a borderline public domain/underground board

        No, this is not for information purposes only.  This is for the 
sole purpose of taking down a board, for whatever reason you may have.  
Before you're sure you want to take someone down, make sure you're doing 
it for the right reasons.  It's best not to be capricious when dealing 
with these idiots.  Formulate your own opinion and go from there.
        
        [1]  General board crashing tips        

        First, let me go into some general tips to help.  I suppose I 
should address this oh so important issue to crashers.  The insurgence of
caller identification as a valid security measure is a joke in itself.  Ask
yourself, seriously, what this sysop is going to do even if he has your
phone number and registered operator name?  I suppose he can just call the 
residence and try to harass you, but if you haven't figured it out yet, 
it's completely within your rights to get Telco on this one and get the 
sysop trapped with a harassing phone call charge.  And what should you do 
if the system operator is within his senses when he calls you?  Feign 
ignorance.  Tell him you don't have a computer and have not the slightest 
idea what he's talking about.  Sure, the sysop could call the authorities.  
And do what?  Tell them that he ran a file a user gave to him that happened 
to have destructive code in it?  What do you think the Memphis Police 
Department would(could) do, if anything, in the event of such a complaint.  
You guessed it: nothing.  Basically, what I'm trying to say is: if you can 
get the sysop to crash himself then you can't be held at fault, unless you 
admit to it.  Remember, in these cases, who's really the "hacker"?  The 
sysop of course.  If he runs the file, then it's his own business and you 
have nothing to worry about.
        
        Now there are some out there that are reading this and exclaiming:
"This is not hacking!"  Well, yes and no.  Ask yourself: if a virus crashes
a system, does it really matter if you did or didn't use a backdoor in the
software to implant it?  Of course not.  This article is about board 
crashing, not board hacking.  Board hacking is basically a thing of the 
past, with a few exceptions.  If someone wants to take down a board, there
should be no options closed to him.  Viruses work.  They always have and
probably always will work.  As long as you're dealing with human being
sysops, you can't go wrong.  Well let me rephrase that.  If you know what
you're doing, you can't go wrong.

        [2] How to crash a public domain board

        This is usually the easiest system to crash, and almost always 
harbors a trusting if not completely moronic system operator.  First of 
all, either create a fake account or use someone else's to get on.  Once 
you're on, act as normally as you would on any other, with one exception.  
Make sure you page the sysop and chat with him for a few minutes every day 
or two.  Most of these people haven't been out of their houses since age 
18, so you should have no problem getting this person to become "friends" 
with you.  If, while in chat, the sysop wants to break in for a voice 
talk, go for it!  That's the best way to gather information: to firmly 
associate in the sysop's mind a user's name and human voice. 
        
        Assume any identity you're good at for this phase of the plan, 
but try to adapt your identity to one fitting the general need or idea 
of the board you are trying to crash.  For example, to crash a graphics 
oriented system, you would become the biggest, baddest, and bestest GIF 
trader on this side of the Mississippi.  No, really.  If the sysop
happens to have posted a message requesting some certain type of file,
be helpful.  Share with the class and dutifully upload that file, or
a reasonable facsimile of such (read: replaced executable), to the 
sysop.  He'll appreciate it, and you will too in the long run.
        
        If the sysop has never before been crashed, you'll probably have no 
need for any social engineering skills whatsoever.  I'm sure you can think 
of some executables that people will run from public domain boards.  Public 
domain games, BBS Utilities and programs, Anti-Virus utilities(heh), 
Hypertext Documentation, programming files; these are just some ideas for 
potential droppers; these all work nicely.
        
        It doesn't really matter, just ensure that it has a dropper inside.
If you've found that the sysop won't run it for fear of viruses, get him in
chat and convince him! And whatever you do, don't hang up after he's run
it.  Try to fix the problem for him(yeah, sure) or find some way to keep
yourself on the line.  If after he runs the file, it returns to the
command prompt, tell him you forgot a file and upload another COM "loader"
file(only for really malicious users indeed).
        
        Well, in any case, he's infected, mission accomplished.  Almost.
Make sure you get the dropper around; I mean, really cover the area.  Try
to get accounts that use the same password everywhere(people are out there
that still do this) and cover their dialing directory with the dropper.
You never know which one you'll crash.

        [3]  How to crash a lame underground board

        Since almost all underground boards in Memphis are lame anyway,
this section should probably cover them as well.  The procedure in 
crashing an underground board is basically the same, save one aspect.
Don't annoy the sysop with chat pages, turn instead to his message bases
or his file sections.  Upload some good files.  Post some messages.  Start
some activity on his system, then just sit back and watch him worship the
ground you walk on.  Take advantage of it, and upload your virus then.
It's amazing how these "elite" sysops squirm when their "secure" systems
have been breached and conquered.  Sometimes you can actually help these
poor sysops get some real security.  Tell them that they have a backdoor
hole in their software and they'll never be quite sure whether you're lying
or telling the truth.  The paranoia sometimes runs so deep that they switch
softwares, hopefully to one which will have a backdoor.  Don't waste time
uploading fake wares unless it's a true wares addiction board.  Small 
"philes" always work better and save you time.

        [4]  How to crash a borderline public domain/underground board

        This is where your judgment comes in.  You have to decide whether
you want to take the first or the second approach to crashing the system.
Whichever you choose, this _is_ the place to upload the fake wares, since
in most cases the users on here with access to wares are losers. Here also
the sysops are more akin to public domain sysops with the intention of 
covering their wares and their asses.  So where should I start?  If you
need a testing ground for your crashing skills, get onto the Chessboard at
901-854-2561.  I don't have a grudge against him or anything, but it's sad 
to see someone try to cover their wares with a public domain system.

        In summation, board crashing is very rewarding with little if any
effort.  If you know how to get away with it, crashing can provide an
exciting release from the humdrum patterns of everyday life.  There's
nothing lame about crashing a system for a good reason, remember that.

                An Interview with CyberTron of CyberReality
===========================================================================

        This interviewee also took alot of convincing and harrasing
        to answer these questions.. In retrospect, we find him to be

       A Slightly Inebriated Interview With DarkStar of The Nucleus
===========================================================================

Q:  How did you come up with the name DarkStar?
A:  Well, that will take a lot of explaining. The song by the same name
    really had NOTHING to do with it. I hate songs, per se, so the song
    merely irritated me. I used that name/handle in my younger days as my
    "street name" , back before street names became the rage with the folks
    on the street. I used to make really good grades in school, but since I
    was the "black sheep" of the family, I took the alias Darkstar as a
    payback type of thing. My first handle was Casanova, since I had
    numerous girlfriends. That got old and I changed it to make up for my
    lack of steady pussy.

Q:  Why did you name your system the Nucleus?
A:  Actually, I was thinking about names for BBS's and thought Nucleus
    would fit the theme of my board.  That being, free BBS software for
    all. I did run a board for folks who wanted to have their own BBS, but
    were tired of Remote Access and Wildcat. Those softwares, while filling
    a need, were not quite what I envisioned BBSing should be... Nucleus
    provided an easy alternative to RA or Wildcat. Kind of like the "center
    of the BBS world".


Q:  What do you think about Memphis?
A:  I have lived in Memphis for a total of seven (7) years. The first few,
    say six (6) were when I went to school here for electronic training at
    State Tech. That training got me a job offer from a Dallas Electronics
    Firm and I spent the next 12 and a half years there. I was working for
    a major defense contractor there, and with the 1990 outbreak of "world
    peace" , I found myself laid off, as did so many other people. I went
    back to school to try to redefine my qualifications, but in the long
    run, I just spent time doing what I had been doing for the last ten
    (10) years for credit. Memphis has not really changed much since I have
    returned. The scene here was real shakey forever, and with the
    demise/loss of the few (3) decent boards from the 1980's, the place has
    gone "down the proverbial tubes". Every now and then a new board goes
    up, we can only hope it is a good one.

Q:  How long have you been in Memphis?
A:  See the above answer...

Q:  What do you think the best board in Memphis is, PD or otherwise?
A:  Defining the "best" BBS in Memphis, or anywhere for that matter, is
    hard. "BEST" is such a subjective term. WareZpups, those folks to which
    stealing software is their life, prefer boards with stolen software on
    them. For those who do not deal with underground activities, or are not
    aware of such activities, there are several boards that may make their
    day. I am not in the position of recommending boards for folks to call.
    Adult boards, those that have grabbed the headlines in the recent
    papers, are sad situations. I may detail my thoughts on such
    enterprises in a later issue. PD, (public domain) boards are what the
    average user sees and finds, whether through the MBBS listing, or from
    grabbing their friends calling list. They serve a purpose, albeit a
    pedestrian one.


Q:  How many Memphians does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
A:  It depends if you can get Memphians to agree the light bulb needs
    screwing...


Q:  What is the average tone, in mhz, of the average h/p user's voice in 
    Memphis?
A:  Very high, that means he, and it is usually a young male, hasn't
    reached puberty ...YET. "Hey Darsktar, I just got the latest release of
    BlueBeep!" says the voice at the end of the line.

Q:  What type of user do you look for?
A:  Really I prefer users that are trying to learn about computers and
    BBSing. WaresPups, while at times annoying, are basically just
    beginners who find the trading of stolen software, thrilling or Kewl.
    It may land them or their parents in jail. Young people seem to believe
    they are immune to such petty considerations as the law. Users come in
    several distinct types:
    1) Novice/Rookie type, "Gee, look at the cool thing I can do with my
    computer..." The modem has freed the novice from his/her wordprocessor
    and allowed their phone bill to skyrocket...once they realize they can
    also make Long Distance calls as easily as local ones.
    2) WaresPups types, rookies that have discovered the world of pirated
    software. They are envisioning themselves as modern day Bluebeards,
    sailing the seas of cyberspace in search of booty.
    3) Lonely Hearts types, looking for love in all the wrong places.
    BBS's often provide an attractive place to flirt with members of the
    opposite sex, or the same sex for that matter. Handles or aliases allow
    folks to act out fantasy roles. These folks are in reality, just
    pathetic.
    4) Corporate User type, These poor folks are destined to cruise the
    Internet desperately searching for the latest upgrade/bugfix to that
    wonderful piece of shit that their boss shelled out MEGA bucks for,
    only to find it did not work as they thought it would. Sad but true.
    5) SYSOP types, these folks call around to see what all the other
    SYSOPs are doing with their boards. They are looking for fresh ideas to
    steal. I myself, do this regularly. Unfortunately, Wildcat SYSOPS have
    a great deal of trouble doing anything creative with their software. RA
    is only slightly better in the configurability aspect. The
    Telegard/WWIV hack boards offer the SYSOPs and users better choices for
    making their boards look different.
    6) Police and Law Enforcement types, generally losers who are incapable
    of stopping violent crime on the streets, so they enter other peoples
    homes or businesses via the modem and look for something that can be
    construed to be a crime. If no criminal activity is found, these type
    users often instigate criminal activity to justify their existance.
    This process is called entrapment.



Q:  What do you specialize in?
A:  No specialities...merely generalizations...why confine one's self?

Q:  Do you program at all?  If so, in what languages?
A:  I try to avoid ALL programming. The phrase goes like this..."Strong
    typing is for weak minds" , and I agree with that assessment. I used to
    program, on the old Commodore computers, then the IBM (Inferior But
    Marketable) Mainframes. In the infamous JCL...Why bother? Now I use
    TOOLS that others with real programming ability create. Reinventing the
    wheel is tedious and quite pointless. (PASCAL, BASIC, ATLAS, RPG,
    ASSEMBLER)



Q:  What programs have you written?
A:  None...period. Well, except when I was forced to write them, say for a
    job or a grade.


Q:  How do you feel about pirated files?
A:  I vote for Mongo! I vote for Cindy Crawford! I voted for Perot! See
    what THAT got me? Pirated files are basically stolen. How would you
    like to write the great American Novel, and publish only one copy? You
    want to sell millions of copies to line your pockets with money, but
    no, some geek with a Xerox machine buys your only copy and proceeds to
    copy the shit out of it and then gives it away to everyone for free.
    Bet that would chap your hide a tad. Pirated software is just like
    that.

Q:  How do you feel about pornography?
A:  How many ways can you photograph a Volkswagen? I think if folks want to
    look at that stuff, let them. Just leave the kiddie stuff out. Taking
    advantage of young kids needs to be a death penalty offense. Period.

Q:  Why do you run Insanity?
A:  Because it sucks and pisses PD types off bigger that shit when they hit
    the new user infoforms. Sometimes I use a new user password, just to
    piss folks off a bit more. Not knowing the NUP becomes a challenge to
    some people. These folks call back repetitively trying to guess the
    password. That makes for great fun. Cheaper than renting a video and
    lots more entertaining.

Q:  What do you think about AntiVirus Software and their creators?
A:  It gives them something to do with their lives, and keeps giving those
    who write viruses a reason to keep improving their product.

Q:  What's the best board you call?
A:  (800) PRI-VATE  Toll free!

Q:  What do you think of local sysops?
A:  Some suck, the rest are O.K.   Well, maybe I lied...

Q:  What's your favorite type of file?
A:  Files that actually do SOMETHING useful are my favorite ones, PD or
    SHAREWARE can be my favorite files. Those that a person or corporation
    pay a bunch of money for and later find out the program doesn't do what
    it claimed to do ...they suck. I really prefer files that deliver what
    they promise...hell, I even REGISTER some of them...GASP!

Q:  Do you have any plans for the future?
A:  I plan to live as long as I can , and cause trouble for anyone who
    supports abridgements of our freedoms, as laid out in the Constitution
    of our Republic... Political reform would be a nice objective.


Q:  Anything else you'd like to say to our readers?
A:  If you are reading this, you are already part of the movement to make
    information a public thing. Register to vote, then DO IT. My motto is
    "If you RECOGNISE THE NAME...THEN THEY ARE THE ONES TO BLAME". Vote
    incumbents OUT and vote for term limitations. Kill all bills that
    resemble the "Clipper chip" fiasco. More importantly, beer and alcohol
    need to be sold on Sunday ALL day long. Burger joints need to be
    required to sell burgers at any time they are open for business. It is
    a real bitch to walk into Burger King at 9 AM and not be able to get a
    burger!  "I am sorry Sir, but we are serving breakfast until 10:30 AM,
    no burgers are avaiable at this time" These are BURGER places, they
    should serve burgers. Period.

An Interview with Imperial of EXiLED - Done After Splice's Visit to His BBS
===========================================================================
   -S:  Denotes a comment by Splice    -E:  Denotes a comment by Einstein
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Imperial was very hospitable, possibly out of fear, or maybe
        even out of ... fear.  In any case, he cooperated with me and
        for this I thank him.  The slate has been wiped clean, for now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:  How did you come by the name Imperial?
A:  I saw it sitting on a disk that said Imperial Conquest. 
    It sounded cool.

Q:  How did you come by the name Pyrotechnic Suicide for your board?
A:  It was half my idea and half Neuro's.. I'm a pyro and he's
    depressed..

        -E:  I think you mean you're a flamer, and he's depressing.

A:  About six months now I guess...

        -S:  It shows.

A:  Aux 1 - He's just a nice guy.  He knows what he's talking about.

        -E:  Yeah.... Only when he's talking about body piercing..
        -S:  True.. but only when you can understand what the hell he's 
             trying to say:  "thanyone thwanna thgo thwith thme thto
             thsix thone thsix??"

    which most Bell Operating Companies are currently undergoing?
A:  I really don't know anything about it.

        -E:  No surprise here..

Q:  What exactly is a ShadowBox and how did EXiLED come up with the idea
    for it?
A:  ShadowMasters idea, like a gold box with tone recognition.  
    ShadowMaster used it to get into EXiLED.  I've seen them work.
    You put them in anywhere in a box and connect them to two lines,
    then call them up and enter a 4 digit code in 5 secs or so and 
    and then it kicks you over to the second line's dialtone...

        -S:  Yeah.. you mean a hold button..
        -E:  No, no, no... I know what he's talking about.. It's one 
             of those cool boxes that condenses the air when the person 
             picks up the phone and causes them to have a seizure..

Q:  Is there anything else you'd like to let our readers know?  Take into
    consideration that this may be the only electronic communication which
    you make for a long time.
A:  Nothin much...

Q:  How does it feel to be crashed by someone whom you taunted?
A:  Not very good...

Q:  I've got a pretty clear capture of it...?
A:  uhh... you just misunderstood it..

        -S:  damned rackoons..
        -E:  The Chat Capture Encryption Algorithm Strikes Again..

A:  Umm.. It's the only one TBAV caught...?

        -S:  Guess the number of viruses Imperial has - win a yellow mustang!

Q:  What has it done to your system?
A:  It killed alot of EXEs and I haven't found most everything that was
    damaged yet..

        -S:  Oh isn't he just the Master of Understatement.
        -E:  Just look for things that are undamaged.. there's less to
             find.

Q:  Why did you originally taunt me and prompt me to do this?
A:  We were getting flak from other people... they were just laughing at
    EXiLED and I got tired of it...

        -E:  Even after they released that cool RA key from Emerling?

Q:  Do you still think its smart to do that?
A:  No... I don't..

Q:  Have you learned a little respect for your elder hackers?
A:  Oh yes, definately.

        -S:  Ok.. so we made this one up...

A:  No.. not at all... not anymore.. 

        -E:  Wait just a minute!  What do you mean Splice isn't Immortus?!
        -S:  <smack>

Q:  What finally convinced you?
A:  I didn't have hard proof, I kinda made claims of my own and
    repeated the ones that I had heard.

        -S:  Really?  Nooooooooo....             
        
Q:  What do you think of NuKE now?
A:  I always had respect for NuKE - because they're everywhere..
    They know their shit.  Hey, they're all over.. 

        -E:  Yeah.. Check your master boot record.. 

Q:  Why when you were posting to me on Nucleus did you not know who NuKE was?
A:  Oh... I knew who it was - your news post really pissed me off though..

        -S:  The Capture Encryption Algorithm Strikes Again!

A:  I don't know..

        -S:  Yeah.. I swear these aren't trick questions..

Q:  What is the capacitance of a 3k resistor?
A:  uhh, does it really matter?

Q:  You did say your specialty was electronics right?
A:  yeah..

Q:  So...?
A:  so what?

Q:  Do you have any particular interests or other hobbies?
A:  Not really... I just like computers.

        -E:  How surprising...

Q:  Exactly what is the ShadowBox and how does it work?
A:  You call up and enter a code and it'll kick you over to the
    second line and if you enter the wrong code it'll ring the 
    number.

Q:  Have you ever seen the Magenta Box?
A:  no...

Q:  Why did you steal the Magenta Box, put your name on it, and call it

A:  I've got the money and tha equipment right now.

Q:  And how long do you think that system will stay up?
A:  Pretty much as long as I got the money..

Q:  I don't think you understand the question.. I mean, how long are you
    going to run without being put down?
A:  uhh it depends on the people there..  I trust my users..

Whoa!  Well, the schematic explains almost everything.  It would be
helpful to you if you used one color for the line #1 clips and another
for the line #2 clips.  It will work even if you get the ring and tip
mixed up, but you must get all of the clips on the right line.  But,
to be safe, you could put tags on each clip labeling it RING #1, TIP #2,
ect.

Installation.  Find one of those green posts that are about 3 feet high.
They are everywhere.  Get a socket wrench to open it up.  There will
be (a) row(s) of paired up posts.  Each pair of posts represents a line.
YOU *MUST* KNOW THE NUMBER OF LINE #1.  Sometimes the number is tagged
on to the pair of wires leading up to the posts, if so pick these posts
as your line #1.  Then you can pick any other set of posts for line #2.

Now to the good part.  Use of the the final product.  When you call up
line one from your house it will put line 2 on hold!! This is the 
greatest thing since sliced bread!

The Telco. will undoubtably discover the device after 2 days, so post
the number on your favorite boards so you can abuse it while it is in
service.  With a 2000 uF capacitor and a 1 meg resistor you will
get to hold a call for 50 minutes before it disconnects you.  By 
lowering the value of the resistor and capacitor you can change the 
time to your taste.  The formula for the time is the following:

2*R1    C1              C1 is in microfarads
---- * ----             R1 is in Kohms
100     10              See schematic for location of R1 and C1.
-----------  = Minutes
    60

The time produced by this formula is only approximate.

Well, that is one of the more complicated boxes to build.  But it
is very useful and will pay for itself with its first use.   It
would be wise to remove it before the Telco. finds it so you won't
have to make another, or install it on a line that belongs to a
family that is on vacation (GOOD IDEA) that way you can hold calls
for a REALLY really long time.

Well, there it is.  I hope it saves you a lot of cash.

If you wish to have one built for you.  Leave me E-mail to any EXiLED member.
It won't be more than $15 and hopefully it will only be about $8.
Trust us, it's worth it for this kind of boxing power!  Your very own 
hold button!!

			   LPT Port Disabling Routine

I wrote this routine just as a slight annoyance to place on someone's 
system whom I know.  It can be incorporated into any number of programs
such as viruses or trojans.  It effectively denies access to any LPT1
or LPT2 data either incoming or outgoing as it wipes the addressable
pointer clean.  Link with /L as this is a COM file.
