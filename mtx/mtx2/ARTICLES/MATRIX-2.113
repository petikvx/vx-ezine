PIF Format
Intel byte order
Information from File Format List 2.0 by Max Maischein.
--------------------------------------------
The Program Information Files have stayed a long time with the PC. They origi-
nated from IBMs Topview, were carried on by DoubleView and DesqView, and today
they are used by Windows and Windows NT. The PIF files store additional
information about executables that are foreign to the running multitasking
system such as ressource usage, keyboard and mouse virtualization and hotkeys.
The original (Topview) PIF had a size of 171h bytes, after that, there come the
various extensions for the different operating environments. The different
extensions are discussed in their own sections.
