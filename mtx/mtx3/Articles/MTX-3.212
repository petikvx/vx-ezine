   Metavirus - It is viruses which download update virus or virz plugin.

   In  this  article  we  shall speak  as  update you virus  via web page. In 
   windoze there  is a  library WININET.DLL in  which  there  is  a  heap  of 
   interesting functions of work with the Internet. You so are lower will see 
   two examples of updating of a virus through inet for Win32asm of viruses 
   and macroz viruses..

   Forgive me  but I  not so  love to  describe  of  different  functions and 
   everyone  shit  and consequently I  has inserted simply piece code from my 
   viruses. I think you will understand as it to use...

   - InternetOpen - the first Win32 Internet function called by viruz.
   - InternetOpenUrl - function  establishes connection with specified by you 
                        url.
   - InternetReadFile - function reads the file, specified by u virus...
   - InternetCloseHandle - function closes yours session and url connection
