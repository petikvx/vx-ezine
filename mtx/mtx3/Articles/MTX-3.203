In one of the Deviator's viruses i've found such a greet:

What about CDROM infector in ASM ?

and i start thinking why i should not write CDROM infector. This article only 
describes theory. But it is possible.

start:
~~~~~~

I do not know if it is possible to check for presence of CD ROM burner using 
GetDrivetypeA. Generally it could be easy checked how many CD ROM drives the 
computer has. If they are two there is about 80-90% chance we are on the 
machine with CD ROM burner.

And if we have CD ROM writer it is perfect. Lot of CD's have such a nice file 
called autorun.inf (the name itself calls to be infected) - from 20 CDROm I 
have found in my place 16 have had autorun.inf. Therefore we have to search 
recursively on all fixed drives for autorun.inf. If we have found this file 
user is likely about to burn a CD.


There is only sigle BUT. Some users have placed autorun.inf the root directory 
and thei are using this file to replace default disc icon in the system. In 
this particular case the file looks :

[Autorun]

ICON=Disc:\\path\\icon_name.ico

This one case can be easily checked using GetProfileString - we will check 
autorun.inf for presence of parameter OPEN=name_of_the_exe_file. If this 
parameter is not present at all there are only two options - there is no 
autorun.inf at all or it is that piece of shit with the icon described above.

If we have found autorun.inf and the file contains parameter 
OPEN=name_of_the_exe_file we can perform following operations: 

Infect the EXE file in the OPEN parameter 

Copy to the directory with the EXE file virus dropper and then add to the 
autorun.inf command to activate the dropper. For example:


OPEN=autorun.exe virus_dropper.exe 

autorun.exe - name of the autorun file 

virus_dropper.exe - name of our virus dropper 

What will happen if somebody puts this cdrom in the drive ? First of all the 
autorun.exe will be launched and then our virus dropper.


last word:
~~~~~~~~~~

I would like to express my thanks to viruswriter Deviator for pointing me to 
this idea.

Deviator - What about CD-ROM infector on asm ? :) 

ULTRAS - no problem... i coding it.. 

I will soon this thery on the computer with CD ROm burner and I will inform you 
about my results.
