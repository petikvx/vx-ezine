Interview with BumbleBee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

U> Tell me a little about yourself as a person, hobbies-music etc?

I'm spanish, but i haven't the tipical spanish *look* coz i'm blond hair,
tall and blue eyes. But the *feel* is spanish :)
I like read sci-fi (Asimov, Bradbury, Ballard) and also like *classical* 
rock/metal bands (from Deep Purple to Pantera).
I like to speak and is hard to me to shut up when i don't agree with
something. That's why sometimes i'm in trouble :/
But even i cannot stop speaking, is hard to me sometimes meet new ppl, until
i say 'hello' :)

Btw, my english sometimes sux. You've been adviced.

U> Where you get your handle?

uh When i started to code viruses i didn't used a handle. The nick came 
with IRC and *social vx scene*. When i was a boy a was mad about a comic 
called Transformers. Well, there was a little Volswagen Beetle called 
Bumblebee. I really liked it :)

U> Do your family/friends know about your virus activities?
   What do they think about it? Do you care of their opinion?

My family of coz know about my *activities*. Some friends knows about it
also. Really they respect my way, but from family part there is lil fear
about i don't do something not legal :) Of coz i care due i think the same. 
I dont' know any guy that thinks jail is fun. And we are here for the fun,
aren't we?

U> How did you start out in computers?

Long ago, when Spectrum Z-80 was the king on earth. That was a kewl machine,
with his 48Kbs. Fuck! I started to learn programming in gwbasic, that was
really hard coz we had only 64kbs for both the code and data, all inside an
interpreter. Later i get one of those powerfull computers where i was
learning: my 1st 0x86 with 512kbs of RAM and 7,6Mhz. C programming was very
hard to learn coz i needed to change diskette 4 times to compile a lame
'hello world!'. Coz i'm a poor guy and money hides away from me i was
several years fighting with my crappy 0x86 still i get a new Pentium 100 and
then i really started to code. From then my live is all arround computers,
books, music and... something to smoke please.

U> What was your first virus?

hehe Hard to remember. Let's go back to 1996. That was my first try after
reading many times MINOTAURO zines (DAN! DAN! DAN!). A little tsr com infector
for DOS. Nothing amazing, but it worked. I think i called it 'OSP' from 'Ojo
Sin Parpado'... from Lord of the Rings. I remember i used SFT and i
encrypted the char stringz used in the payload with a xor loop.

U> How did you start out in the virus scene?

I remember i found Darkman's web page and there was a: 'eu.undernet.org
#virus'. uh? What's this? Later i found virc97 and i connected. For some
time i thought that was paradise. Darkman, MrSandman, Griyo, ... all my
heroes there. After some joins i did query to Darkman and... the rest is
history (my history). And Bumblebee is here. I put a web page with all my
stuff till the date and AVP started to dectect them and put some
descriptions from time to time...

U> Which programming languages do you use?

Usualy JS for web pages; C, C++ and Java mainly for work; and of coz ASM for
virus coding. I've used C/C++ also in some worms. I've played also with
scripting kiddies.

U> Where do you live and how is the situation of the virus scene in your
   land?

As i said i'm spainsh, and i live in Spain, close to the sea. You know which
is the situation of virus scene in my country. We have coders, many good
coders. I'm kinda proud to contribute being another spanish coder. 'Spanin
is different' or something like :)

U> How many and which viriis did you write? Which do u like best? why?

About 30 i think. I don't know the exact number. If we quit viruses i coded
when i was learning and some experiments... may be i've coded only 2 or 3 
viruses :) Some names: Vanish, Anaphilaxys, Luna, AOC, Rainsong, Ayuda, 
Beefree, Plage2000, Bumbee, Desint, HKILL family, ...
It's hard to say which virus i like best. I think i did each one for one
reason and just in that moment was the best. May be i like them all, but i
don't think one is the best, just are different.

U> How do you name your viriis?

Music, books, experiences while coding it... Just a mirror of my real life.
After all the name of a virus is not the most important, but must fit in the
virus itself.

U> How do you spread your viriis?

I do not spread viruses at all. I release them at my web page. May be this
doesn't sounds very like a virus coder must do. But this is my way.
I'm not going to discuss here about spread or not spread. I'm sure each one
has his own opinion :)

U> Do you prefer a specific type of viriis? Which virus(es) do you like
   best?

I like viruses designed for a specific purpose. I mean i like small viruses
that are coded for being small. I also like very complex viruses. The most
important for me is the virus algorithm. Sometimes i do not include, even
remove some features coz them doesn't fit in the virus algorithm. A virus
with a clean algorithm is beautifull virus.

U> What E-zine you most of all like?

eh, i must reply this question? As ex-29Aer i must answer here (and i really
like to answer this) the best virus oriented e-magazine is...

U> Which AV product do you like best and why? Which do you piss off most?

I don't really like anyone. Most of them are shit and only care of the
money. But inside this bunch of garbage i think AVP (aka ?) smells less than
others. They have a nice scanner and sometimes the heuristical engine works.
Moreover they work really hard to release updates that sometimes only detect
the 1st generation sample and very often are not able to clean the infected
files.

I like a mixture of AVP and DrWeb32.

U> What VX technique are you most interested in?

I think EPO and metamorphism is just here. May be only genious as Zombie and
Vecna can make it run. But i feel other vxers will join the club soon. Some
guyz are doing really kewl EPO. Just work towards new meta age for viruses
of 21h century.
In absence of metamorphism i really like such poly engines like Tuareg, but
another time the vxer is very important (Mental Driller, i don't think
coding this beast is only matter of waste some free time).

U> What viruswriters you most of all respect?

Respect as virus writer i hope. hehehe. I really like a lot the work of
Vecna, Super, Mentar Driller, Giryo and of coz Zombie. But there are out 
there a lot of vxers with a great amount of quality. I can't put them all 
here...

U> What do you think about virii genenerators?

I cannot find the sense, even i've coded a little one some time ago. But i
can understand why to code a virus generator: it's fun :)

U> Are there things or people you dislike within the VX ?

Retarded ppl that likes to fuck the vx scene and claim to be part of the
community. You know who are them. I'm sure some name arrives to your mind.
This is mainly what i dislike of vx ppl, that instead of being all in the
same shit, some try to fuck others. This happens and will happen for ever
and ever. That's wild life.

U> What do you think about macro and script viruses?

Out of my scope. But this doesn't means you can do something nice in a
script lenguage. But simply i'm not interested, i like other things instead.
Scripting shit is the perfect source of hypo for av ppl. Moreover i cannot
have fun if it is easy.

U> What do you think about poly engines? Which do you like best?

Even i don't like to code'em, coz i'm lazy, there are some out there that
really worth to read. Griyo is a good poly coder, since HPS and Marburg. But
you know my preferences about Mental Driller's style. But again i must say
there are a lot of ppl with quality. I've seen stuff from b0z0, as example,
that is fucking poetry...

U> What do you think about destructive viruses?

It's silly. From my side the main aim of a virus is spread. Coding
destructive stuff you fuck also the virus, so i think it is aganist nature
of viruses. Even each one if free to code anything, i don't code destructive
stuff.

U> What are generally your goals in the virus writing context?

I like to have fun. Then i don't try to innovate or to make the virus that
will beat the media and will turn me into kinda underground hero that will
go tibet to learn seven years and get back with super powah... Nah. I like
to have fun and to not be bored.
I like to find the virus algorithm that fits the purpose i'm looking for.
Sometimes to test an idea, sometimes to make things different, sometimes to
evade all this shit of world.

U> When, why and how have you joined 29a?

I was accepted Sep 17 of 1999 :) I remember such date, but don't ask me my
phone number... I joined coz they accepted me. Why? I don't know, i suppose
coz they thought i had something to contribute to the group. I think
something i've contributed :) But the main reason to join 29A is to improve
yourself. And being with the best ppl you will be better!

U> Why you left from 29a

I'm not going to say why i left 29A coz that are personal reasons that i
don't like to expose here. But as you can see it is possible to leave 29A :)
Those things that are told about a satanic cult and blood and sacrifice and
so on... do not believe them hehehe ;)
Remebre a group is made of individuals.

U> What do you think about the current VX scene worldwide?

The so called vx scene is like a great animal that feeds from available
technology. It is ever changing and sometimes we will like it and sometimes
we won't. Since i'm here i've seen a lot of changes and i don't like most of
them, but i'm only a little part of the animal. Win32 viruses are being
improved and we will see how the evolution goes to more and more complex
viruses and tech. Sometimes i wonder how should be DOS virus if win wasn't
here. Since win appeared we made a new account and now the scene has enought
experience to make great things. Network is each day more important, but old
stuff is still available and full working. Who knows about the future? Now i
cannot like all the scene as community of ppl, but i like some viruses ppl
are coding.

U> Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (hacking, phreaking, warez
   etc.)?

Under underground i do nothing but virus coding. Moreover i'm a great
ignorant in other topics. Out of the underground world i've coded some
demos and games also :) I'm mainly a coder, that codes viruses, yep.

U> How would you consider the perfect virus?

From my point of view Zombie quite has coded it yet. May be metamorphism 
mixing 100% the virus with the host code, but it must use less resources
that actual code by Zombie requires. I think nobody did it before coz all
the ppl thought was not possible. I feel there are some guyz that have
the knowledge to do it. Now that ppl realizes can be done, ppl will try it.
I love Zombie :* hehehehe

U> Your plans in the future as coder and in general?

I don't know. If i tell you here i'm going to do something probably i'll lie
you coz i'm so unstable to really know what i'm going to do. I have some
unfinished projects and i ever have ideas i want to test. Moreover i have a
project going on with another vxer, but don't want to speak about... :)

U> Where can you be reached ?

I use to release my stuff at BumbleNET (pfff):

 http://bbbee.cjb.net

Notice this is a redirector that sometimes fails...

I usually waste my time at undernet IRC in #vxers channel.


U> Any greetz?

The worst part of greetings is ever you frogot someone. Don't hate me if
you're not in the list :) (or hate me if you know why you aren't here).

Here follows some greetz in random order: ppl that i like for one or other
reason...

Perikles, Ratter, Vecna, VirusBuster, Super, Nigr0, Billy Belcebu, Ultras,
Jackie Twoflower, Mental Driller, YbY, Wintermute, Tcp, Benny, Prizzy,
Lord Julus, Star0, Raajat, Spanska, Scipio, Mantha, Toro, Kamaileon, 
Zombie, MrSandman, Cicatrix, Clau, Pharmie, Krizya, X hehehe

U> Any final word?

I would like to thanx Ultras for this interview since i don't think i'm so
interesting to waste kbs of disk. But as he is so kind to request... :)

Now you think you know more about the bee... probably my doctor doesn't
agree with you :p

The way of the bee
