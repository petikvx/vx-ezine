Interview with HenKy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

U> Tell me a little about yourself as a person, hobbies-music etc?
H> Well, im a psicho-paranoic guy that pass all his free time between 
   computers, arcade machines and some sex-shops xDDDD

   I love read, classics like "Odissee" , "Lord of Rings"... etc, newer 
  sci-fi books...(Im Terry Pratchet fan), and i love satanist books like
  "Crucifax" by Ray Garton...   

  My music style is hard to say, is something between hard-core and 
  techno-trance, anyway im a progressive lover (im used to listen it
  when coding) 

U> Where you get your handle?

H> Ive used several handles, but in VX-scene only HenKy, ive took it from
   one manga movie called "Fly" (a very sux one xDDD ) 

U> Do your family/friends know about your virus activities?

H> Mi parents no, they think that im one gamer-maniac or something. But 
   my friends know my "activities" hehe, something they try to gave me 
   some deas for my viruses. 

U> What do they think about it? Do you care of their opinion?

H> NO absolutely, im free, anyway i do not harm people with viruses, 
   im only send them to avers and collectors.

U> How did you start out in computers?

H> Later, three years ago, when i had my first computer (one p166 mmx), 
   i learned some pascal at school and i become interested fastly in asm.

U> What was your first virus?

H> Heheh, some pseudo-finished-lame full stealth boot sector virus, 
   using stoned and michelangelo as base, the stealth routined worked quite 
   nice, but the infection routine was hell-buggy... is lost on some sector 
   on my hd's.

U> How did you start out in the virus scene?

H> I was VERY stoned when one virus called "Bleah.b" infected one high 
   school pc, and modified CMOS being not able to boot from floppy (oh, 
   incredible xDDD ) i meet another viruses like "Barrotes" in school too, 
   and i say : "I WANNA DO IT!!!"

   I saw in one Spanish Magazine the description of virus "Illusion" by 
   ThE WiZarD, i went to his homepage, i downloaded tasm and all utils 
   needed to code. It was the begin.

U> Which programming languages do you use?

H> Mainly asm, but for big applications i use pascal, dos,w32 and Linux 
   both (im pascal maniac). Im learning some Java, and im still triying to 
   learn C  .

U> Where do you live and how is the situation of the virus scene in your land?

H> Hehe, i live in SPAIN, the country of Sun, Sex and viruses xDDDD. I think 
   is the country with more virus coders after Czech Republic. Many great 
   groups like DDT an 29A... u know ;)

U> How many and which viriis did you write? Which do u like best? why?

H> well, now i dunno the number, maybe ~30, but some of them were experimentally 
   only. I dont have one "best" virus because i become fastly bored if icant 
   finish it in three o five days.

   here is some list (for sure i forget some)

 * w32 orochi
 * w95 solidario
 * w95 red-warrior
 * w32 sadorom
 * w95 crucifax
 * w95 megamix
 * w32 kaido
 * w95 palletok
 * w95 Henze 
 * w95 putita
 * w95 estukista
 * w95 estuprista
 * html lollypop
 * wnt  Adonai
 * w32 Tanzen
 * w32 Mordred
 * w32 Morgue
 * w95 espinete
 * w95 pincho
 * w32 sanazul
 * w32 goenitz
 * w32 listillo
   w95 listillo
 * w32 zipher
 * w32 skiz0fren
 * w95 makina
 * w32 rotten
 .....

  sadly avers detects all as "W32 Henky" even when they are VERY differents... 
  avers sucks.


U> How do you name your viriis?

H> Hehe, the first name that appears in my mind...


U> How do you spread your viriis?

H> I do not spread them.

U> Do you prefer a specific type of viriis? Which virus(es) do you like best?

H> I like viruses like CIH: compact, fast, small and mega spreading, and with 
   nice payload ;)
   Macro viruses are not bad (see Melissa or Loveletter)
   but they have nothing to do against asm ones.

U> What E-zine you most of all like?

   MATRiX, 29a and XiNE are the best nowadays.


U> Which AV product do you like best and why? Which do you piss off most?

H> All av sucks, but Pccillin (Trend Micro) is the more pathetic one: ive took 
   one evaluation version (it needs one code for activate) and i was able to 
   crack it without have to modify registry or the executable or something, the 
   trick: launch main executable, it ask for activation code,do not close the 
   window and open it again ... oh surprise, the av runs and it have all options 
   enabled, even the hell-lame virus descriptions. pffffff....
   I hope this bug were fixed in future versions.... 
   (it worked me on the w9x version)

U> What VX technique are you most interested in?

H> At the beggining Metamorphism, now i think that the best thing will be make 
   virus hard to remove and system dependant that hard to detect.

U> What viruswriters you most of all respect?

H> Well, i dont want to put here one big list, i respect all original and good 
   ones.

U> What do you think about virii genenerators?

H> Hehe, im coding one, i love them ... they are the living hell by avers, they 
   have to test all possible variants.... 

U> Are there things or people you dislike within the VX ?

H> Well, nobody is perfect, i dont like people that wastes his time on #vxers 
   instead coding and then have a prepotent attitude, thinking that they have 
   some "power" over rest of people.

U> What do you think about macro and script viruses?

H> ive asked some few lines ago :)

U> What do you think about poly engines? Which do you like best?

H> bah, avers will detect they sooner or later, i dont care about they.
   The best that i saw was the Prizzy's one on "w32Crypto"

U> What do you think about destructive viruses?

H> well, is coool !!!  xDDD no, is joke, destructive payloads must be when 
   debugging or tracing, and do no harm normal users.


U> What are generally your goals in the virus writing context?

H> Goals?, now none, i dont have time, and im thinking to leave viruswriting, 
   my purpose is finish all my old stuff and then.. who knows.

U> What do you think about the current VX scene worldwide?

H> hey ULTRAS, what a question!!! xDDDDD

U> Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (hacking, phreaking, warez
   etc.)?

H> Ive done a lot of "illegal stuff" , some hacking, arcade rom dumping, 
   application cracking... and some things that i cant tell here ;)
   Anyway, i do not harm people with my activities,and i dont take profit 
   with them, is only for fun.

U> How would you consider the perfect virus?

H> Bfff, the perfect virus can exist only for some limited time, for example, 
   CIH,Loveletter... were highspreaded (the main purpose of the virus is 
   spreading).

   Another thing is talk about perfect "technically talking" viruses... maybe 
   some multiplatform / os / target virus, hard to remove and detect, and of 
   course, must be quite stable. (hard thing).

U> Your plans in the future as coder and in general?

H> As coder, i want to write some application that make me rich xDDDD.
   But im also interested in emulation and compression in general.

U> Where can you be reached ?

   henky_@latinmail.com  (do no spam plz xD )

U> Any greetz?

H> hellos to:
   ThE WiZarD, Virtual Daemon, Jose Ruibal, SandStorm, Aklis, Argeon Arkan, 
   Jonh0Ann, Kike and Mike Platinas xDDDD

U> Any final word?
H> "... wake up NEO... the MATRiX has you..."
