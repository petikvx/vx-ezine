Interview with Lord Julus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

U> Tell me a little about yourself as a person, hobbies-music etc?

Well, I am ok as a person... Really... sometimes I look in the mirror and 
say to myself: man, do you look cool!! ;-) Hehehehe... Well, really, you 
might say that I am a nice person to be friend to. I love music... I could 
stay for hours just listening to music. Listening, I repeat, not doing 
anything else in the same time. I am a great fan of Manowar, Dio, Iron 
Maiden, Rainbow, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, and other bands that most people 
probably don't even remember... ;-) I am also learning to play guitar and I 
love to go out and travel mostly at the mountains...

U> Where you get your handle?

        It  was back in 1994 when I got connected for the first time onto 
the
net.  In  those times we were using some shity text mode browser called Lynx
or something and only allowed me to browse some sites including some sort of
chat  rooms.  In one of the days I was trying to download my favorite Sandra
Bullock  pictures, I stumbled over one of these chat rooms where all members
there  were  called  "count",  "marquis",  "duke", and so on... So I quickly
typed "Lord Julus" and so it stayed. I never used any other nick name.

U> Do your family/friends know about your virus activities?
   What do they think about it? Do you care of their opinion?

        Yes,  they  know.  My  family doesn't say anything except some 
seldom
reminders that I am doing something which is not really all right and all my
friends  seem  to  think  I  am  some  sort of super-hacker or something. In
reality I never did more than write virus es in the H/V/C/P fields.

U> How did you start out in computers?

        I  started in 1988 when I first met with a Sinclair Spectrum 
computer
and the art of doing eclipses in 20 lines of basic or moving a turtle in the
LOGO  language amazed me... I imediately started to write programs even if I
didn't  own a computer, but I sim ply imagined what they would do... Later I
bought  a  computer similar to Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Later I bought my first
PC  in  1991.  It  was  an XT with 640K of RAM and 20M of HDD and a Hercules
Graphix  card...  I will never forget the "Barbarian" game I playe d on that
computer...  Later  I  had  a  286,  and  so  on, until today... As far as I
remember I always tried to stay up to the latest technology.

U> What was your first virus?

        My  very  first  virus was a simple DOS virus I called "Whiplash". 
It
never got anywhere, but, heck... it was my first try...

U> How did you start out in the virus scene?

        I  do owe my entrance in the vx scene to the 29A group and 
especially
to MrSandman who first read my article on polymorphism and agreed to publish
it  in  the 29A issue #2. It was a big honor for me and that's when I really
decided that I like the virus scene...

U> Which programming languages do you use?

        I  mostly program in ASM, but I love Borland Pascal. I rarely 
program
under  C,  Visual  C.  At  the  office I have to use a lot of VB (iiiih) and
FoxPro... At a certain moment I wanted to write a FoxPro virus... but then I
woke up ;-)

U> Where do you live and how is the situation of the virus scene in your
   land?

        Well, I live in Romania, but this situation is going to change 
pretty
soon.  In Romania the virus scene does not exist. There exist virus authors,
some  of  them even wrote famous viruses like Alex, Dodgy. Let me not forget
my  friend  VirtualDaemon who proud ly conducted the SLAM group for a couple
of  years.  But  there is no such thing as chats or meetings. There are some
know av's also here, probably you heard about RAV and AVX. I have to say 
also that in about 9 months I will be moving to the USA, hopefuly forever...

U> How many and which viriis did you write? Which do u like best? why?

Let me recall:

        1.  Win95.Julus  -  my  very  first windows virus. Was supposed to 
be
win32 but it's not. Stupid and full of bugs
        2.  Win32.Undertaker  -  my first real windows virus. This one 
worked
pretty well. Had a few bugs, but I liked it.
        3. Win32.DROL - one of the very first viruses that inserted a 
section
before the last two sections. It was a pretty nifty piece of code this one
        4.  Win95.Manowar  -  this  was  my  first  Ring0 virus, pretty 
good,
completely NOT original
        5.  Win95.SignOfTheHammer  -  the  second  Ring0  virus that 
featured
complete memory encryption
        6.  Win95.Cargo  -  very neat idea, using the toolhelp. 
Unfortunately
had bugs and it's considered intended.
        7.  Win32.Hatred  -  This one was a very nice win32 virus, one of 
the
first  that  completely  parsed  all the directories on all available hdd's.
There  exists a so called Hatred.b, which is really a ripped version done by
Lucky.
        8. Win32.Thunderpick - not very exceptional, but pretty cool
        9.  Win32.Rammstein  -  This  is  the best virus I have ever 
written.
Almost  removed  all  incompatibilities with the PE structure and has almost
100% Win32 compatibility. I really love this baby... It's the first virus, I
think, that really creates windows and processes their messages.

Ongoing projects: Win32.Discreditor, Win32.AI, Win32.Iris.

U> How do you name your viriis?

        Mostly  from  music, but I cannot say that I have a specific thing 
in
my mind... Whatever comes more handy... I think that leaving an open door to
the mind and let it flow is much more interesting than torturing yourself to
find  something  that you can late r call "interesting". I think spontaneity
is best!

U> How do you spread your viriis?

        I do not really spread them because I have no time for that. I 
simply
send  them to virus traders like Sledge, Tally, etc and I publish the source
and the binary on the web. For the rest, let God take care of it...

U> Do you prefer a specific type of viriis? Which virus(es) do you like
   best?

        Of  course!  I  always  did  and  always  will prefer executable 
file
infection.  So  basically nowadays you may say that I like PE infection. So,
saying  this,  it  means  I  do  not like other things like macro virii, vbs
scripts, html or java, or whatever. My favorite viruses are Prizzy's 
creations and Z0mbie's stuff.

U> What E-zine you most of all like?

        Of  course  I  like  29A and I will always will, but among the rest 
I
have  to  say that from the old crews I love IR and VLAD and from the latest
years  XZine,  RSA,  Matrix.  But  the  biggest impact on me ever had the IR
zines.

U> Which AV product do you like best and why? Which do you piss off most?

        AVP is one of my favorites. That's because they always had good 
virus
analisys,  very  good  emulators and heuristic scanners. I am very pissed of
Norton's  Antivirus  products because they try to set it as an international
av product (they try to stick like a leach to the Microsoft OS), while their
detection  ability  is far lower than most of the products on the market. In
other words: they suck! ;-)

U> What VX technique are you most interested in?

        Polymorphism  is  the  technique that always fascinated me. I 
studied
many  poly  engines  written in the past years and have written some myself,
but  this  is  a  field  that always allows more and more to be developed. I
think that there's nothing that makes a v irus stronger than the poly engine
included   inside.   Combine   it  with  strong  arithmetic  encryption  and
compression  and  you  have  the  perfect  one.  Next  on  my  agenda  comes
metamorphism  and this is a fields which I am in the process of studying and
testing. If you cannot imagine what you can do with poly, you don't have the
slightest idea what you can do with meta...

U> What viruswriters you most of all respect?

        I  will  always  respect  Z0mbie  and Vecna for their work. I say 
for
their  work  because I didn't get a chance to know them well enough. Both of
them  have  fascinating  pieces  of code and it will be no wonder to me if I
will  find  them  over years working for NAS A with those ideas of theirs. I
also have great respect for Jacky Qwerty whom I knew better and proved to be
a  hell  of  a guy. And I respect Sandman for peeing into the toiled and not
around when he was drunk ;-)))

U> What do you think about virii genenerators?

        Let  me get this straight once and for all. Virus generators are 
very
good  for  beginners, because they can generate all kinds of viruses and see
how depending on the options the source code is changeing and they can learn
from  that.  But  of  course,  the  le  arning capacity generated by a virus
generator is limited to the knowledge of the generator programmer. And also,
let's not forget that unicity and .... are two qulities that should exist in
a virus. Generators make quantity but the same quality.

U> Are there things or people you dislike within the VX ?

        I  don't  like  big egos. Even if you are the best coder or just 
some
newbie  just  stay  in  your  own  space and do not breathe the other's air.
There's enough air for everybody and the scene does not need inside fights.

U> What do you think about macro and script viruses?

        ;-) I already told that. Not interesting but effective in the wild. 
I
played  a  little  bit  with  Excel  VB  programming  and  I  made  quite an
interesting  excel  macro virus. Let us not forget that office tools are the
most  used  tools  in the bussiness world and not only and that email is the
way  of  communication in these days. So, that's why they are effective. But
the  way to create them... It just doesn't give me that ice on the back like
creating cracks inside the complicated PE structure...

U> What do you think about poly engines? Which do you like best?

        Oh, I love them, as I said... I can't rememeber which one I like 
best
but  from the latest I remember I simply loved the polys in Prizzy's viruses
as  well as Mentals. Mine are not so complicated, but I am working on a huge
poly engine called Modularis whi ch will probably be released in 29A#6 and I
hope it's gonna meet the tops.

U> What do you think about destructive viruses?

        No,  no,  no.  I've been there (got my systems down once by DIRII 
and
once  by  OneHalf  -  remember? ;-)) I think there is nothing interesting in
destroying  a  computer.  That  of  course  if by destructive virus you only
understand  a virus that wipes information. But think of a virus that steals
important documents, or access passwords? Is that destructive? Might be...

U> What are generally your goals in the virus writing context?

        Learning.  It's  always  been  learning.  As I said many times, 
virus
writing  allows one person to develop programming skills in many fields. The
domain  is  so  vast  that  you  can basically get a grip on a little bit of
everything. My goal is far from "1|/|f3kt the W0rlD"... I just want to learn
and  share  knowledge to other interested people... and anoy avers from time
to time ;-))

U> What happened with SLAM team?

        We  just  disbanded.  I  joined  SLAM  when  most of the members 
were
entering  a  new  phase  in their life like college and others so nobody had
time to code. I was in my best year then so that is why I decided to release
my  own  work  in  the VXtasy ezine. I have t o say all the guys in the SLAM
team  were absolutely great and very good friends, especially VirtualDaemon.
It was a very nice group and I hope all went well for all the members.

U> When, why and how have you joined 29a?

        As  I  said  29a  was the group that first published my stuff, me 
and
Sandman became very good friends so I always felt something special for this
group.  Since  I  also  liked  darkman  a  lot a while after he joined 29a I
decided  to  go  along  with them so that was it. Since then quite a few new
members appeared and quite a few disappeared but things are going ok for the
moment. We are looking forward for a new ezine a lot of quality code!

	Heh... I wrote the above sentance 3 days ago, and today I quit 29A. I am 
not going to tell my reasons, they are personal, but I have to say that it 
has nothing to do with any of the 29A guys who are absolutely great. I the 
mean time I am trying (not really with too much success) to form my own 
group, and (maybe?!?!) release a second Vxtasy? God knows...

U> What do you think about the current VX scene worldwide?

        It would be a clishee to say it is "fucked up", but unfortunately, 
as
always  the  worldwide scene IS fucked up. Servers are being shutdown, pages
are  erased,  members  are roaming between groups, people fight over IRC and
ban  eachother,  more  and  more copyca t code appears. No, there is no real
unity  in  the scene and the avers are watching this, I assume, quite happy.
There  are  three big sides to the vx scene: people who do not code too much
or  very good but they want to show-off, people who code wonderful b ut stay
hidden  and  people who are between those somewhere in the middle. It's like
the  underground  vx world is like a subway that comes upground from time to
time. But, anyway, overall speaking and looking at the amount of new viruses
that  emerge  each  mo  nth, I would say that the vx world is far from going
down. There are still many rounds to play!

U> Do you do other computer stuff outside VX (hacking, phreaking, warez
   etc.)?

        No,  I  just play games... I am a strategy games freak ;-) My 
forever
favorite  game  is  Civilization,  then  comes  Tycoon  series, Sims. As for
adventure I simply adore all Lucas games and some of Sierra's.

U> How would you consider the perfect virus?

        The perfect virus in the year of 2001? Well:

  It should:
  - be able to infect PE files on all Win32 platforms
  - insert itself in the original code section
  - be compressed with a good algorithm (LZ, LZSS, LZW or Huffman)
  - have a strong encryption algorithm
  - have a strong poly engine (should generate a decryptor as big as
    the virus itself)
  - use FPU and MMX instructions
  - decrypt itself at startup in more than 3 seconds (die to emulators ;-))
  - allocate memory and run from there
  - use SEH
  - recalculate the checksum
  - use per-process residency
  - use CRC32 to find apis
  - erase av checksum files
  - avoid certain files including av
  - infect all files that are PE (not only exe and scr)
  - restore all regs and stack as at entry before returning to host
  - be able to look/browse main email client's address boxes (outlook,
    netscape, eudora, etc)
  - be able to attach itself to email messages
  - be able to modify IRC scripts and send itself over IRC sessions
  - be ablt to infect the Local Network

  It should NOT:
  - contain any unencrypted ascii strings
  - have ONE single byte as a scan string
  - launch more than one thread
  - modify sections characteristics
  - move the entrypoint from the code section
  - modify values in the header except checksum
  - try to kill av windows
  - use ring0 or any undocumented apis or interrupts

        In  my  opinion  the above combination gives the perfect virus in 
the
following  idea:  a  virus who is highly infectious, hard to detect and runs
safely.

U> Your plans in the future as coder and in general?

        I  still  have  a  great deal of ideas and probably you will see 
some
more  stuff  from  me. In general I will be moving to the USA and completely
change my life so I cannot really say what is going to happen to me. I might
have  so much work to do there that I might not have any time for coding, or
maybe not... Who knows?

U> Where can you be reached ?

        My  usual  email  address  is  lordjulus@geocities.com.  If  this 
one
doesn't work you may try any of my webmail addresses: lordjulus@hotmail.com,
lordjulus@home.ro,   lordjulus@rol.ro.  I  love  receiving  mails  so  don't
hesitate to write me. My web page is at http: //lordjulus.cjb.net. This is a
forwarder  so  if  you  will  receive  an  error it means I am searching for
another free server. As I write this now my page is working. Also, do not 
forget that I host a virus list which is already almost 3 years old and has 
around 350 subscribers. You can subscribe to this list by sending an email 
to virus-list-subscribe@yahoogroups.com, or mail me if you have problems.

U> Any greetz?

        Sure:  to  the  entire  Matrix  crew,  to MrSandman, Darkman, all 
the
present, past and future members of 29A, iKX members, TheUnforgiven, and all
the guys that I ever spoke with on email or irc.

U> Any final word?

        I  hope  I will be able to write something again in the Matrix#20 
;-)
Thank  you  for taking this interview and it is a big honor for me to appear
in your fine ezine. All the best and all the rest! Stay well,

                                                   Lord Julus / 29A
