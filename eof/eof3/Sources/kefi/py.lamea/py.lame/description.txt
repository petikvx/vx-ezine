some information on the virus:
- second version of 'py.lame.a' (my poc python virus from years ago)
- each mutation changes its xor encryption key
- each mutation randomly generates its decryptor
- prepends its code into *.py files in the current directory

attachments:
'pylameb.txt' - first generation; no encryption
'pylameb-gen2' - second generation; xor encrypted
'pylameb-gen3' - third generation; xor encrypted


enjoy :)
