This is very simple infector for the FreeBSD. It infects all files in
current directory.  The virus appends new  segment to the end of file
by replacing PT_PHDR entry.

The  code of virus consists of two parts:  the head and the tail. The
head (in assembler) will  determine the  addresses and  sizes of both
parts and define a wrapper for the system calls.  The head invoke the
tail (passing  all  necessary parameters)  and return  control to the
host program. All other functions:  search, read, modification, write
etc  embodied in tail (in C), using the  system call function located
in head.
