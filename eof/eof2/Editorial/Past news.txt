Right after our first zine release, SkyOut (past leader) has decided to leave EOF  and
close the project, because of that we was inactive for two months. In February of 2007
we have gathered all together again and had revived the project. By that  time  AzRaEL
has joined EOF, who had really helped us a lot. He did for us  really  much, for  what
we want to thank him very much!

In the same month, WarGame has left EOF and joined DooMRiderz group.
