About the viewer
izee / EOF


The viewer is designed by RadiatioN, who we want to thank a lot for the
great work. The viewer should  work  fine  on  Opera, Firefox, IE 7, it
wasn't tested on other browsers. IE 6 don't support  alpha-blending  of
PNG images, so the viewer may look  ugly  on  that  browser. The  music
should play also, if you have Flash installed on your system.
