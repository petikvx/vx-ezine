DESCRIPTION:
This article is about compression and will be short as possible because I don't want to bother you.
Just want, advert you on some un-documented functions of Windows NT/XP and Windows Server 2003 that
are used by OS it-self for internal operations during compression and some MS utility programs for
managing files with attribute "compressed". Functions were discovered in 2000. and I'm badly surprised
that this is very first usage by virus writers. Functions are exported by ntdll.dll dynamic-linking
library and exist on x86 and x64 editions of mentioned OSes, that is Microsoft implementation of Lempel-Ziv
algorithm. I don't know about Windows Vista but I'm pretty sure Vista has those functions built-in.

FUNCTIONS:



NTSTATUS RtlCompressBuffer ( USHORT CompressionFormatAndEngine, PUCHAR UncompressedBuffer, ULONG UncompressedBufferSize,
PUCHAR CompressedBuffer, ULONG CompressedBufferSize, ULONG UncompressedChunkSize, PULONG FinalCompressedSize, PVOID WorkSpace )

Parameters:

	[in] CompressionFormatAndEngine
	Format of compression and level of compression, for correct values look at inside
	of WinNT.h under macro names COMPRESSION_FORMAT* and COMPRESSION_ENGINE*
	(eg. COMPRESSION_FORMAT_LZNT1 | COMPRESSION_ENGINE_STANDARD)

	[in] UncompressedBuffer
	The starting address of source buffer to be compressed

	[in] UncompressedBufferSize
	Size in bytes of source buffer

	[out] CompressedBuffer
	The starting address of destination buffer, where compressed data
	will be stored after compression 

	[in] CompressedBufferSize
	Size of destination buffer 

	[in] UncompressedChunkSize
	Put 0x1000. Probably means page size 

	[out] FinalCompressedSize
	Size in bytes of data after compression 

	[in] WorkSpace
	The starting address of internal buffer used during compression,
	beforehand established by RtlGetCompressionWorkSpaceSize

Return values:

	Use NT_SUCCESS macro to determinate, failed or success



NTSTATUS RtlGetCompressionWorkSpaceSize ( USHORT CompressionFormatAndEngine,  PULONG CompressBufferWorkSpaceSize,
PULONG CompressFragmentWorkSpaceSize )

Parameters:

	[in] CompressionFormatAndEngine
	Look at RtlCompressBuffer description for more information

	[out] CompressBufferWorkSpaceSize
	You must allocate temporary internal buffer, buffer is used by RtlCompressBuffer.
	Buffer must have CompressBufferWorkSpaceSize bytes length.

	[out] CompressFragmentWorkSpaceSize
	Unknown.

Return values:

	Use NT_SUCCESS macro to determinate, failed or success



NTSTATUS RtlDecompressBuffer ( USHORT CompressionFormat, PUCHAR UncompressedBuffer, ULONG UncompressedBufferSize,
PUCHAR CompressedBuffer, ULONG CompressedBufferSize, PULONG FinalUncompressedSize )

Parameters:

	[in] CompressionFormat
	Look at RtlCompressBuffer description for more information, but looks like
	it is discarded.

	[out] UncompressedBuffer
	The starting address of destination buffer, where data will be stored after
	decompression

	[in] UncompressedBufferSize
	Size in bytes of destination buffer

	[in] CompressedBuffer
	The starting address of compressed buffer, data to be uncompressed

	[in] CompressedBufferSize
	Size of compressed buffer in bytes

	[out] FinalUncompressedSize
	Size of data in bytes after decompression

Return values:

	Use NT_SUCCESS macro to determinate, failed or success



Ending:
I'm sorry for example code not included (because lack of time) in this short article.
I hope you'll find those functions useful, especially when implementing of your own
compression / decompression engine isn't suitable, btw 'this' compression algorithm looks
like is also used by NTFS for managing files with attribute 'compressed' . Thank you for your time.
