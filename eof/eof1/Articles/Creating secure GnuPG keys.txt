How to create a RSA/ElGamal-Key or an RSA/RSA-Key with GnuPG?
-------------------------------------------------------------

To make this HowTo short I won't spend much time explaining the basics which
should be known. It demotivates to read the Manpage if you wanna create other
keypairs then those provided by the limited generator.
If you create a normal Keypair you`ll mostly get an DSA/ElGamal-Keypair
if you don`t choose RSA. A normal DSA/ElGamal-Keypair is 1024Bit/4096Bit strong.
The ElGamal value is variable but the DSA value is limited by the specification
to exactly 1024Bit.

DSA (1024Bit FIPS-180-1) is used to sign your messages and ElGamal is used
to encrypt the messages. The problem with DSA is the limitation to 1024Bit
and propably also that it was invented by the NSA.

I prefer ElGamal because the mathematical concepts behind
RSA and Elgamal are different. If you choose RSA all your trust belongs
to the mathematical princip this algorithm belongs to.
This means if the mathematical problem of RSA was solved some day
your signatures can be faked.
I personaly recomment ElGamal-RSA combination.

So how do you create other Kay-Pairs then those provided by the Keygeneration?
Both Methods provide a 4096/4096 Bit Keypair (compared to 1024/4096 
wich is the default).

I won't make this HowTo big so just type the following commands at your shell.

shell-type -> gpg --gen-key
choose -> 5
choose -> your options (4096Bit should be used)

shell-type -> gpg --key-edit &KEY-ID
shell-type -> addkey
shell-type -> ElGamal (4) or RSA (6)

choose-> your options (4096Bit are prefered again.. right?)
type -> Quit the interactive-mode with "quit"

To check the results use gpg --list-keys &KEYID

-------------------------------
As you can see we generated a 4096/4096 Bit Keypair (I choosed RSA/ElGamal).

Have Fun...
