How to establish connections through router with Network Address Translation (NAT)?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As a result of security and alot hacking attacks, most homeuser use routers with internal hardware firewalls
to protect themself of danger from the internet. To translate the WAN ip to LAN ip(s) there exists a 
technique called Network Address Translation (short: NAT). In this technique the router holds a table
of entries with source and destination ip + ports to route incoming packets to the right pc in the LAN who
reuqested data in the Internet. Most (or better: alot of) people think this is a umbreakable wall which 
cannot be destroyed.

Do you ever used Skype or Hamachi? If yes, do you ever wondered yourself why this apps are able to establish 
direct connections to each other without activated port translastion in the router through the NAT?
In this tutorial i will describe how you can break NAT and establish UDP data transfer through two routers 
with active NAT. I'll use the the tricks i found out from Skype :)

In this tutorial i can only descibe how UDP data transfer works through NAT, cause i never found out how
to get a solution for TCP. Skype only uses TCP when there occur to many errors, but i was never able to create 
so much errors :D

In my example i want to use Alice and Bob as the name of PC1 and PC2. 
(i hope you can interpret my ASCII graphics)

The scene:
                     +------------+
                     | Connection |
                     |   Server   |
                     +------------+
                            |
                            |
  +-------+            _____|____            +-------+
  |       |   ____    |          |   ____    |       |
  | Alice |---|___|---| Internet |---|___|---|  Bob  |
  |       |   Router  |__________|   Router  |       |
  +-------+                                  +-------+

To get the trick working both clients need to be connected to the connection server via TCP, which could be a 
modified irc server or somethings else which is able to answer requests instantly. So Alice and Bob are
now connected to this server, waiting for request for each other. The connection server has now registered
ans stored the ip of Alice and Bob to send it back to the other remote host for a 'connectback'.
(You will see what i mean).

Now wants Alice to call Bob and sends a request to the connection server to notify Bob to answer Alice's
request after some milliseconds.

                     +------------+
               ___\  | Connection | _____
 Request for  /   /  |   Server   |      \   TCP notification from server to answer
 connection  /       +------------+       \  after some milliseconds to Alice
 (TCP)      /               |              \|
           /                |              ¯
  +-------+            _____|____            +-------+
  |       |   ____    |          |   ____    |       |
  | Alice |---|___|---| Internet |---|___|---|  Bob  |
  |       |   Router  |__________|   Router  |       |
  +-------+                                  +-------+

Alice sends now a UDP packet to Bob with destination port set to 500 and source port 
set to 300 for example. So the local NAT translation of Alice adds an entry to its table for Bob's Ip and the
incoming port (300) to forward data to Alice if an answer packet will arrive from Bob.

                     +------------+
                     | Connection |
                     |   Server   |
                     +------------+
              New           |
              NAT           |
  +-------+   entry    _____|____            +-------+
  |       |   ____    |          |   ____    |       |
  | Alice |---|___|---| Internet |---|___|---|  Bob  |
  |       |   Router  |__________|   Router  |       |
  +-------+                                  +-------+
       \                             /\
        \                            || Router blocks packet
         \___________________________/  
                  UDP Packet

Now Bob's NAT blocks the incoming UDP packet, cause no entry in the table exists for this destination port.
Some short time later Bob sends also an UDP packet as requested from Alice over the connection server to 
Alice's Ip (Destination port: 300, Source port: 500). But now there exists an entry in Alice's Router NAT 
table to forward data to Alice's local PC in the LAN. The packet of Bob was able to reach Alice through the 
NAT cause we built a whole in the Firewall.

                     +------------+
                     | Connection |
                     |   Server   |
                     +------------+
                            |        New
                            |        NAT
  +-------+            _____|____    entry   +-------+
  |       |   ____    |          |   ____    |       |
  | Alice |---|___|---| Internet |---|___|---|  Bob  |
  |       |   Router  |__________|   Router  |       |
  +-------+                                  +-------+
      /\                                        /
      ||                                       /
       \______________________________________/
                      UDP Packet

Bob's router does the same as Alice's router and adds also an entry to its NAT table to forward packets 
from Alice into the LAN. Now are both able to transfer data through this two wholes in the Firewall.

                     +------------+
                     | Connection |
                     |   Server   |
                     +------------+
                            |
                            |

                 UDP Packet data transfer

As you can see its not to complicated to establish connections through two NAT routers. This is only possible
why NAT router manufacturer and programmer think that outgoing packets also will get an answer from the other 
host and add a entry to their NAT table :) Maybe, but i dont know, is someone able to get connections working 
without using some extra connection server as shown in the example. If you will find it out, you can notify 
me about success or failure :)

I hope you understood all of my tutorial cause my english sucks as you may already noticed :)
