            The single biggest threat to man's continued dominance
                         of the planet is the virus.

    Welcome to the third edition of the Codebreakers Magazine.
Hopefully, you have had the pleasure of reading the first two editions
of the mag and already know who we are.  If not, we are the Codebreakers,
a small group of virus writers and hackers who are committed to
stimulating the virus community and educating beginners to this marvelous
domain.
    The majority of our articles are progressive in nature. In other
words, to gain the most from our tutorials, you should follow the
curriculum that we have established.  This is actually very simple, just
start with the first mag and work your way on up.  During the process,
you will gain a broad, yet detailed, education in practically every field of
virus writing.
    I will probably keep saying this with each upcoming edition of
the mag, "This is the most kick-ass edition yet!"  Well, it is.  We have
included many tutorials such as Memory Residency Techniques, Encryption,
Virus Add-Ons, Anti-AV Techniques, a Basic Assembly Review, Hacking, and
much more!  Take a look at the commentaries and other articles that our
members have written, they will help you grasp who we are and why we do
what we do.
    The Anti-Virus community continues to classify virus writers as
some kind of unique underground community...
