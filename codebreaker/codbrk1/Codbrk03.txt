These are a few questions that I put together which are not to be looked on as a test, rather a 
review guide.  When learning assembly, you really need to be reviewing concepts constantly or 
you will forget them.  Don't sweat the questions, they are really easy.  The answers should all be 
in Lesson #1.  In the next edition of the magazine, I will discuss the answers to the questions.


1. Describe different ways to put 00h in AX.

2. What does the org 100h directive mean?

3. What is the purpose in commenting your code?

4. Are there any downsides of commenting your code?

5. What is the purpose of the IP?

6. What are the general purpose registers?

7. What is the relationship between AH/AL and AX?

8. What is an offset?

9. What is the difference between CS and DS?

10. What do you think would happen if in Toad "comsig" is defined as "*.*",0?

11. What does the Toad virus do to an infected file?

12. In eat_fly, why does AX have to be moved to BX?

13. What is the purpose of get_fly written after end?
