SPo0ky for running the best virii group around.
Arsonic for being quite a relief from coding.
Opic for being quite the fast learner.
Toad for running the zine.
F-Prot, for letting me test my encryption against it.
T-Bav, for the same reason. I kicked both their asses.

Ralph Brown for making the virus coder's best friend (Interrupt List).
Sliced bread for being the best thing since non-sliced bread.
VDAT creator Cicatrix for making the virus coder's good buddy.
~knzyvo} again, I pay homage to you... *Sea4 bows reverently*.
Amanda, (my computer) for taking every single glich I could dish out.
Non-Sliced bread for being the best thing since dirt. (not very good with butter)
Ralev who is just joining the game.

Ms. Dos for being the best operating system ever.
Ms. Dos Editor for being the best text editor ever.
