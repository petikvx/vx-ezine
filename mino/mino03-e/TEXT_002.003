Fucking with Call Back Verification...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     OK, this theme is very simple.  First, let's look at Call Back
Verification and how it works: 

     Call Back Verification is a method used for automatic verification. 
It's supposed to soothe the system operator's (SysOp) mind when validating
new users.  The hotshot sysop gets one of these and that's all he needs (or
so he thinks).

     The traditional form of validation is as follows:  We call a BBS, the
system answers and gets our particulars (name or handle, phone number, etc.).
Within the next 48 or so hours after our call, the sysop calls us to verify
that all the information we gave is correct.

     This method of verification makes it difficult to get bogus accounts on
a BBS since the sysop personally verifies the information.  Unless you get a
hold of some fool, or you "steal" someone's password, it's a real bitch.  Or
you can try playing on his sympathies, but that won't even get you on a
pirate BBS.

     The other way to validate is Call Back and it works as follows:
We call the BBS and all that shit I said before  :-).  But in this case, the
operator doesn't intervene in the validation process.  Instead, when you hang
up, the system itself calls us back and verifies the data.  The sysop doesn't
even have to be aware of what's going on.....Good point!  When we get the
call, the system asks us to enter the password we had decided on before.  If
we enter it correctly, we are validated.  If not, the system makes note of us
or locks us out completely.  It depends on the system.

     Now that we know what it is and how it works, let's think of a way we
can spoof it.....  Hhhmmmmm.... (Genius at work)  Got It!!  :-)  Think about
it... What happens when we call someone and that person hangs up?  If he
wants to use the phone again, he has to wait until WE'RE good and ready to
hang up.  Why?  Because when we originate the call, WE have control over the
line. (TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: This may be true in Argentina.  Here in the US the
phone company forces a line drop after about 10 seconds....  At least, that's
the way it tested out after a number of both long distance and local calls.)

     Anyhow, here's how it goes:  We're connected to the BBS and we want to
hang up so the BBS call back to validate us.  But since we are already
connected, why not take advantage of the opportunity?  Huh?  Huh?  So Ok, we
hang up, but not really.  We exit the BBS through the Goodbye option or
whatever, so that THEY hang up first.  Immediately we should pick up the hand
set and keep the communications going "by hand", because our modem detects
the CARRIER DROP and will drop us, too.  That's why we let the idiot hang up
and wee pick up the handset.  At that moment, there is no communication
between us and the BBS, but the line is still "live".

     All right, then all we need to do is wait for the BBS to dial back the
number we gave it and pick up the communications with the BBS again.   But
here's another problem... unless the BBS hears a dial tone on its line, it
won't dial us back....  Hmmmmm......  How would we solve that?  Anyone have
an idea?....  Hmmmm?

Drako:  Over here, professor!
Professor:  Yes, student Drako?
Drako:  What if we send a previously recorded dial tone over the line?
Professor:  Excellent idea, young Drako!

     OK, we've solved the problem by using my idea!  The BBS dials us and
finds us at the end of the line, impatiently waiting for that pseudo-call
with a nice juicy CARRIER, produced by the Hayes command, "ATA".

     Everything fine up to here, but many BBSs which use this system use
several phone lines.  That complicates things...  Why?  Because the BBS will
use a different line to call us back.  Generally, BBSs which have more than
one line have consecutive numbers, or maybe just close together.  It's
possible that one of the numbers is dedicated exclusively to Call Backs.  It
is then simply a matter of scanning the numbers and then trying the scam
we've just described on each line until it works.

     With this method, we can validate an account on a BBS with Call Back
without the Sysop ever finding out.  Hope you can use this:
