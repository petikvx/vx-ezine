Minotauro Magazine Issue n§3..

     Hi readers.. I ask myself: Don't you have anything better to do, than to
sit around reading these "un-sanctified" publications?  Well, if that's the
case, welcome to Edition n§3 of Minotauro Magazine..

     After a quick, superficial view of this magazine, you will notice that
we have officially incorporated Lapidario as one of our writers....
Officially, because before, due to a "nervous shock" (work related :-) ), he
had no time to write (to hell with it....!!).

     Last Minute News: The struggle against the 0-0 days \/\/areZ d00dz has
intensified...  Their chief, super Luck Martins (also known as Murray of the
TV series 'Dock 56', has threatened our friend of the Satanic Brain BBS with
destruction...  Ooohh!!  Please, God!!  Don't do it... all of us programmers
in the world beg you not to do it!!!  But he, with his 0-0 day warez, has
created a bomb to blow the whole BBS to shit!...  But since he obviously
hadn't finished reading his 0-0 day \/\/arez d00d manual, he never got to the
part that says: "Never test a logic bomb on your own machine!".
Hahaha! the dumb shit fucked up his machine and ended up with 0-0 Megs
warez..
Hahaha... Anyhow, this was just a cautionary tale to warn you of just how far
the warez fever can go, which, even if you don't believe it, has more than 2
adepts... poor souls...  please, a minute of silence for our poor departed
brothers....

     Changing the subject, we've started a contest in which we'll award a
2400 baud modem to the best article submitted by our readers, to be published
in future editions of this magazine.  Yep, you heard it right ;)  Sooo... you
know ;)
