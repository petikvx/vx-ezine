Automatic Anwering Machines. ;)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 OK, we spoke about some types of phreaking in the previous article,
especially the use of Blue Boxing on Argentina, for those who wanted to begin
with that or had done some blue boxing but had no idea of what they were
doing.

 This time I want to talk about something basic, so as to run some trials. We
won't gain any benefits, such as free calls, but it's a good way to learn how
to use access codes and have a lot of fun, too.  I'm talking about automatic
answering machines.

 Many people have answering machines at home (I hate them) and in some models
it's possible to hack into their messages, and other options, by using tones.

In other words, by calling from another phone and using touch tones we check
"our" answering machine.  Why not get into our hateful neighbor's answering
machine and listen to his/her messages?  It's good fun, and it gives us a
start on phreaking and become familiar with access codes since, if at some
point in the future we intend to hack a PBX we'll have to enter an access
code.

 Obviously we must use touch tone to enter these access codes.  These codes
may vary from 2 to 5 digits:  the greater the number of functions, the more
digits the access codes will have.

 But which is the most popular brand of answering machines?

 !- PANASONIC -!

 Most people own Panasonic model which use only 2 digit access codes.  This
makes it simple to find the code since the access codes range from 00 to 99. 
Even better, by sending the following string we have sent all the codes:

 01122334455667788991357902468036925814715937049483827261605172959628408529
 639974197531864209876543210

 But if we keep in mind that most Panasonic models don't use all the digits
between 0 and 9, just some of them, we only need to send some combinations,
such as:

 33556636653

 Once we enter the correct code, the answering machine will emit a series of
beeps and wait for us to enter a command, which for the more conventional
Panasonic models are as follows:

 1 - Back one message
 2 - Forward to next message
 3 - RESET
 5 - PLAY
 6 - Room monitoring
 7 - Record receive message
 9 - End receive message
 0 - Discontect answering machine
 * - Skip Message

 Function '*': This lets us bypass the welcome message, and start to record
               the message or send code to the machine.

 Function '1': Go back one message and play it back.

 Function '2': Go to the next message.

 Function '3': Resets the answering machine.  The machine goes to message 0
               and any new messages will overwrite what was there.

 Function '5': Plays any messages recorded on the answering machine.

 Function '6': Let's us listen in on what's happening where we called, since
               the machine's internal microphone is activated.  Not of much
               use, only let's us know if someone is in the house or some
               other crap.

 Function '7': This is one of the more interesting ones.  We can tape a
               message an incoming call will hear.  We can do a number of
               things with this, such as recording any old shit.  Or we can
               arrange to have a call-girl visit our 'FRIEND'S" house.  When
               they call back the number we give them to verify, they'll get
               the answering machine on which we've recorded a message like:
               'Yeah, I made the call" or some other crap.  In order for this
               to work you have to time the recording just right so that the
               caller thinks he/she is talking to a "real" person.

  Another thing to do is to have some friend in a foreign country make a
collect call to the number whose machine we've hacked.  When the operator
reaches the number the answering machine will say something like:

 - Hello? <PAUSE> Yes I accept the Call.

  We do this to someone we hate, because if we do it enough times, the poor
fuck will have a "small" additional charge on his telephone bill.  ;-)

 Function '8': This is used after funtion 7 to tell the machine we have
               finished recording the "welcoming: message.

 Function '0': This disconnects the auto-answer feature,  This is not a total
               disconnect, because if we call and let the phone ring 15
               times, the auto-answer will reconnect

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴 Other answering machine brands 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
 These functions apply to AT&T answering machines and may work with some
other brands:

 1 Back
 2 Repeat
 3 Forward
 4 Record "welcome" message (press again to terminate record mode)
 5 Stop
 6 Record messages
 8 Play >
 9 Disconnect auto-answer
 0 Date and time stamp

  Things get complicated if the code has more than 2 digits, but keep in mind
that few people use the remote access feature, and many don't even know what
it is!  So... no one gets hot if the code has been changed (you can't change
it on some).  Always try the defaults first:

 1111,0000,1234,9999 and such.

 Some of the the newer models have an interesting feature: when a message is
left, it will call a preset number and forward the message.  This type of
machine has 4 or 5 digit codes, but if we can crack it we can set it to make
international calls.  It would be even better if we could be there when the
guy gets his phone bill!

 Hope ya have a lot of fun with this, and get some practice hacking the
codes!
