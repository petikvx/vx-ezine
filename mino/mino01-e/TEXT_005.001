Hiding viruses, troyans...

   I got these tricks from several 'zines which, now that I know of
them, are pretty damn obvious.......

   Imagine you have an unencrypted virus which is detectable
through heuristic scanning, or a troyan which is recognized as a
program which performs "suspicious disk accesses".  To avoid these
situations all we need to do is PKLITE them.  If you didn't know
about this before, PKLITE is a file compressing program for
executables (the executables can still run after compression).
Once I've PKLITEd the file, its "physical" structure changes making
it "invisible" to heuristic scanners and bomb-checkers.

   One possible problem is CHK4LITE, which internally checks a
compressed executable.  But don't despair, the compressed file has
a header which reads:

 "PKLITE Copr.........Reserved" followed by "Not Enough Memory$"

   All that need be done is to erase the header or overwrite it
with garbage.  But don't erase the "$".  That's never erased.

   With this we are assured a clean, problem-free entry.  But
remember, the virus is "modified" only by hand.  It goes back to
being a "normal" virus the first time it infects.
