Stealing passwords...
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 (I want to make clear that these are some ballsy techniques, but
that doesn't mean they are not effective).  :)

 Who hasn't, at one time or another, wanted some friend's password
to that subscription BBS you've wanted to get into for so long?
Well, there are many ways to do that:

 If your "friend" is kinda stupid, you could ask him right off for
his TELIX.FON file, or whatever.  This is not the most advisable
way of stealing a password, because if he should notice that
something is not right, I'd be the first to be blamed (well, in
this case, YOU!).

 Another method is to ask him for his entire telecommunications
package; that way it wouldn't be so obvious.  But the method I
prefer (if I know the guy and can go to his home) is to copy by
hand his telephone list while he is distracted.  Now that you have
his passwords, all that remains is to call and VIOLATE (using the
"bad" meaning of the word) that juicy account.

 If, however, we don't know the individual, but we do know that he
is a member of a particular BBS, all we have to do is:
 A) Find out his phone number
 B) Make like you are a security guy

 With these two items we're half way there.  Now all we need is a
little luck...... luck which depends on who answers.  Someone with
even a 10% intellectual coefficient won't give you his password
even if you kill him, but it doesn't hurt to try.  Ultimately, you
can drop the line and that's it!

 We call........ someone answers....... and we start the scam.
 First, you have to keep well in mind the name of the BBS..... no
hesitation.
 One of the best (and oldest) scams is to make like you are the BBS
sysop.  Using the excuse that your user base has been corrupted and
that we need his personal info again, we ask him for them again.
We start a conversation and whenever we feel it's the best moment
we ask the Million Dollar Question:  What was your last password?

 -We're in suspense....-

 After a few seconds the silence is broken!  Our victim has fallen
for the scam.
 Once we have his password, don't despair.  First, we must make
sure that it isn't too obvious that we've obtained what we wanted
so we continue the conversation for a while.  After the "hugs and
kisses", we call up the new BBS as quickly as possible.

 OK, now I want hack into all the world's BBS's and see all of you
sniffing around there..........
                       Yours faithful, Drako.
