Welcome to the first edition of Minotauro Magazine  (c) Minotauro
Group.
First, a few words from the authors:

 As you will see, the is the first ASCII format magazine which
reflects "the information" underworld (in Spanish).  What we've
tried to do is to collect as much information as possible and put
it in a package, so as to not have to wonder "where did I put the
.exe formats" or "how the fuck do you spoof V-Safe" (ptooie!).

 As to the frequency of this magazine, we do not have a set
timeframe.  It could be a week or it could be 2 months.  It all
depends on how much info we can collect.  We would, however, like
your support so that this work moves ahead.  Any information will
be welcome.

If you have any doubts, you can find us at these fine Buenos Aires
BBSs

     Dionysios II   253-2098

Well, that's enough!  Lets get to work!
