MICROSOFT PORTABLE EXECUTABLE AND COMMON OBJECT FILE FORMAT

Visual C++ Business Unit
Microsoft Corporation
Revision 4.1  AUGUST 1994
 

Note This document is provided to aid in the development of tools and
     applications for Microsoft Windows NT but is not guaranteed to be a
     complete specification in all respects. Microsoft reserves the right to
     alter this document without notice.

1. GENERAL CONCEPTS
 
This document specifies the structure of executable (image) files and object
files under Microsoft Windows NT. These files are referred to as Portable
Executable (PE) or Common Object File Format (COFF) files. The name `Portable
Executable' refers to the fact that the format is not architecture-specific.
Certain concepts appear repeatedly througout the specification and are
described in the following table:
Name                     Description
Image file               Executable file: either a .EXE file or a DLL. An
			 image file can be thought of as a `memory image.' The
			 term `image file' is usually used instead of
			 `executable file,' because the latter sometimes is
			 taken to mean only a .EXE file. 
Object file              A file given as input to the linker. The linker
			 produces an image file, which in turn is used as
			 input by the loader. The term `object file' does not
			 necessarily imply any connection to object-oriented
			 programming.
RVA  Relative            Virtual Address. In an image file, an RVA is always
			 the address of an item once loaded into memory, with
			 the base address of the image file subtracted from
			 it. The RVA of an item will almost always differ from
			 its position within the file on disk (File
			 Pointer).In an object file, an RVA is less meaningful
			 because memory locations are not assigned. In this
			 case, an RVA would be an address within a section
			 (see below), to which a relocation is later applied
			 during linking. For simplicity, compilers should just
			 set the first RVA in each section to zero.
Virtual Address (VA)     Same as RVA (see above), except that the base address
			 of the image file is not subtracted. The address is
			 called a `Virtual Address' because Windows NT creates
			 a distinct virtual address space for each process,
			 independent of physical memory. For almost all
			 purposes, a virtual address should be considered just
			 an address. A virtual address is not as predictable
			 as an RVA, because the loader might not load the
			 image at its preferred location.
File pointer             Location of an item within the file itself, before
			 being processed by the linker (in the case of object
			 files) or the loader (in the case of image files). In
			 other words, this is a position within the file as
			 stored on disk.
Date/Time Stamp          Date/time stamps are used in a number of places in a
			 PE/COFF file, and for different purposes. The format
			 of each such stamp, however, is always the same: that
			 used by the time functions in the C run-time library.
Section                  A section is the basic unit of code or data within a
			 PE/COFF file. In an object file, for example, all
			 code can be combined within a single section, or
			 (depending on compiler behavior) each function can
			 occupy its own section. With more sections, there is
			 more file overhead, but the linker is able to link in
			 code more selectively. A section is vaguely similar
			 to a segment in Intel 8086 architecture. All the raw
			 data in a section must be loaded contiguously. In
			 addition, an image file can contain a number of
			 sections, such as .tls or .debug, that have special
			 purposes.

3. FILE HEADERS

The PE/COFF file headers consist of an MS-DOS stub, file signature, COFF
Header, and Optional Header. An object file usually contains only the COFF
Header, but an image file contains all the headers. In both cases, the file
headers are followed immediately by section headers.

3.1 MS-DOS STUB IMAGE (Image Only)
The MS-DOS Stub is a valid application that runs under MS-DOS and is placed at
the front of the .EXE image. The linker places a default stub here, which
prints out the message `This program cannot be run in DOS mode' when the image
is run in MS-DOS. The user can specify another stub by using the /STUB linker
option.
At location 0x3c, the stub has the file offset to the Portable Executable (PE)
signature. This information enables Windows NT to properly execute the image
file, even though it has a DOS Stub. This file offset is placed at location
0x3c during linking.

 
3.2 Signature (Image Only)
After the MS-DOS stub, there is a 4-byte signature identifying the file as a
PE format image file; this format is used in Win32, Posix on NT, and for some
device drivers in Windows NT. Currently, this signature is `PE\0\0' (the
letters `P' and `E' followed by two null bytes).

3.3 COFF Header ( Object & Image)
At the beginning of an object file, or immediately after the signature of an
image file, there is a standard COFF header of the following format. Note that
the Windows NT loader limts the Number of Sections to 96.
Offset    Size Field          Description

0    2    Machine                  Number identifying type of target machine.
				   See Section 3.3.1, `Machine Types, ' for
				   more information.
2    2    Number of Sections       Number of sections; indicates size of the
				   Section Table, which immediately follows
				   the headers.
4    4    Time/Date Stamp          Time and date the file was created.
8    4    Pointer to Symbol Table  Offset, within the COFF file, of the symbol
				   table.
12   4    Number of Symbols        Number of entries in the symbol table. This
				   data can be used in locating the string ta-
				   ble, which immediately follows the symbol
				   table.
16   2    Optional Header Size     Size of the optional header, which is
				   included for executable files but not
				   object files. An object file should have a
				   value of 0 here. The format is described in
				   the section `Optional Header.'
18   2    Characteristics          Flags indicating attributes of the file.
				   See Section 3.3.2, `Characteristics,' for
				   specific flag values.

3.3.1. Machine Types
The Machine field has one of the following values, defined below, which
specify its machine (CPU) type. An image file can be run only on the specified
machine, or a system emulating it.
Constant                      Value     Description

IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_UNKNOWN    0x0       Contents assumed to be applicable to
					any machine type.
IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_I386       0x14c     Intel 386 or later, and compatible
					processors.
IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_R4000      0x166     MIPS little endian.
IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_ALPHA      0x184     Alpha AXP'.
IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_M68K       0x268     Motorola 68000 series.
IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_POWERPC    0x1F0     Power PC, little endian.
IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_PARISC     0x290     Precision Architecture (PA) RISC
					processor.

3.3.2. Characteristics
The Characteristics field contains flags that indicate attributes of the
object or image file. The following flags are currently defined:
Flag                          Value     Description

IMAGE_FILE_RELOCS_STRIPPED    0x0001    Image only. Indicates that the file
					does not contain base relocations and
					must therefore be loaded at its
					preferred base address. If the base
					address is not available, the loader
					reports an error. Operating systems
					running on top of MS-DOS (Win32s') are
					generally not able to use the
					preferred  base address and so cannot
					run these images. However, beginning
					with version 4.0, Windows will use an
					application's preferred base address.
IMAGE_FILE_EXECUTABLE_IMAGE   0x0002    Image only. Indicates that the image
					file is valid and can be run. If this
					flag is not set, it generally
					indicates a linker error.
IMAGE_FILE_LINE_NUMS_STRIPPED 0x0004    COFF line numbers have been removed.
IMAGE_FILE_LOCAL_SYMS_STRIPPED 0x0008   COFF symbol table entries for local
					symbols have been removed.
IMAGE_FILE_MINIMAL_OBJECT     0x0010    Reserved for future use.
IMAGE_FILE_UPDATE_OBJECT      0x0020    Reserved for future use.
IMAGE_FILE_16BIT_MACHINE      0x0040    Use of this flag is reserved for
					future use.
IMAGE_FILE_BYTES_REVERSED_LO  0x0080    Little endian: LSB precedes MSB in
					memory.
IMAGE_FILE_32BIT_MACHINE      0x0100    Machine based on 32-bit-word architec-
					ture.
IMAGE_FILE_DEBUG_STRIPPED     0x0200    Debugging information removed from
					image file.
IMAGE_FILE_PATCH              0x0400    Reserved for future use.
IMAGE_FILE_SYSTEM             0x1000    The image file is a system file, not a
					user program.
IMAGE_FILE_DLL                0x2000    The image file is a dynamic-link li-
					brary (DLL). Such files are considered
					executable files for almost all
					purposes, although they cannot be
					directly run.
IMAGE_FILE_BYTES_REVERSED_HI  0x8000    Big endian: MSB precedes LSB in
					memory.

 
3.4 Optional Header (Usually image only)
Every image file has an Optional Header that provides information to the
loader. This header is also referred to the PE Header. This header is optional
in the sense that some files (specifically, object files) do not have it. For
image files, this header is required. An object file may have an optional
header, but generally an this header has no function in an object file except
to increase size. 
The Optional Header itself has three major parts:
Offset    Size Header part    Description

0         28                  Standard fields     These are defined for all
			      implementations of COFF, including UNIX.
28        68                  NT-specific fields  These include additional
			      fields to support specific features of Windows
			      NT (for example, subsystem).
96        128                 Data directories    These fields are
			      address/size pairs for special tables, found in
			      the image file and  used by the operating system
			      (for example, Import Table and Export Table).

3.4.1. Optional Header Standard Fields (Image Only)
The first nine fields of the Optional Header are standard fields, defined for
every implementation of COFF. These fields contain general information useful
for loading and running an executable file.
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         2              Magic     Unsigned integer identifying the state of
			 the image file. The most common number is 0413 octal
			 (0x10B), identifying it as a normal executable file.
			 0407 (0x107) identifies a ROM image.
2         1              LMajor    Linker major version number.
3         1              LMinor    Linker minor version number.
4         4              Code Size Size of the code (text) section, or the sum
			 of all code sections if there are multiple sections.
8         4              Initialized Data Size    Size of the initialized data
			 section, or the sum of all such sections if there are
			 multiple data sections.
12        4              Uninitialized Data Size  Size of the uninitialized
			 data section (BSS), or the sum of all such sections
			 if there are multiple BSS sections.
16        4              Entry Point RVA     Address of entry point, relative
			 to image base, when executable file is loaded into
			 memory. For program images, this is the starting
			 address. For device drivers, this is the address of
			 the initialization function.
20        4              Base Of Code   Address, realtive to image base, of
			 beginning of code section, when loaded into memory.
24        4              Base Of Data   Address, realtive to image base, of
			 beginning of data section, when loaded into memory.

3.4.2. Optional Header Windows NT-Specific Fields (Image Only)
The next twenty-one fields are an extension to the COFF Optional Header format
and contain additional information needed by the linker and loader in Windows
NT.
Offset    Size Field     Description

28        4              Image Base     Preferred address of first byte of
			 image when loaded into memory; must be a multiple of
			 64K.
32        4              Section Alignment   Alignment (in bytes) of sections
			 when loaded into memory. Must greater or equal to
			 File Alignment. Default is the page size for the
			 architecture.
36        4              File Alignment Alignment factor (in bytes) used to
			 align pages in image file. The value should be a
			 power of 2 between 512 and 64K inclusive.
40        2              OS Major  Major version number of required OS.
42        2              OS Minor  Minor version number of required OS.
44        2              User Major     Major version number of image.
46        2              User Minor     Minor version number of image.
48        2              SubSys Major   Major version number of subsystem.
50        2              SubSys Minor   Minor version number of subsystem.

52        4              Reserved

56        4              Image Size     Size, in bytes, of image, including
			 all headers; must be a multiple of Section Alignment.
60        4              Header Size    Combined size of MS-DOS Header, PE
			 Header, and Object Table.
64        4              File Checksum  Image file checksum. The algorithm for
			 computing is incorporated into IMAGHELP.DLL. The
			 following are checked for validation at load time:
			 all drivers, any DLL loaded at boot time, and any DLL
			 that ends up in the server.
68        2              SubSystem Subsystem required to run this image. See
			 `Windows NT Subsystem' below for more information.
70        2              DLL Flags Obsolete.
72        4              Stack Reserve Size  Size of stack to reserve. Only
			 the Stack Commit Size is committed; the rest is made
			 available one page at a time, until reserve size is
			 reached.
76        4              Stack Commit Size   Size of stack to commit.
80        4              Heap Reserve Size   Size of local heap space to
			 reserve. Only the Heap Commit Size is committed; the
					 rest is made available one page at a
time, until
					 reserve size is reached.
84        4              Heap Commit Size    Size of local heap space to
			 commit.
88        4              Loader Flags   Obsolete.
92        4              Number of Data Directories    Number of data-dic-
			 tionary entries in the remainder of the Optional
			 Header. Each describes a location and size.

Windows NT Subsystem
The following values are defined for the Subsystem field of the Optional
Header. They determine what, if any, Windows NT subsystem is required to run
the image.
Constant                      Value     Description

IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_UNKNOWN       0         Unknown subsystem.
IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_NATIVE        1         Used for device drivers and native
					Windows NT processes.
IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_GUI   2         Image runs in the Windows' graphical
					user interface (GUI) subsystem.
IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_CUI   3         Image runs in the Windows character
					subsystem.
IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_POSIX_CUI     7         Image runs in the Posix character
					subsystem.

3.4.3. Optional Header Data Directories (Image Only)
Each data directory gives the address and size of a table or string used by
Windows NT. These are all loaded into memory so that they can be used by the
system at run time. A data directory is an eight-byte field that has the
following declaration:
 
typedef struct _IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY {
    DWORD   RVA;
    DWORD   Size;
} IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY;

The first field, RVA, is the relative virtual address of the table. The RVA is
the address of the table, when loaded, relative to the base address of the
image. The second field gives the size in bytes. The data directories, which
form the last part of the Optional Header, are listed below.
Offset    Size Field     Description

96        8    Export Table   Export Table address and size.
104       8    Import Table   Import Table address and size
112       8    Resource Table Resource Table address and size.
120       8    Exception Table     Exception Table address and size.
128       8    Security Table Security Table address and size. Unusued.
136       8    Base Relocation Table    Base Relocation Table address and
			 size.
144       8    Debug     Debug data starting address and size.
152       8    Copyright Copyright string address and length.
160       8    Global Ptr     Relative virtual address of the global pointer
	       register. Size member of this structure is set to 0.
168       8    TLS Table Thread Local Storage (TLS) Table address and size.
176       8    Load Config Table   Load Configuration Table address and size.
184       40   Reserved

 

4. Section Table (Section Headers)
Each row of the Section Table, in effect, is a section header. This table
immediately follows the COFF optional header, if any. This positioning is
required because the file header does not contain a direct pointer to the
section table; the location of the section table is determined by calculating
the location of the first byte after the headers.
The number of entries in the Section Table is given by the Number of Sections
field in the COFF header. Entries in the Section Table are numbered starting
from one. The code and data memory section entries are in the order chosen by
the linker.
In an image file, the virtual addresses for sections must be assigned by the
linker such that they are in ascending order and adjacent, and they must be a
multiple of the Section Align value in the optional header.
Each section header (Section Table entry) has the following format, for a
total of 40 bytes per entry:
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         8              Section Name   An eight-byte, null-padded ASCII
			 string. There is no terminating null if the string is
			 exactly eight bytes long. For longer names, this
			 field contains a slash (/) followed by ASCII
			 representation of a decimal number: this number is an
			 offset into the string table.
8         4              Virtual Size   Total size of the section when loaded
			 into memory. If this value is greater than Size of
			 Raw Data, the section is zero-padded. This field is
			 valid only for image files and should be set to 0 for
			 object files.
12        4              RVA/Offset     Address of the first byte of the sec-
			 tion, when loaded into memory, relative to the image
			 base. For object files, this field is the address of
			 the first byte before relocation is applied; for
			 simplicity, compilers should set this to zero.
			 Otherwise, it is an arbitrary value that is
			 subtracted from offsets during relocation.
16        4              Size of Raw Data    Size of the section (object file)
			 or size of the initialized data on disk (image

4.2 Grouped Sections (Object Only)
The `$' character (dollar sign) has a special interpretation in section names
in object files.
When determining the image section that will contain the contents of an object
section, the linker discards the `$' and all characters following it. Thus, an
object section named .text$X will actually contribute to the .text section in
the image.
However, the characters following the `$' determine the ordering of the
contributions to the image section. All contributions with the same
object-section name will be allocated contiguously in the image, and the
blocks of contributions will be sorted in lexical order by object-section
name. Therefore, everything in object files with section name .text$X will end
up together, after the .text$W contributions and before the .text$Y
contributions.
The section name in an image file will never contain a `$' character.

 
5. Other Contents of file
The data structures described so far, up to and including the Section Table,
are all located at a fixed offset from the beginning of the file (or from the
PE header if the file is an image containing an MS-DOS stub).
The remainder of a COFF object or image file contains blocks of data that are
not necessarily at any specific file offset. Instead the locations are defined
by pointers in the Optional Header or a section header.
An exception is for images with a Section Alignment value (see the Optional
Header description) of less than the page size of the architecture (4K for
Intel x86 and for MIPS; 8K for Alpha). In this case there are constraints on
the file offset of the section data, as described in the next section. Another
exception is that debug information must be placed at the very end of an image
file, becuase the loader does not map the .debug section into memory. The rule
on debug information does not apply to object files, however.

 
5.1 Section Data
Initialized data for a section consists of simple blocks of bytes. There is no
iterated-data mechanism as there is for 16-bit executable files. However, for
sections containing all zeros, the section data need not be included.
The data for each section is located at the file offset given by the Pointer
to Raw Data field in the section header, and the size of this data in the file
is indicated by the Size of Raw Data field. If the Size of Raw Data is less
than the Virtual Size, the remainder is padded with zeros.
In an image file, the section data must be aligned on a boundary as specified
by the File Align field in the image optional header. Section data must appear
in order of the RVA values for the corresponding sections (as do the
individual section headers in the Section Table).
There are additional restrictions on image files for which the Section Align
value in the Optional Header is less than the page size of the architecture.
For such files, the location of section data in the file must match its
location in memory when the image is loaded, so that the physical offset for
section data is the same as the RVA. 

 
5.2 COFF Relocations (Object Only)
Object files contain COFF relocations, which specify how the section data
should be modified when placed in the image file and subsequently loaded into
memory.
Image files do not contain COFF relocations, because all symbols referenced
have already been assigned addresses in a flat address space. An image
contains relocation information in the form of base relocations in the .reloc
section (unless the image has the IMAGE_FILE_RELOCS_STRIPPED attribute). See
Section 6.5 for more information.
For each section in an obejct file, there is an array of fixed-length records
that are the section's COFF relocations. The position and length of the array
are specified in the section header. Each element of the array has the
following format:
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         4              Offset    Address of the item to which relocation is
			 applied: this is the offset from the beginning of the
			 section, plus the value of the section's RVA/Offset
			 field (see Section 4, `Section Table.'). For example,
			 if the first byte of the section has an address of
			 0x10, the third byte has an address of 0x12.
4         4              Symbol Table Index  A zero-based index into the
			 symbol table. This symbol gives the address to be
			 used for the relocation. If the specified symbol has
			 section storage class, then the symbol's address is
			 the address with the first section of the same name.
8         2              Type A value indicating what kind of relocation
			 should be performed. Valid relocation types depend on
			 machine type. See Section 5.2.1, `Type Indicators.'

If the symbol referred to (by the Symbol Table Index field) has storage class
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_SECTION, the symbol's address is the beginning of the section.
The section is usually in the same file, except when the object file is part
of an archive (library). In that case, the section may be found in any other
object file in the archive that has the same archive-member name as the
current object file. (The relationship with the archive-member name is used in
the linking of import tables, i.e. the .idata section.)

5.2.1. Type Indicators
The Type field of the relocation record indicates what kind of relocation
should be performed. Different relocation types are defined for each type of
machine.
Intel386
The following relocation Type indicators are defined for Intel386 and
compatible processors:
Constant                 Value     Description

IMAGE_REL_I386_ABSOLUTE  0         No location is necessary; reference is to
				   an absolute value.

IMAGE_REL_I386_REL16     2         Not supported.
IMAGE_REL_I386_DIR32     3         Direct 32-bit reference to the symbol's
				   virtual address.
IMAGE_REL_I386_DIR32NB   7         Direct 32-bit reference to the symbol's
				   virtual address, minus the base. This is a
				   relative virtual address.
IMAGE_REL_I386_SEG12     9         Not supported.
IMAGE_REL_I386_SECTION   0xA       Reference to a section address. A common

				   address. Has same general purpose as
				   IMAGE_REL_I386_SECTION.
IMAGE_REL_I386_REL32     0x14      Program-counter-relative 32-bit reference
				   to the symbol's virtual address. This is
				   usually a code reference.

MIPS Processors
The following relocation Type indicators are defined for MIPS processors:
Constant                 Value     Description

IMAGE_REL_MIPS_ABSOLUTE  0         No location is necessary; reference is to
				   an absolute value.

IMAGE_REL_MIPS_REFWORD   2         Direct reference to a 32-bit address. With
				   RISC architecture, such an address cannot
				   fit into a single instruction, so this
				   reference is likely pointer data.
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_JMPADDR   3         Displacement to a code (jump) address.
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_REFHI     4         Reference to the high portion of a 32-bit
				   address. Used for the first instruction in
				   a two-instruction sequence that loads a
				   full address. REFHI must be followed by
				   PAIR and REFLO relocations.
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_REFLO     5         Reference to the low portion of a 32-bit
				   address.

				   bugging information, which reside in
				   separate .debug sections.
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_SECREL    11        Reference to an offset from a section
				   address. Has same general purpose as
				   IMAGE_REL_MIPS_SECTION.
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_REFWORDNB 34        Direct reference to a 32-bit address which
				   is relative to the image base. This address
				   is a linker-generated thunk.
IMAGE_REL_MIPS_PAIR      35        Relocation connecting a REFHI and a REFLO
				   relocation pair. A REFHI relocation must be
				   followed by a relocation of this type.

Alpha Processors
The following relocation Type indicators are defined for Alpha processors:
Constant                 Value     Description

IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_ABSOLUTE      0    No location is necessary; reference is to
				   an absolute value.

IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFQUAD       2    Direct reference to a 64-bit address.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_GPREL32       3    Reference to a 32-bit address that is
				   relative to the Global Pointer (GP)
				   register.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_LITERAL       4    Low 16 bits of a 32-bit displacement from
				   the Global Pointer (GP) register.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_LITUSE        5    High 16 bits of a 32-bit displacement from
				   the GP register.

				   Global Pointer (GP) register.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_BRADDR        7    Displacement to a code (jump) address.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_HINT          8    Hint to the processor indicating which
				   cache line will be loaded into the Ins-
				   truction cache, for the target of a jump.
				   If correct, the hint eliminates the
				   branch-delay-slot.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_INLINE_REFLONG 9   Reference to a 32-bit address spread over
				   two instructions; followed by either an
				   ABSOLUTE or MATCH relocation.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFHI         10   Reference to the high portion of a 32-bit
				   address. Used for the first instruction in
				   a two-instruction sequence that loads a
				   full address. REFHI must be followed by
				   PAIR and REFLO relocations.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFLO         11   Reference to the low portion of a 32-bit
				   address.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_PAIR          12   Relocation connecting a REFHI and a REFLO

				   contains a value that is the low 16 bits of
				   the HI/PAIR/LO relocation sequence.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_MATCH         13   Relocation following an INLINE_REFLONG. The
				   symbol table index does not indicate which
				   symbol the relocation is tied to, but
				   indicates the displacement in bytes of the
				   instruction with the matching low address.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_SECTION       14   Reference to a section address. A common
				   use is to facilitate references to de-
				   bugging information, which reside in
				   separate .debug sections.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_SECREL        15   Reference to an offset from a section ad-
				   dress. Has same general purpose as IMAGE_-
				   REL_ALPHA_SECTION.
IMAGE_REL_ALPHA_REFLONGNB     16   Reference to a 32-bit address relative to
				   the image base. This is always a
				   linker-generated thunk.

 
5.3 COFF Line Numbers
COFF line numbers indicate the relationship between code and line-numbers in
source files. The Microsoft format for COFF line numbers is similar to
standard COFF, but it has been extended to allow a single section to relate to
line numbers in multiple source files.
COFF line numbers consist of an array of fixed-length records. The location
(file offset) and size of the array are specified in the section header. Each
line-number record is of the following format:
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         4              Type (*)  Union of two fields: Symbol Table Index and
			 RVA. Whether Symbol Table Index or RVA is used
			 depends on the value of Linenumber.
4         2              Linenumber     When nonzero, this field specifies a
			 one-based line number. When zero, the Type field is
			 interpreted as a Symbol Table Index for a function.

The Type field is a union of two four-byte fields, Symbol Table Index, and
RVA:
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         4              Symbol Table Index  Used when Linenumber is 0: index
			 to symbol table entry for a function. This format is
			 used to indicate the function that a group of
			 line-number records refer to.
0         4              RVA  Used when Linenumber is greater than 0: relative
			 virtual address of the executable code that
			 corresponds to the source line indicated. (In an
			 object file, the RVA is relative to the section.)

A line-number record, then, can either set the Linenumber field to 0 and point
to a function definition in the Symbol Table, or else it can work as a
standard line-number entry by giving a positive integer (line number) and the
corresponding address in the object code.
A group of line-number entries always begins with the first format: the index
of a function symbol. If this is the first line-number record in the section,
then it is also the COMDAT symbol name for the function if the section's
COMDAT flag is set. (See Section 5.5.6, `COMDAT Sections.') The function's
auxiliary record in the Symbol Table has a Pointer to Linenumbers field that
points to this same line-number record.
A record identifying a function is followed by any number of line-number
entries that give actual line-number information (Linenumber greater than
zero). These entries are one-based, relative to the beginning of the function,
and represent every source line in the function except for the first one.
For example, the first line-number record for the following example would
specify the ReverseSign function (Symbol Table Index of ReverseSign,
Linenumber set to 0). Then records with Linenumber values of 1, 2, and 3 would
follow, corresponding to source lines as shown:
 
    // some code precedes ReverseSign function

     int  ReverseSign(int i)
1:   {
2:        return -1 * i;
3:   }


 
5.4 COFF Symbol Table
The Symbol Table described in this section is inherited from the traditional
COFF format. It is distinct from CodeView® information. A file may contain
both a COFF Symbol Table and CodeView debug information, and the two are kept
separate. Some Microsoft tools use the Symbol Table for limited but important
purposes, such as communicating COMDAT information to the linker. Section
names and file names, as well as code and data symbols, are listed in the
Symbol Table.
The location of the Symbol Table is indicated in the COFF Header.
The Symbol Table is an array of records, each 18 bytes long. Each record is
either a standard or auxiliary symbol-table record. A standard record defines
a symbol or name, and has the following format:
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         8              Name (*)  Name of the symbol, represented by union of
			 three structures. An array of eight bytes is used if
			 the name is not more than eight bytes long. See
			 Section 5.4.1, `Symbol Name Representation, ' for
			 more information.
8         4              Value     Value associated with the symbol. The
			 interpretation of this field depends on Section
			 Number and Storage Class. A typical meaning is the
			 relocatable address.
12        2              Section Number Signed integer identifying the
			 section, using a one-based index into the Section
			 Table. Some values have special meaning defined in
			 `Section Number Values.'
14        2              Type A number representing type. Microsoft tools set
			 this field to 0x20 (function) or 0x0 (not a
			 function). See Section 5.4.3, `Type Representation,'
			 for more information.
16        1              Storage Class  Enumerated value representing storage
			 class. See Section 5.4.4, `Storage Class,' for more
			 information.
17        1              Number of Aux Symbols    Number of auxiliary symbol
			 table entries that follow this record.
Zero or more auxiliary symbol-table records immediately follow each standard
symbol-table record. However, typically not more than one auxiliary
symbol-table record follows a standard symbol-table record (except for .file
records with long file names). Each auxiliary record is the same size as a
standard symbol-table record (18 bytes), but rather than define a new symbol,
the auxiliary record gives additional information on the last symbol defined.
The choice of which of several formats to use depends on the Storage Class
field. Currently-defined formats for auxiliary symbol table records are shown
in  `Auxiliary Symbol Records.'
Tools that read COFF symbol tables must ignore auxiliary symbol records whose
interpretation is unknown. This allows the symbol table format to be extended
to add new auxiliary records, without breaking existing tools.
5.4.1. Symbol Name Representation
The Name field in a symbol table consists of eight bytes that contain the name
itself, if not too long, or else give an offset into the String Table. To
determine whether the name itself or an offset is given, test the first four
bytes for equality to zero.
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         8              Short Name     An array of eight bytes. This array is
			 padded with nulls on the right if the name is less
			 than eight bytes long.
0         4              Zeroes    Set to all zeros if the name is longer than
			 eight bytes.
4         4              Offset    Offset into the String Table.

5.4.2. Section Number Values
Normally, the Section Value field in a symbol table entry is a one-based index
into the Section Table. However, this field is a signed integer and may take
negative values. The following values, less than one, have special meanings:
Constant            Value     Description

IMAGE_SYM_UNDEFINED 0         Symbol record is not yet assigned a section. In
			      object files, this setting is used for 
			      references to external symbols not defined by
			      the symbol record.
IMAGE_SYM_ABSOLUTE  -1        The symbol has a value but is not an address.
			      Examples are automatic variables and registers.
			      Not used by all Microsoft tools.
IMAGE_SYM_DEBUG     -2        The symbol provides general type or debugging
			      information but does not correspond to a
			      section. Microsoft tools use this setting along
			      with .file records (storage class FILE).

5.4.3. Type Representation
The Type field of a symbol table entry contains two bytes, each byte
representing type information. The least-significant byte represents simple
(base) data type, and the most-significant byte represents complex type, if
any:
MSB  LSB

Complex type: none, pointer, function, array.     Base type: integer,
floating-point, etc.
The following values are defined for base type, although Microsoft tools
generally do not use this field, setting the least-significant byte to 0.
Instead, CodeView information is used to indicate types. However, the possible
COFF values are listed here for completeness.
Constant            Value     Description

IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_NULL      0    No type information, or unknown base type.
			      Microsoft tools use this setting. 
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_VOID      1    No valid type; used with void pointers and
			      functions.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_CHAR      2    Character (signed byte).
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_SHORT     3    Two-byte signed integer.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_INT       4    Natural integer type (normally four bytes in
			      Windows NT).
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_LONG      5    Four-byte signed integer.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_FLOAT     6    Four-byte floating-point number.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_DOUBLE    7    Eight-byte floating-point number.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_STRUCT    8    Structure.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_UNION     9    Union.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_ENUM      10   Enumerated type.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_MOE       11   Member of enumeration (a specific value).
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_BYTE      12   Byte; unsigned one-byte integer.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_WORD      13   Word; unsigned two-byte integer.
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_UINT      14   Unsigned integer of natural size (normally, four
			      bytes).
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_DWORD     15   Unsigned four-byte integer.

The  most significant byte specifies whether the symbol is a pointer to,
function returning, or array of the base type specified in the least
significant byte. Microsoft tools use this field only to indicate whether or
not the symbol is a function, so that the only two resulting values are 0x0
and 0x20 for the Type field. However, other tools can use this field to
communicate more information.
Constant                 Value     Description

IMAGE_SYM_DTYPE_NULL     0         No derived type; the symbol is a simple
				   scalar variable. 
IMAGE_SYM_DTYPE_POINTER  1         Pointer to base type.
IMAGE_SYM_DTYPE_FUNCTION 2         Function returning base type.
IMAGE_SYM_DTYPE_ARRAY    3         Array of base type.

5.4.4. Storage Class
The Storage Class field of the Symbol Table indicates what kind of definition
a symbol represents. The following table shows possible values. Note that the
Storage Class field is an unsigned one-byte integer. The special value -1
should therefore be taken to mean its unsigned equivalent, 0xFF.
Although traditional COFF format makes use of many storage-class values,
Microsoft tools rely on CodeView format for most symbolic information and
generally use only four storage-class values: EXTERNAL (2), STATIC (3),
FUNCTION (101), and STATIC (103). Except in the second column heading below,
`Value' should be taken to mean the Value field of the symbol record (whose
interpretation depends on the number found as the storage class).

Constant                           Value     Description / Interpretation of
					     Value Field
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_END_OF_FUNCTION    -1 (0xFF) Special symbol representing end
					     of function, for debugging
					     purposes.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_NULL               0         No storage class assigned.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_AUTOMATIC          1         Automatic (stack) variable. The
					     Value field specifies stack frame
					     offset.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL           2         Used by Microsoft tools for
					     external symbols. The Value field
					     indicates the size if the section
					     number is IMAGE_SYM_UNDEFINED
					     (0). If the section number is not
					     0, then the Value field specifies
					     the offset within the section.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STATIC             3         The Value field specifies the
					     offset of the symbol within the
					     section. If the Value is 0, then
					     the symbol represents a section
					     name.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_REGISTER           4         Register variable. The Value
					     field specifies register number.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_EXTERNAL_DEF       5         Symbol is defined externally.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_LABEL              6         Code label defined within the
					     module. The Value field specifies
					     the offset of the symbol within
					     the section.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_UNDEFINED_LABEL    7         Reference to a code label not
					     defined.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_MEMBER_OF_STRUCT   8         Structure member. The Value field
					     specifies nth member.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_ARGUMENT           9         Formal argument (parameter)of a
					     function. The Value field
					     specifies nth argument.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STRUCT_TAG         10        Structure tag-name entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_MEMBER_OF_UNION    11        Union member. The Value field
					     specifies nth member.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_UNION_TAG          12        Union tag-name entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_TYPE_DEFINITION    13        Typedef entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_UNDEFINED_STATIC   14        Static data declaration.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_ENUM_TAG           15        Enumerated type tagname entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_MEMBER_OF_ENUM     16        Member of enumeration. Value
					     specifies nth member.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_REGISTER_PARAM     17        Register parameter.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_BIT_FIELD          18        Bit-field reference. Value speci-
					     fies nth bit in the bit field.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_BLOCK              100       A .bb (beginning of block) or .eb
					     (end of block) record. Value is
					     the relocatable address of the
					     code location.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_FUNCTION           101       Used by Microsoft tools for
					     symbol records that define the
					     extent of a function: begin
					     function (named .bf), end
					     function (.ef), and lines in
					     function (.lf). For .lf records,
					     Value gives the number of source
					     lines in the function. For .ef
					     records, Value gives the size of
					     function code.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_END_OF_STRUCT      102       End of structure entry.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_FILE               103       Used by Microsoft tools, as well
					     as traditional COFF format, for
					     the source-file symbol record.
					     The symbol is followed by an
					     auxiliary record that names the
					     file.
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_SECTION            104       Definition of a section (Mi-
					     crosoft tools use STATIC storage
					     class instead).
IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_WEAK_EXTERNAL      105       Weak external. Microsoft tools
					     use EXTERNAL storage class
					     instead. See Section 5.5.3,
					     `Auxiliary Format 3: Weak
					     Externals,' for more information.

 
5.5 Auxiliary Symbol Records
Auxiliary Symbol Table records always follow, and apply to, some standard
Symbol Table record. An auxiliary record can have any format that the tools
are designed to recognize, but 18 bytes must be allocated for them so that
Symbol Table is maintained as an array of regular size. Currently, Microsoft
tools recognize auxiliary formats for the following kinds of records: function
definitions, function begin and end symbols (.bf and .ef), weak externals,
filenames, and section definitions.
The traditional COFF design also includes auxiliary-record formats for arrays
and structures. Microsoft tools do not use these, instead placing that
symbolic information in CodeView format in the debug sections.
5.5.1. Auxiliary Format 1: Function Definitions
A symbol table record marks the beginning of a function defintion if all of
the following are true: it has storage class EXTERNAL (2), a Type value
indicating it is a function (0x20), and a section number greater than zero.
Note that a symbol table record that has a section number of UNDEFINED (0)
does not define the function and does not have an auxiliary record.
Function-definition symbol records are followed by an auxiliary record with
the format described below.
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         4              Tag Index Symbol-table index of the corresponding .bf
			 (begin function) symbol record.
4         4              Total Size     Size of the executable code for the
			 function itself. If the function is in its own
			 section, the Size of Raw Data in the section header
			 will be greater or equal to this field, depending on
			 alignment considerations.
8         4              Pointer to Linenumbers   File offset of the first
			 COFF line-number entry for the function, or zero if
			 none exists. See Section 5.3, `COFF Line Numbers,'
			 for more information.
12        4              Pointer to Next Function Symbol-table index of the
			 record for the next function. If the function is the
			 last in the symbol table, this field is set to zero.
16        2              Unused.

5.5.2. Auxiliary Format 2: .bf and .ef Symbols
For each function definition in the Symbol Table, there are three contiguous
items that describe the beginning, ending, and number of lines. Each of these
symbols has storage class FUNCTION (101):

   * A symbol record named .bf (begin function). The Value field is unused.
   * A symbol record named .lf (lines in function). The Value field gives the
     number of lines in the function.
   * A symbol record named .ef (end of function). The Value field has the same
     number as the Total Size field in the function-definition symbol record.

The .bf and .ef symbol records (but not .lf records) are followed by an
auxiliary record with the following format:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Unused.
4         2              Line Number    Actual ordinal line number (1, 2, 3,
			 etc.) within source file, corresponding to the .bf or
			 .ef record.
6         6              Unused.
12        4              Pointer to Next Function (.bf only)     Symbol-table
			 index of the next .bf symbol record. If the function
			 is the last in the symbol table, this field is set to
			 zero. Not used for .ef records.
16        2              Unused.

5.5.3. Auxiliary Format 3: Weak Externals
`Weak externals' are a mechanism for object files allowing flexibility at link
time. A module can contain an unresolved external symbol (sym1), but it can
also include an auxiliary record indicating that if sym1 is not present at
link time, another external symbol (sym2) is used to resolve references
instead.
If a definition of sym1 is linked, then an external reference to the symbol is
resolved normally. If a definition of sym1 is not linked, then all references
to the weak external for sym1 refer to sym2 instead. The external symbol,
sym2, must always be linked; typically it is defined in the module containing
the weak reference to sym1.
Weak externals are represented by a Symbol Table record with EXTERNAL storage
class, UNDEF section number, and a value of 0. The weak-external symbol record
is followed by an auxiliary record with the following format:

Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Tag Index Symbol-table index of sym2, the symbol to
			 be linked if sym1 is not found.
4         4              Characteristics     A value of 1 indicating that no
			 library search for sym1 should be performed, or a
			 value of 2 indicating that the linker should search
			 all libraries.
8         10             Unused.

Note that the Characteristics field is not defined in WINNT.H; instead, the
Total Size field is used.
5.5.4. Auxiliary Format 4: Files
This format follows a symbol-table record with storage class FILE (103). The
symbol name itself should be .file, and the auxiliary record that follows it
gives the name of a source-code file.
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         18             File Name ASCII string giving the name of the source
			 file; padded with nulls if less than maximum length.

5.5.5. Auxiliary Format 5: Section Definitions
This format follows a symbol-table record that defines a section: such a
record has a symbol name that is the name of a section (such as .text or
.drectve) and has storage class STATIC (3). The auxiliary record provides
information on the section referred to. Thus it duplicates some of the
information in the section header.
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Length    Size of section data; same as Size of Raw
			 Data in the section header.
4         2              Number Of Relocs    Number of relocation entries for
			 the section.
6         2              Number Of Linenumbers    Number of line-number
			 entries for the section.
8         4              Check Sum Checksum for communal data. Applicable if
			 the IMAGE_SCN_LNK_COMDAT flag is set in the section
			 header. See `COMDAT Sections' below, for more
			 information.
12        2              Number    One-based index into the Section Table for
			 the associated section; used when the COMDAT
			 Selection setting is 5.
14        1              Selection COMDAT selection number. Applicable if the
			 section is a COMDAT section.
15        3              Unused.

5.5.6. COMDAT Sections (Object Only)
The Selection field of the Section Definition auxiliary format is applicable
if the section is a COMDAT section: a section that can be defined by more than
one object file. (The flag IMAGE_SCN_LNK_COMDAT is set in the Section Flags
field of the section header.) The way that the linker resolves the multiple
definitions of COMDAT sections is determined by the Selection field.
The first symbol having the section value of the COMDAT section is the section
symbol This symbol has the name of the section, Value field equal to 0, the
section number of the COMDAT section in question, Type field equal to
IMAGE_SYM_TYPE_NULL, Class field equal to IMAGE_SYM_CLASS_STATIC, and one
auxiliary record. The second symbol is called `the COMDAT symbol' and is used
by the linker in conjunction with the Selection field.
Values for the Selection field are shown below.
Constant                           Value     Description
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_NODUPLICATES   1         The linker generates a warning if
					     more than one section defines the
					     same COMDAT symbol, but links in
					     one of the sections anyway.
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_ANY            2         Any section defining the same
					     COMDAT symbol may be linked; the
					     rest are removed.
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_SAME_SIZE      3         The linker chooses an arbitrary
					     section among the duplicate sec-
					     tions (having same COMDAT
					     symbol); however, all must be the
					     same size or the linker generates
					     a warning.
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_EXACT_MATCH    4         All duplicate sections must match
					     exactly. One of them is linked.
					     (This is not currently
					     implemented in the linker).
IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_ASSOCIATIVE    5         The section is linked if a
					     certain other COMDAT section is
					     linked. This other section is
					     indicated by the Number field of
					     the auxiliary symbol record for
					     the section definition. Use of
					     this setting is useful for
					     definitions that have components
					     in multiple sections (for
					     example, code in one and data in
					     another), but where all must be
					     linked together.

 
5.6 COFF String Table
Immediately following the COFF symbol table is the COFF string table. The
position of this table is found by taking the symbol table address in the COFF
header, and adding the number of symbols multiplied by the size of a symbol.
At the beginning of the COFF string table are 4 bytes containing the total
size (in bytes) of the rest of the string table.  This size does not include
the Size field itself, so that the value in this location would be 0 if no
strings were present.
Following the size are null-terminated strings pointed to by symbols in the
COFF symbol table.

 
6. Special Sections
Typical COFF sections contain code or data that linkers and Win32 loaders
process without special knowledge of the sections' contents. The contents are
relevant only to the application being linked or executed.
However, some COFF sections have special meanings when found in object files
and/or image files. Tools and loaders recognize these sections because they
have special flags set in the section header, or because they are pointed to
from special locations in the image optional header, or because the section
name is `magic': that is, the name indicates a special function of the
section. (Even where the section name is not magic, the name is dictated by
convention, so we will refer to a name.)
Some of the sections listed here are marked `(object only)' or `(image only)'
to indicate that their special semantics are relevant only for object files or
image files, respectively. A section that says `(image only)' may still appear
in an object file as a way of getting into the image file, but the section has
no special meaning to the linker, only to the image file loader.

 
6.1 The .debug Section
The .debug section is used in object files to contain compiler-generated debug
information, and in image files to contain the total debug information
generated. This section describes the packaging of debug information in object
and image files. The actual format of CodeView debug information is not
described here. See the document CV4 Symbolic Debug Information Specification.
The next section describes the format of the debug directory, which can be
anywhere in the image. Subsequent sections describe the `groups' in object
files that contain debug information.
6.1.1. Debug Directory (Image Only)
Image files contain an optional `debug directory' indicating what form of
debug information is present and where it is. This directory consists of an
array of `debug directory entries' whose location and size are indicated in
the image optional header.
The debug directory may be in a discardable .debug section (if one exists) or
it may be included in any other section in the image file, or not in a section
at all.
Each debug directory entry identifies the location and size of a block of
debug information. The RVA specified may be 0 if the debug information is not
covered by a section header (i.e., it resides in the image file and is not
mapped into the run-time address space). If it is mapped, the RVA is its
address.
Here is the format of a debug directory entry:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Characteristics     A reserved field intended to be
			 used for flags, set to zero for now.
4         4              Time/Date Stamp     Time and date the debug data was
			 created.
8         2              Major Version  Major version number of the debug data
			 format.
10        2              Minor Version  Minor version number of the debug data
			 format.
12        4              Debug Type     Format of debugging information: this
			 field enables support of multiple debuggers. See
			 Section 6.1.2, `Debug Type,' for more information.
16        4              Size of Data   Size of the debug data (not including
			 the debug directory itself).
20        4              RVA of Raw Data     Address of the debug data when
			 loaded, relative to the image base.
24        4              Pointer to Raw Data File pointer to the debug data.

6.1.2. Debug Type
The following values are defined for the Debug Type field of the debug
directory:
Constant                 Value     Description

IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_UNKOWN       0    Unknown value, ignored by all tools.
IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_COFF         1    COFF debug information (line numbers,
				   symbol table, and string table). This type
				   of debug information is also pointed to by
				   fields in the file headers.
IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_CODEVIEW     2    CodeView debug information. The format of
				   the data block is described by the CV4
				   specification.
IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_FPO          3    Frame Pointer Omission (FPO) information.
				   This information tells the debugger how to
				   interpret non-standard stack frames, which
				   use the EBP register for a purpose other
				   than as a frame pointer.

If Debug Type is set to IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_FPO, the debug raw data is an array
in which each member describes the stack frame of a function. Not every
function in the image file need have FPO information defined for it, even
though debug type is FPO. Those functions that do not have FPO information are
assumed to have normal stack frames. The format for FPO information is defined
as follows:
 
#define FRAME_FPO   0
#define FRAME_TRAP  1
#define FRAME_TSS   2

typedef struct _FPO_DATA {
    DWORD       ulOffStart;            // offset 1st byte of function code
    DWORD       cbProcSize;            // # bytes in function
    DWORD       cdwLocals;             // # bytes in locals/4
    WORD        cdwParams;             // # bytes in params/4

    WORD        cbProlog : 8;          // # bytes in prolog
    WORD        cbRegs   : 3;          // # regs saved
    WORD        fHasSEH  : 1;          // TRUE if SEH in func
    WORD        fUseBP   : 1;          // TRUE if EBP has been allocated
    WORD        reserved : 1;          // reserved for future use
    WORD        cbFrame  : 2;          // frame type
} FPO_DATA;

6.1.3. .debug$F (Object Only)
Object files can contain .debug$F sections whose contents are one or more
FPO_DATA 
records (Frame Pointer Omission information). See `IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_FPO' in
table above.
The linker recognizes these .debug$F records. If debug information is being
generated, the linker sorts the FPO_DATA records by procedure RVA, and
generates a debug directory entry for them.
The compiler should not generate FPO records for procedures that have a
standard frame format.
6.1.4. .debug$S (Object Only)
This section contains CV4 symbolic information: a stream of CV4 symbol records
as described in the CV4 spec.
6.1.5. .debug$T (Object Only)
This section contains CV4 type information: a stream of CV4 type records as
described in the CV4 spec.
6.1.6. Linker Support for Microsoft CodeView Debug Information
To support CodeView debug information, the linker:
   * Generates the header and `NB05' signature.
   * Packages the header with .debug$S and .debug$T sections from object files
     and synthetic (linker-generated) CV4 information, and creates a debug
     directory entry.
   * Generates the subsection directory containing a pointer to each known
     subsection, including subsections that are linker-generated.
   * Generates the sstModules subsection, which specifies the address and size
     of each module's contribution(s) to the image address space.
   * Generates the sstSegMap subsection, which specifies the address and size
     of each section in the image.
   * Generates the sstPublicSym subsection, which contains the name and
     address of all externally defined symbols. (A symbol may be represented
     both by .debug$S information and by an sstPublicSym entry.)

 
6.2 The .drecve Sections (Object Only)
A section is a `directive' section if it has the IMAGE_SCN_LNK_INFO flag set
in the section header. By convention, such a section also has the name
.drectve. The linker removes a .drectve section after processing the
information, so the section does not appear in the image file being linked.
Note that a section marked with IMAGE_SCN_LNK_INFO that is not named .drectve
is ignored and discarded by the linker.
A .drectve section consists of a string of ASCII text. This string is a series
of linker options (each option containing hyphen, option name, and any
appropriate attribute) separated by spaces. The .drectve section must not have
relocations or line numbers.
In a .drectve section, if the hyphen preceding an option is followed by a
question mark (for example, `-?export'), and the option is not recognized as a
valid directive, the linker must ignore it. This allows compilers and linkers
to add new directives while maintaining compatibility with existing linkers,
as long as the new directives are not required for the correct linking of the
application. For example, if the directive enables a link-time optimization,
it is acceptable if some linkers cannot recognize it.

 
6.3 The .edata Section (Image Only)
The export data section, named .edata, contains information about symbols that
other images can access through dynamic linking. Exports are generally found
in DLLs, but DLLs can import symbols as well.
An overview of the general structure of the export section is described below.
The tables described are generally contiguous in the file and present in the
order shown (though this is not strictly required). Only the Directory Table
and Address Table are necessary for exporting symbols as ordinals. (An ordinal
is an export accessed directly as an Export Address Table index.) The Name
Pointer Table, Ordinal Table, and Export Name Table all exist to support use
of export names.

Table Name               Description
Export Directory Table   A table with just one row (unlike the debug direc-
			 tory). This table indicates the locations and sizes
			 of the other export tables.
Export Address Table     An array of RVAs of exported symbols. These are the
			 actual addresses of the exported functions and data
			 within the executable code and data sections. Other
			 image files can import a symbol by using an index to
			 this table (an ordinal) or, optionally, by using the
			 public name that corresponds to the ordinal if one is
			 defined.
Name Pointer Table       Array of pointers to the public export names, sorted
			 in ascending order.
Ordinal Table            Array of the ordinals that correspond to members of
			 the Name Pointer Table. The correspondence is by
			 position; therefore, the Name Pointer Table and the
			 Ordinal Table must have the same number of members.
			 Each ordinal is an index into the Export Address
			 Table.
Export Name Table        A series of null-terminated ASCII strings. Members of
			 the Name Pointer Table point into this area. These
			 names are the public names through which the symbols
			 are imported and exported; they do not necessarily
			 have to be the same as the private names used within
			 the image file.
When another image file imports a symbol by name, the Name Pointer Table is
searched for a matching string. If one is found, the associated ordinal is
then determined by looking at the corresponding member in the Ordinal Table
(that is, the member of the Ordinal Table with the same index as the string
pointer found in the Name Pointer Table). The resulting ordinal is an index
into the Export Address Table, which gives the actual location of the desired
symbol. Every export symbol can be accessed by an ordinal.
Direct use of an ordinal is therefore more efficient, because it avoids the
need to search the Name Pointer Table for a matching string. However, use of
an export name is more mnemonic and does not require the user to know the
table index for the symbol.

6.3.1. Export Directory Table
The export information begins with the Export Directory Table, which describes
the remainder of the export information. The Export Directory Table contains
address information that is used to resolve fix-up references to the entry
points within this image.

Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Export Flags   A reserved field, set to zero for now.
4         4              Time/Date Stamp     Time and date the export data was
			 created.
8         2              Major Version  Major version number. The major/minor
			 version number can be set by the user.
10        2              Minor Version  Minor version number.
12        4              Name RVA  Address of the ASCII string containing the
			 name of the DLL. Relative to image base.
16        4              Ordinal Base   Starting ordinal number for exports in
			 this image. This field specifies the starting ordinal
			 number for the Export Address Table. Usually set to
			 1.
20        4              Address Table Entries    Number of entries in the
			 Export Address Table.
24        4              Number of Name Pointers  Number of entries in the
			 Name Pointer Table (also the number of entries in the
			 Ordinal Table).
28        4              Export Address Table RVA Address of the Export
			 Address Table, relative to the image base.
32        4              Name Pointer RVA    Address of the Export Name
			 Pointer Table, relative to the image base. The table
			 size is given by Number of Name Pointers.
36        4              Ordinal Table RVA   Address of the Ordinal Table,
			 relative to the image base.

6.3.2. Export Address Table
The Export Address Table contains the address of exported entry points and
exported data and absolutes. An ordinal number is used to index the Export
Address Table, after subtracting the value of the Ordinal Base field to get a
true, zero-based index. (Thus, if the Ordinal Base is set to 1, a common
value, an ordinal of 6 is the same as a zero-based index of 5.)
Each entry in the Export Address Table is a field that uses one of two
formats, as shown in the following table. If the address specified is not
within the export section (as defined by the address and length indicated in
the Optional Header), the field is an Export RVA: an actual address in code or
data. Otherwise, the field is a Forwarder RVA, which names a symbol in another
DLL.
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Export RVA     Address of the exported symbol when
			 loaded into memory, relative to the image base. For
			 example, the address of an exported function.
0         4              Forwarder RVA  Pointer to a null-terminated ASCII
			 string in the export section, giving the DLL name and
			 the name of the export (for example,
			 `MYDLL..expfunc') or the DLL name and an export (for
			 example, `MYDLL.#27').
A Forwarder RVA exports a definition from some other image, making it appear
as if it were being exported by the current image. Thus the symbol is
simultaneously imported and exported.
For example, in KERNEL32.DLL in Windows NT, the export named `HeapAlloc' is
forwarded to the string `NTDLL.RtlAllocateHeap'. This allows applications to
use the NT-specific module `NTDLL.DLL' without actually containing import
references to it. The application's import table references only
`KERNEL32.DLL.' Therefore, the application is not specific to Windows NT and
can run on any Win32 system.
6.3.3. Export Name Pointer Table
The Export Name Pointer Table is an array of addresses (RVAs) into the Export
Name Table. The pointers are 32 bits each and are relative to the Image Base.
The pointers are ordered lexically to allow binary searches.
An export name is defined only if the Export Name Pointer Table contains a
pointer to it.

6.3.4. Export Ordinal Table
The Export Ordinal Table is an array of 16-bit indexes into the Export Address
Table. The ordinals are biased by the Ordinal Base field of the Export
Directory Table. In other words, the Ordinal Base must be subtracted from the
ordinals to obtain true indexes into the Export Address Table.
The Export Name Pointer Table and the Export Ordinal Table form two parallel
arrays, separated to allow natural field alignment. These two tables, in
effect, operate as one table, in which the Export Name Pointer `column' points
to a public (exported) name, and the Export Ordinal `column' gives the
corresponding ordinal for that public name. A member of the Export Name
Pointer Table and a member of the Export Ordinal Table are associated by
having the same position (index) in their respective arrays.
Thus, when the Export Name Pointer Table is searched and a matching string is
found at position i, the algorithm for finding the symbol's address is:
 
i = Search_ExportNamePointerTable (ExportName);
ordinal = ExportOrdinalTable [i];
SymbolRVA = ExportAddressTable [ordinal - OrdinalBase];

6.3.5. Export Name Table
The Export Name Table contains the actual string data pointed to by the Export
Name Pointer Table. The strings in this table are public names that can be
used by other images to import the symbols; these public export names are not
necessarily the same as the (private) symbol names that the symbols have in
their own image file and source code, although they can be.
Every exported symbol has an ordinal value, which is just the index into the
Export Address Table (plus the Ordinal Base value). Use of export names,
however, is optional. Some, all, or none of the exported symbols can have
export names. For those exported symbols that do have export names,
corresponding entries in the Export Name Pointer Table and Export Ordinal
Table work together to associate each name with an ordinal.
The structure of the Export Name Table is a series of ASCII strings, of
variable length, each null terminated.

 
6.3 The .idata Section (Image Only)

All image files that import symbols, including virtually all .EXE files, have
an .idata section. A typical file layout for the import information follows:

6.4.1. Import Directory Table
The import information begins with the Import Directory Table, which describes
the remainder of the import information. The Import Directory Table contains
address information that is used to resolve fix-up references to the entry
points within a DLL image. The Import Directory Table consists of an array of
Import Directory Entries, one entry for each DLL the image references. The
last directory entry is empty (filled with null values), which indicates the
end of the directory table.
Each Import Directory entry has the following format:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Import Lookup Table RVA (Characteristics)    Relative
			 virtual address of the Import Lookup Table; this
			 table contains a name or ordinal for each import.
			 (The name `Characteristics' is used in WINNT.H but is
			 no longer descriptive of this field.)
4         4              Time/Date Stamp     Set to zero until bound; then
			 this field is set to the time/data stamp of the DLL.
8         4              Fowarder Chain Index of first forwarder reference.
12        4              Name RVA  Address of  ASCII string containing the DLL
			 name. This address is relative to the image base.
16        4              Import Address Table RVA (Thunk Table)  Relative vir-
			 tual address of the Import Address Table: this table
			 is identical in contents to the Import Lookup Table
			 until the image is bound.
6.4.2. Import Lookup Table
An Import Lookup Table is an array of 32-bit numbers, each using the bit-field
format described below, in which bit 31 is the most significant bit. The
collection of these entries describes all imports from the image to a given
DLL. The last entry is set to zero (NULL) to indicate end of the table.
Bit(s)    Size Bit Field Description
31        1              Ordinal/Name Flag   If bit is set, import by ordinal.
			 Otherwise, import by name. Bit is masked as
			 0x80000000.
30 - 0    31             Ordinal Number Ordinal/Name Flag is 1: import by
			 ordinal. This field is a 31-bit ordinal number .
30 - 0    31             Hint/Name Table RVA Ordinal/Name Flag is 0: import by
			 name. This field is a 31-bit address of a Hint/Name
			 Table entry, relative to image base.

The lower 31 bits can be masked as 0x7FFFFFFF. In either case, the resulting
number is a 32-bit integer or pointer in which the high bit is always zero
(zero extension to 32 bits).

6.4.3. Hint/Name Table
One Hint/Name Table suffices for the entire import section. Each entry in the
Hint/Name Table has the following format:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Hint Index into the Export Name Pointer Table. A
			 match is attempted first with this value. If it
			 fails, a binary search is performed on the DLL's
			 Export Name Pointer Table.
4         variable       Name ASCII string containing name to import. This is
			 the string that must be matched to the public name in
			 the DLL. This string is case sensitive and terminated
			 by a null byte.
*         0 or 1         Pad  A trailing zero pad byte appears after the trai-
			 ling null byte, if necessary, to align the next entry
			 on an even boundary.
6.4.4. Import Address Table
The structure and content of the Import Address Table are identifical to that
of the Import Lookup Table, until the file is bound. During binding, the
entries in the Import Address Table are overwritten with the 32-bit addresses
of the symbols being imported: these addresses are the actual memory addresses
of the symbols themselves (although technically, they are still called
`virtual addresses'). The processing of binding is typically performed by the
loader.

 
6.5 The .reloc Section (Image Only)
The Fix-Up Table contains entries for all fixups in the image. The Total
Fix-Up Data Size in the Optional Header is the number of bytes in the fixup
table. The fixup table is broken into blocks of fixups. Each block represents
the fixups for a 4K page. Each block must start on a 32-bit boundary.
Fixups that are resolved by the linker do not need to be processed by the
loader, unless the load image can't be loaded at the Image Base specified in
the PE Header.
6.5.1. Fixup Block
Each fixup block starts with the following structure:
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         4              Page RVA  The image base plus the page RVA is added
			 to each offset to create the virtual address of where
			 the fixup needs to be applied.
4         4              Block Size     Total number of bytes in the fixup
			 block, including the Page RVA and Block Size fields,
			 as well as the Type/Offset fields that follow.

The Block Size field is then followed by any number of Type/Offset entries.
Each entry is a word (2 bytes) and has the following structure:
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         4 bits         Type Stored in high 4 bits of word. Value indicating
			 which type of fixup is to be applied. These fixups
			 are described in `Fixup Types.'
0         12 bits        Offset    Stored in remaining 12 bits of word. Offset
			 from starting address specified in the Page RVA field
			 for the block. This offset specifies where the fixup
			 is to be applied.
To apply a fixup, a delta is calculated as the difference between the
preferred base address, and the base where the image is actually loaded. If
the image is loaded at its preferred base, the delta would be zero, and thus
the fixups would not have to be applied.
6.5.2. Fixup Types
Constant                      Value     Description

IMAGE_REL_BASED_ABSOLUTE      0         The fixup is skipped. This type can be
					used to pad a block.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGH          1         The fixup adds the high 16 bits of the
					delta to the 16-bit field at Offset.
					The 16-bit field represents the high
					value of a 32-bit word.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_LOW           2         The fixup adds the low 16 bits of the
					delta to the 16-bit field at Offset.
					The 16-bit field represents the low
					half of a 32-bit word. This fixup is
					emitted for a RISC machine only when
					the image Object Align value is not
					the default of 64K.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW       3         The fixup applies the 32-bit delta to
					the 32-bit field at Offset. The high
					16 bits are located at Offset, and the
					low 16 bits are located in the next
					Offset record. The two need to be
					combined into a signed variable.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHADJ       4         This fixup requires a full 32-bit
					value.
IMAGE_REL_BASED_MIPS_JMPADDR  5         Fixup applies to a MIPS jump instruc-
					tion.

 
6.6 The .tls Section
The .tls section provides direct PE/COFF support for static Thread Local
Storage (TLS). TLS is a special storage class supported by Windows NT, in
which a data object is not an automatic (stack) variable, yet it is local to
each individual thread that runs the code. Thus, each thread can maintain a
different value for a variable declared using TLS.
Note that any amount of TLS data can be supported by using the API calls
TlsAlloc, TlsFree, TlsSetValue, and TlsGetValue. The PE/COFF implementation is
an alternative approach to using the API, and it has the advantage of being
simpler from the high-level-language programmer's point of view. This
implementation enables TLS data to be defined and initialized in a manner
similar to ordinary static variables in a program. For example, in Microsoft
Visual C++, a static TLS variable can be defined as follows, without using the
Windows API:
 
__declspec (thread) int tlsFlag = 1;

To support this programming construct, the PE/COFF .tls section specifies the
following information: initialization data, callback routines for per-thread
initialization and termination, and the TLS index, explained in the following
discussion.
 

Note     Statically declared TLS data objects can be used only in statically
loaded image files. This fact makes it unreliable to use static TLS data in a
DLL unless you know that the DLL, or anything statically linked with it, will
never be loaded dynamically with the LoadLibrary API function.

Executable code accesses a static TLS data object through the following steps:
1.   At link time, the linker sets the Address of Index field of the TLS
Directory. This field points to a location where the program will expect to
receive the TLS index. 
     The Microsoft run-time library facilitates this process by defining a
memory image of the TLS Directory and giving it the special name `__tls_used'
(Intel x86 platforms) or `_tls_used' (other platforms). The linker looks for
this memory image and uses the data there to create the TLS Directory. Other
compilers that support TLS and work with the Microsoft linker must use this
same technique.
2.   When a thread is created, the loader communicates the address of the
thread's TLS array by placing the address of the Thread Environment Block
(TEB) in the FS register. A pointer to the TLS array is at the offset of 0x2C
from the beginning of TEB. This behavior is Intel x86 specific.
3.   The loader assigns the value of the TLS index to the place indicated by
the Address of Index field.
4.   The executable code retrieves the TLS index and also the location of the
TLS array.
5.   The code uses the TLS index and the TLS array location (multiplying the
index by four and using it as an offset to the array) to get the address of
the TLS data area for the given program and module. Each thread has its own
TLS data area, but this is transparent to the program, which doesn't need to
know how data is allocated for individual threads.
6.   An individual TLS data object is accessed as some fixed offset into the
TLS data area.
The TLS array is an array of addresses that the system maintains for each
thread. Each address in this array gives the location of TLS data for a given
module (.EXE or DLL) within the program. The TLS index indicates which member
of the array to use. (The index is a number, meaningful only to the system,
that identifies the module).
6.6.1. The TLS Directory
The TLS Directory has the following format:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Raw Data Start VA (Virtual Address)     Starting ad-
			 dress of the TLS template. The template is a block of
			 data used to initialize TLS data. The system copies
			 all this data each time a thread is created, so it
			 must not be corrupted. Note that this address is not
			 an RVA; it is an address for which there should be a
			 base relocation in the .reloc section.
4         4              Raw Data End VA     Address of the last byte of the
			 TLS, except for the zero fill. As with the Raw Data
			 Start VA, this is a virtual address, not an RVA.
8         4              Address of Index    Location to receive the TLS
			 index, which the loader assigns. This location is in
			 an ordinary data section, so it can be given a
			 symbolic name accessible to the program.
12        4              Address of Callbacks     Pointer to an array of TLS
			 callback functions. The array is null-terminated, so
			 if there is no callback function supported, this
			 field points to four bytes set to zero. The prototype
			 for these functions is given below, in `TLS Callback
			 Functions.'
16        4              Size of Zero Fill   The size in bytes of the tem-
			 plate, beyond the initialized data delimited by Raw
			 Data Start VA and Raw Data End VA. The total template
			 size should be the same as the total size of TLS data
			 in the image file. The zero fill is the amount of
			 data that comes after the initialized nonzero data.
20        4              Characteristics     Reserved for possible future use
			 by TLS flags.

6.6.2. TLS Callback Functions
The program can provide one or more TLS callback functions (though Microsoft
compilers do not currently use this feature) to support additional
initialization and termination for TLS data objects. A typical reason to use
such a callback function would be to call constructors and destructors for
objects.
Although there is typically no more than one callback function, a callback is
implemented as an array to make it possible to add additional callback
functions if desired. If there is more than one callback function, each
function is called in the order its address appears in the array. A null
pointer terminates the array. It is perfectly valid to have an empty list (no
callback supported), in which case the callback array has exactly one member—a
null pointer.
The prototype for a callback function (pointed to by a pointer of type
PIMAGE_TLS_CALLBACK) has the same parameters as a DLL entry-point function:
 
typedef VOID
(NTAPI *PIMAGE_TLS_CALLBACK) (
    PVOID DllHandle,
    DWORD Reason,
    PVOID Reserved
    );

The Reserved parameter should be left set to 0. The Reason parameter can take
the following values:
Setting             Value     Description

DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH  1         New process has started, including the first
			      thread.
DLL_THREAD_ATTACH   2         New thread has been created (this notification
			      sent for all but the first thread).
DLL_THREAD_DETACH   3         Thread is about to be terminated (this notifica-
			      tion sent for all but the first thread).
DLL_PROCESS_DETACH  0         Process is about to terminate, including the
			      original thread.

 
6.7 The .rsrc Section
Resources are indexed by a multiple level binary-sorted tree structure. The
general design can incorporate 2**31 levels. By convention, however, Windows
NT uses three levels:
   * Type
   * Name
   * Language
A series of Resource Directory Tables relate all the levels in the following
way: each directory table is followed by a series of directory entries, which
give the name or ID for that level (Type, Name, or Language level) and an
address of either a data description or another directory table. If a data
description is pointed to, then the data is a leaf in the tree. If another
directory table is pointed to, then that table lists directory entries at the
next level down.
A leaf's Type, Name, and Language IDs are determined by the path taken,
through directory tables, to reach the leaf. The first table determines Type
ID, the second table (pointed to by the directory entry in the first table)
determines Name ID, and the third table determines Language ID.
The general structure of the .rsrc section is:
Data                          Description

Resource Directory Tables 
(and Resource Directory 
Entries)                      A series of tables, one for each  group of nodes
			      in the tree. All top-level (Type) nodes are
			      listed in the first table. Entries in this table
			      point to second-level tables. Each second-level
			      tree has the same Type identifier but different
			      Name identifiers. Third-level trees have the
			      same Type and Name identifiers but different
			      Language identifiers.Each individual table is
			      immediately followed by directory entries, in
			      which each entry has: 1) a name or numeric
			      identifier, and 2) a pointer to a data
			      description or a table at the next lower level.
Resource Directory Strings    Two-byte-aligned Unicode strings, which serve as
			      string data pointed to by directory entries.
Resource Data Description     An array of records, pointed to by tables, which
			      describe the actual size and location of the
			      resource data. These records are the leaves in
			      the resource-description tree.
Resource Data                 Raw data of the resource section. The size and
			      location information in the Resource Data
			      Descriptions delimit the individual regions of
			      resource data.
6.7.1. Resource Directory Table
Each Resource Directory Table has the following format. This data structure
should be considered the heading of a table, because the table actually
consists of directory entries (see next section) as well as this structure:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Characteristics     Resource flags, reserved for
			 future use; currently set to zero.
4         4              Time/Date Stamp     Time the resource data was
			 created by the resource compiler.
8         2              Major Version  Major version number, set by the user.
10        2              Minor Version  Minor version number.
12        2              Number of Name Entries   Number of directory entries,
			 immediately following the table, that use strings to
			 identify Type, Name, or Language (depending on the
			 level of the table).
14        2              Number of ID Entries     Number of directory entries,
			 immediately following the Name entries, that use
			 numeric identifiers for Type, Name, or Language.
6.7.2. Resource Directory Entries
The directory entries make up the rows of a table. Each Resource Directory
Entry has the following format. Note that whether the entry is a Name or ID
entry is indicated by the Resource Directory Table, which indicates how many
Name and ID entries follow it (remember that all the Name entries precede all
the ID entries for the table). All entries for the table are sorted in
ascending order: the Name entries by case-insensitive string, and the ID
entries by numeric value.
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Name RVA  Address of string that gives the Type,
			 Name, or Language identifier, depending on level of
			 table.
0         4              Integer ID     32-bit integer that identifies Type,
			 Name, or Language.
4         4              Data Entry RVA High bit 0. Address of a Resource Data
			 Entry (a leaf).
4         4              Subdirectory RVA    High bit 1. Lower 31 bits are the
			 address of another Resource Directory Table (the next
			 level down).
6.7.3. Resource Directory String
The Resource Directory String area consists of Unicode strings, which are word
aligned. These strings are stored together after the last Resource Directory
Entry and before the first Resource Data Entry. This minimizes the impact of
these variable length strings on the alignment of the fixed-size directory
entries. Each Resource Directory String has the following format:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         2              Length    Size of string, not including length field
			 itself.
2         variable       Unicode String Variable-length Unicode string data,
			 word aligned.
6.7.4. Resource Data Entry
Each Resource Data Entry describes an actual unit of raw data in the Resource
Data area, and has the following format:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Data RVA  Address of a unit of resource data in the
			 Resource Data area.
4         4              Size Size, in bytes, of the resource data pointed to
			 by the Data RVA field.
8         4              Codepage  Code page used to decode code point values
			 within the resource data. Typically, the code page
			 would be the Unicode code page.
12        4              Reserved (must be set to 0)
6.7.5. Resource Example
The resource example shows the PE/COFF representation of the following
resource data:
 
TypeId#        NameId#        Language ID     Resource Data
     1              1              0              00010001
     1              1              1              10010001
     1              2              0              00010002
     1              3              0              00010003
     2              1              0              00020001
     2              2              0              00020002
     2              3              0              00020003
     2              4              0              00020004
     9              1              0              00090001
     9              9              0              00090009
     9              9              1              10090009
     9              9              2              20090009

When this data is encoded, a dump of the PE/COFF Resource Directory results in

the following output:

8. Archive (Library) File Format

The COFF archive format provides a standard mechanism for stroring collections
of object files. These collections are frequently referred to as "libraries"
in programming documentation.
The first eight bytes of an archive consist of the file signature. The rest of
the archive consists of a series of archive members, as follows:
   * The first and second members are "linker members." Each has of these
     members has its own format as described in Section 8.3. Typically, a
     linker places information into these archive members. The linker members
     contain the directory of the archive.
   * The third member is the longnames member. This member consists of a
     series of null-terminated ASCII strings, in which each string is the name
     of another archive member.
   * The rest of the archive consists of standard (object-file) members. Each
     of these members contains the contents of one object file in its
     entirety.
An archive member header precedes each member. The following illustration
shows the general structure of an archive:

Figure 4. Archive File Structure
 
8.1 Archive File Signature
The archive file signature identifies the file type. Any utility (for example,
a linker) expecting an archive file as input can check the file type by
reading this signature. The signature consists of the following ASCII
characters, in which each character below is represented literally, except for
the newline (\n) character:
 
!<arch>\n


 
8.2 Archive Member Headers
Each member (linker, longnames, or object-file member) is preceded by a
header. An archive member header has the following format, in which each field
is an ASCII text string that is left-justified and padded with spaces to the
end of the field. There is no terminating null character in any of these
fields.
Each member header starts on the first even address after the end of the
previous archive member.
Offset    Size Field     Description

0         16             Name Name of archive member, with a slash (/)
			 appended to terminate the name. If the first cha-
			 racter is a slash, the name has a special inter-
			 pretation, as described below.
16        12             Date Date and time the archive member was created:
			 ASCII decimal representation of the number of seconds
			 since 1/1/1970 UCT.
28        6              User ID   ASCII decimal representation of the user
			 ID.
34        6              Group ID  ASCII group representation of the group ID.
40        8              Mode ASCII octal representation of the member's file
			 mode.
48        10             Size ASCII decimal representation of the total size
			 of the archive member, not including the size of the
			 header.
58        2              End of Header  The two bytes in the C string "`\n".
The Name field has one of the formats shown in the following table. As
mentioned above, each of these strings is left justified and padded with
trailing spaces within a field of 16 bytes:
Contents of Name Field   Description
name/                    The field gives the name of the archive member
			 directly.
/                        The archive member is one of the two linker members.
			 Both of the linker members have this name.
//                       The archive member is the longname member, which con-
			 sists of a series of null-terminated ASCII strings.
			 The longnames member is the third archive member, and
			 must always be present even if the contents are
			 empty.
/n                       The name of the archive member is located at offset n
			 within the longnames member. The number n is the
			 decimal representation of the offset. For example:
			 "\26" indicates that the name of the archive member
			 is located 26 bytes beyond the beginning of longnames
			 member contents.

 
8.3 First Link Member
The name of the first linker member is "\". The first linker member, which is
included for backward compatibility, is not used by current linkers but its
format must be correct. This linker member provides a directory of symbol
names, as does the second linker member. For each symbol, the information
indicates where to find the archive member that contains the symbol.
The first linker member has the following format. This information appears
after the header:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Number of Symbols   Unsigned long containing the
			 number of symbols indexed. This number is stored in
			 big-endian format. Each object-file member typically
			 defines one or more external symbols.
4         4 * n          Offsets   Array of file offsets to archive member
			 headers, in which n is equal to Number of Symbols.
			 Each number in the array is an unsigned long stored
			 in big-endian format. For each symbol named in the
			 String Table, the corresponding element in the
			 Offsets array gives the location of the archive mem-
			 ber that contains the symbol.
*         *              String Table   Series of null-terminated strings that
			 name all the symbols in the directory. Each string
			 begins immediately after the null character in the
			 previous string. The number of strings must be equal
			 to the value of the Number of Symbols fields.
The elements in the Offsets array must be arranged in ascending order. This
fact implies that the symbols listed in the String Table must be arranged
according to the order of archive members. For example, all the symbols in the
first object-file member would have to be listed before the symbols in the
second object file.

 
8.4 Second Linker Member
The name of the first linker member is "\". The first linker member, which is
included for backward compatibility, is not used by current linkers but its
format must be correct. This linker member provides a directory of symbol
names, as does the second linker member. For each symbol, the information
indicates where to find the archive member that contains the symbol.
The first linker member has the following format. This information appears
after the header:
Offset    Size Field     Description
0         4              Number of Symbols   Unsigned long containing the
			 number of symbols indexed. This number is stored in
			 big-endian format. Each object-file member typically
			 defines one or more external symbols.
4         4 * n          Offsets   Array of file offsets to archive member
			 headers, in which n is equal to Number of Symbols.
			 Each number in the array is an unsigned long stored
			 in big-endian format. For each symbol named in the
			 String Table, the corresponding element in the
			 Offsets array gives the location of the archive mem-
			 ber that contains the symbol.
*         *              String Table   Series of null-terminated strings that
			 name all the symbols in the directory. Each string
			 begins immediately after the null character in the
			 previous string. The number of strings must be equal
			 to the value of the Number of Symbols fields.
The elements in the Offsets array must be arranged in ascending order. This
fact implies that the symbols listed in the String Table must be arranged
according to the order of archive members. For example, all the symbols in the
first object-file member would have to be listed before the symbols in the
second object file.

 
8.5 Longnames Member
The name of the longnames member is "\\". The longnames member is a series of
strings of archive member names. A name appears here only when there is
insufficient room in the Name field (16 bytes).  The longnames member can be
empty, though its header must appear.
 The strings are null-terminated. Each string begins immediately after the
null byte in the previous string.

 
Appendix: Example Object File
This section describes the PE/COFF object file produced by compiling the file
HELLO2.C, which contains the following small C program:
 
main()
{
foo();
}

foo()
{
}

The commands used to compile HELLO.C (with debug information) and generate
this example were the following (the -Gy option to the compiler is used, which
causes each procedure to be generated as a separate COMDAT section):
 
cl -c -Zi -Gy hello2.c
link -dump -all hello2.obj >hello2.dmp

Here is the resulting file HELLO2.DMP: (The reader is encouraged to experiment
with various other examples, in order to clarify the concepts described in
this specification.)
