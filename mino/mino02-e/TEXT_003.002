Dictionary of Virus Terms and Expressions #1...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

     The active production of viruses and the advances which have
been achieved in this respect have brought a whole new terminology
into being which, to the uninitiated, sounds intriguing, bysterious
and incomprehensible.  Other terms exist beyond those used in the
virus world, but even those have acquired a new significance
relative to virus terminology.  For this reason we, the staff of
Minotauro Magazine, have decided to produce a new Dictionary of
Virus Terms and Expressions.  If you believe that any terms were
overlooked, please let us know by leaving us mail at any BBS
mentioned in the editorial.  Please do the same if you find that
any of the definitions given is incorrect in any way.

Activation:    The "effect" of the virus.  Most viruses really
have NO "effect" whatsoever, limiting themselves to reproduction
(sometimes using some techniques to protect themselves).  The
"effect" can be destructive, stupid, funny or anything else.  It
can be triggered by system time or date, calls to certain system
functions, number of infections, etc., etc., etc,

Anti-Debugging:    A number of programming techniques designed to
make it as difficult as possible to debug a virus.  The techniques
are not infallible, but can be a real headache for anyone who wants
to study a virus.

Anti-Disassembly:    A number of techniques designed to make it as
difficult as possible to a virus by using a disassembler program. 
The techniques include code designed to "confuse" the disassembler.

Background:    We speak of background when a program is running
"parallel" to a program being executed.  (For example: DOS).

Boot Sector:    The first sector of a disk.  It contains the BPB
(BIOS Parameter Block), a table which specifies the format and type
of disk.  It also includes a small boot program (on system disks)
or the message "Non-system disk or disk error" (on non-system
disks).  Also, on hard drives the first sector contains a partition
table which in turn contains the the sectors in which can be found
the boot sectors of each of the disk partitions, and other
information regarding these.

Bug:    A program error which causes it to malfunctionor not run
at all.  For example, a "bug" in a virus caould cause it destroy
rather than infect a file.

Carrier:    The executable generated upon assembling the original
source of a virus.

Cluster:    Shit, how the fuck do you define a cluster?


CMOS:    A type of memory which survives machine power-downs.  It
contains the configuration information, such as disk and monitor
type, etc. (only exists on ATs).  Some viruses (extremely few)
modify CMOS to invert the boot order (from A:, then C: to C: then
A:) to prevent a clean boot from the A: drive.

Debugger:    A programa used to study the way other programs work
(also used to study viruses).

Directory Stealth:    A techniqur used to hide a virus.  It
consistes of subtracting the size of the virus from the shown by
the DOS DIR command.  (Viruses which use this techniques are
usually known as "semi-stealth").

Disinfect-On-The-Fly:    A (file) stealth technique in which a file
is disinfected on open, usually to spoof an antivirus product.  The
file is re-infected on close (of course! otherwise the virus would
not be effective).

Disassembler:    A program which will produce source code from an
executable.

Fast Infector:    A type of virus distinguished by the speed of
it's dispersion.  It accomplishes this not only when the file is
executed, but also when it is accessed by any means (open, copy,
reads, etc.)

FAT: File Allocation Table.     The "map" through which DOS "knows"
which clusters are in use and the files to which they belong, etc.

File Stealth:     As opposed to DIR-stealth, a virus which uses
advanced techniques to prevent detection.

Full Stealth:     A virus in which the stealth techniques are so
well implemented that it's not detected when it's active in memory.

It manages this through the interception of a boatload of system
functions, and there's even stealth which is undetectable at the
BIOS level (via INT 13).

Virus Generator:     A virus-making program which allows anyone
with a bare minimum of knowledge to "write" a virus.  Examples:
VCL, PS/MPC, etc.

Hacked virus:     A pejorative way of saying "strain".  Usually, a
hacked virus is simply one to which minor alterations have been
made by an individual other than the author of the original.

Handle:    The 'nickname' of a virus author.  It usually has
demonic or evil overtones, a "strange" sound, etc.  Virus authors
and just about anyone in the underground are known by their
"handles"; no one really cares about their real names.

Header EXE:     A structure found at the beginning of all EXEs
which contains the information necessary to run the EXE.  

Host:    An infected program.  (See Overwriting and Parasitic)

Infection-On-Close:    Infect when the file is closed, rather than
when it is run.

Lamer:    Insult, roughly translatable to "Pendejo imbecil"
(closest English approximation is "dumb shit').    In English,
works well in combination with the term "asshole".

MCB: Memory Control Block.     A part of DOS used to allocate
memory, which in turn is used by viruses to become memory resident
in the least suspicious way possible.  Viruses which use this
technique to get into memory will either decrease the total size
reported or are recognizable by a last block which belongs to the
system (actually the virus).

Multipartite:     A virus which is simultaneaously both a boot and
file infector.  They tend to be more complex than the viruses which
infect only boot sectors or only files.  The interaction between
the boot and file infections generally gives better results in the
way the virus works.

New Header EXE:    A type of header common to Windows EXEs.

Non-Resident:    A virus which replicates only when executed. 
Though less effective than their resident counterparts (the way
they function does not permit the use of stealth techniques), they
are still considered 'respectable', unlike the overwriting viruses,
since they can achieve a certain measure of success in dispersion.

Overwriting:    A virus which destroys the file(s) it infects. 
This type of virus does not spread far and is consodered primitive.

Parasitic:    A virus which preserves its infected host program in
order to run it later (as if it weren't infected).

Payload:     See "Activation".

Polimorphism:    A way of hiding a virus in such a way that it is
nearly impossible to detect it with a scanner, varying the code
from infection to infection in such a way that a scan string cannot
be extracted.  This is done by encrypting the virus code and by
varying the encryption routine as much as possible.

Residente:    A virus which, when executed, loads itself into
memory and remains in the background until it is called upon to
infect.

Root:    Root Directory, the first directory on the drive.

Runtime:    See "Non-Resident"

Sector:    One of the "pieces" into which a disk is divided.  To
BIOS, the sectors are "physical" and references them through thre
coordidates: side, track and sector.  DOS uses logical sectors
which are referenced by a number.  For example: 
Side 1, track 1, sector 1  ==> Sector 0 (DOS)

Setup:     The famous setup.  This is a program loaded in BIOS,
from which the system configuration is managed.  For example:
number of sectors on the hard drive, system date, etc.

SFT:    System File Table. A table which contains information
referring to an open file.  Viruses use this for all kinds of
things, since the information this table contains is extensive and
valuable.

Stealth:     In general, the term stealth is applied to a virus if
it uses any technique to avoid detection.  

Strain:    A variant, a subspecies of a virus.  In general, it has
some improvement over the original.  If there is no improvement
it's usually called a "hack".

String:    A "chain" of characters used to recognize an infected
file.  It's only a PART, not all of the virus.  Strings are
generally teaken from the infection routines.  Polymorphic viruses
were created presicely to avoid the possibility of a string being
found in common from infection to infection.

Toolkit:    A library, of sorts, which is included in a virus in
order to give it some advanced technique such as polymorphism or
tunneling.  Note that there can never be a stealth toolkit per se,
since that type of technique is an integral part of the virus and
cannot be isolated in a toolkit.

Trigger:    This the section in the virus code in charge of
determining whether the requisites which will make the virus go
active are met.  These may be, for example, a specific time or
date, number of infections, etc.

Trojan:    A program especially designed to cause damage.  
Sometimes confused with viruses, though the two have little in
common except that some viruses cause damage, too.

Tunneling:    A "protection" technique, of the anti-virus type,
which basically consists  of passing "beneath" resident antivirus
programs which monitor unusual activity.  It obtains the address of
the original Int it "thinks" is being monitored and uses this
address to access it.

Virus:    A code capable of reproducing itself across systems and
computers.  They are classified primarily by the way they reproduce
(Boot sector, file, cluster) and secondly by the techniques they
use to avoid detection (stealth, polymorphism, etc.).

Virus, boot:    A type of virus which reproduces itself by
replacing a boot sector.  Once it is installed in memory, it runs
the original boot sector.

Virus, file:    This type of virus reproduces by the executables on
a disk.  The are divided into .COM, .SYS and .EXE infectors (and
lately, Windows EXE infectors.)

Virus, cluster:    A new and relatively obscure type of virus.  To
infect, it does not modify the file, just the entry into the file's
directory.  Only one virus of this type exists, the celebrated 
DIR-2.
