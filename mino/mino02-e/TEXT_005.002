A Good Application for ANSI Codes.....BOMBS!...
-------------------------------------------------------------------

     Well, in case you didn't know it, ANSI is a controller which
handles a number of screen and keyboard functions.  We are
interested in the latter.  [If you don't have ANSI,SYS, please call
MicroSoft and buy MS-DOS (the original, of course. :-)]  If you
already have the controller, let's begin.

    The great advantage of this driver is the ability to redirect
the keyboard.  What does this mean??  Ok, this means that this
driver can be programmed in such a way as to change the function of
a specific key.  Got it?

     What I'm leading up to is, once ANSI has been loaded, I can
redefine the keys on the system.  For example, instead of typing  
"DIR C:\WORKS", I could just press the "A" key.  The logic is this:

     A <== DIR C:\WORKS <ENTER>

Every time I press the "A" key I'll see the contents of that
directory.  This property can be used in other types of
applications :-).  For that reason, ANSI bombs are very useful.  If
we can slip one of the "bombs" into a system, we can gain control
of it at some point in the future.  

     An example:  I'm having a bad day.....  everything is going
wrong...  here comes a computer jock and starts busting my balls. 
Sooo... since I know how to set up ANSI bombs, I program a quick
little bomb so that as soon as he runs it, it will reprogram the
space bar to format his hard drive.  This guy can't blame you,
since all you gave him is a pretty screen saver.  Then again, this
guy may be aware of ANSI bombs, in which case we're fucked.

Here's the ANSI code syntax:

No need to be afraid of the strange codes; the syntax is as
described and that's it.

ESC[x,yH       
   Move the cursor to an absolute position on the screen.
   Where 'x' is the Column and 'y' is the line.
   If the parameters aren't explicit, the cursor is moved to the  
   beginning of the screen.

ESC[nA
   Move the cursor up, where 'n' is the number of line the cursor 
   will move.  If the cursor reaches the top of the screen, it will 
   remain there.

ESC[nB
   Move the cursor down, where 'n' is the number of lines the     
   cursor will move.  If it reaches the bottom of the screen, it  
   will remain there.

ESC[nC
   Move the cursor to the right, where 'n' is the number of spaces 
   the cursor is to move.  If the cursor reaches the end of the   
   line, it stays there.

ESC[nD
   Move the cursor to the left, where 'n' is the number of spaces 
   the cursor is to move.  If it reaches the beginning of the line 
   it stays there.

ESC[s
   Saves the current position of the cursor into a buffer (to be  
   restored later).  

ESC[u
   Restore the cursor's previous position (as saved by the previous 
   command).

ESC[2J
   Erases the screen and moves cursor to top left hand corner of  
   the screen (home).

ESC[K
   Erases the screen downwards, starting from and including the   
   current cursor position.

ESC[key;"command";13p
   Redirects the keyboard.
   All right, THIS is the function in which we're interested.
   KEY:   this is where we put the code we want to re-direct.  The 
   CODE, not the key (letter, etc.).  Each key on the keyboard has 
   a code and each combination has a different one.  Further down 
   is a list of all the key codes.  (If we forgot one, please tell 
   us.)

   Separated from KEY by a ";" (semicolon) is the COMMAND, or the
the code we will use to replace the one in the selected key.  This
string must go between either two single quotes or two double
quotes.  

   The 13 which is between "COMMAND"; and 'p' (lower case) is the
code for ENTER, since ENTER cannot be represented with ASCII codes.
 
   For example, if we want to make F1 (code 0;59) call for a
directory, we'd code:

        ESC[0;59;"dir";13p
   
   And if we want it to format a disk:

        ESC[0;59;"Echo Y|format c:/u";13p
   (The ECHO Y|, is to confirm the format.)
   
To execute 2 commands at the same time type them on the same line
with no intervening spaces between the commands.  The example below
redirects F1 and F2 to format 2 drives:


 ESC[0;59;"Echo S|format c:/u >nul";13pESC[0;60;"Echo S|format d:/u>nul";13p

Remarks:
^^^^^^^^
     Anyone already familiar with ANSI knows that there are other functions,
but they are moot in this case.  I wrote ESC in all the codes...  really,
it's not ESC but its ASCII, which is 27 decimal or 1b hex; its symbol is the
left-pointing arrow.  For an ANSI to take EFFECT it must be typed.

     A word of advice, don't send a bare-bones ANSI bomb since that would be
too obvious.  Send it in some kind of ANSI screen, preferably at the end,
just in case the key you selected is already redirected.

     That's all for today                     
   Until the next chapter........ Drako.
